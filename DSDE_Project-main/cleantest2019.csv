"['Nursing (all)', 'Education']","Identifying nursing research priorities in Vietnam: A modified delphi study†  2019 2019 Aungsuroch et al., published by Sciendo.There is no single study that has examined nursing research priorities in Vietnam. This study aimed to gain consensus from experts on the nursing research priorities in Vietnam. A three-round modified Delphi study was used in this study. A focus group discussion among experts was conducted in round I to identify the nursing research priorities (n=23). Data in round I were analyzed using content analysis. In round II, participants were invited to rate the importance of each nursing priority topic in a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, which had a 74% (n=17) response rate. In round III, the questionnaire was returned to the experts (n=17) until consensus was reached. Data from round II and round III were analyzed to produce mean score and final rank. The top 12 research priority lists were identified, which included subthemes and areas of possible investigations. All priorities were classified into three groups in the rank order, namely: (i) nursing management and leadership, which included (1) nursing care quality, (2) management and leadership of nurse managers, (3) nursing image, (4) professional nurse competency, and (5) human resource management; (ii) nursing education, which included (1) knowledge-specific domain, (2) the linkage between education and practice, and (3) nurse teacher workforce; and (iii) nursing service, which included (1) adult nursing concern, (2) patient safety, (3) public health nursing concern, and (4) quality of life of patients and nurses. Consensus among experts was achiever, and the findings are considered as the basis of resources to the most essential research needs in Vietnam."
"['Anatomy', 'Histology']","Evaluation of the sciatic nerve location regarding its relationship to the piriformis muscle Copyright  2020 Via MedicaBackground: The localisation of sciatic nerve (SN) is essential for the achievement of several procedures performed in the gluteal region. This study proposed to investigate the location of SN regarding its relationship to the piriformis (PM) by the line joining the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS), ischial tuberosity (IT) and greater trochanter (GT). Materials and methods: SN-PM relationship was examined in 204 specimens from 102 embalmed cadavers (55 males, 47 females). Distances between PSIS, IT and GT were measured. Midpoints of SN at the lower edge of PM (S1) and IT-GT line (S2) were marked. Perpendicular line from S1 to PSIS-GT (S1-R) and to PSIS-IT (S1-Q), were created and measured. Distances of PSIS-R, PSIS-Q (S1) and IT-S2 were measured and calculated into percentage of PSIS-GT, PSIS-IT and IT-GT lengths, respectively. Results: Regarding the classification of Beaton and Anson, three types of SN-PM relationship (a, b and c) were obtained. The percentage of type a, b and c was 74.02, 22.55 and 3.43, respectively. Symmetrical SN-PM relationship was found in 75.49%. The mean length of PSIS-IT, PSIS-GT and IT-GT in all types was 129.63 ± 11.89 mm, 151.34 ± 14.78 mm and 73.02 ± 10.20 mm, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found between types a and b (p = 0.013) in PSIS-IT length, whereas mean length of IT-GT and PSIS-GT showed no statistically significant difference between SN-PM types. PSIS-IT line passed SN at the lower edge of PM (S1) in 112 specimens (54.90%). In these cases, S1 and Q were the same point. A statistically significant difference was also found between types a and b (p = 0.023) in PSIS-Q (S1) length. The mean lengths of PSIS-Q (S1), PSIS-R and IT-S2 in term of percentage of PSIS-IT, PSIS-GT and IT-GT line in all types were 60.06 ± 5.90%, 54.19 ± 6.10%, and 37.87 ± 8.27%, respectively. The mean lengths of S1-R and S1-Q were 30.07 ± ± 8.30 mm and 6.54 ± 7.99 mm. Therefore, SN at S1 could be located at the point of 54.19 ± 6.10% of PSIS-GT length (R) with a distance of 30.07 ± 8.30 mm perpendicular to PSIS-GT line (S1-R). Since the PSIS-IT line did not pass SN at S1 in every case, it might not be suitable for localizing SN at S1. SN at S2 could be located at the point of 37.87 ± 8.27% of IT-GT line. No significant difference was found between types. Conclusions: Sciatic nerve can be localised by PSIS-GT and IT-GT lines without statistically significant difference between types (a, b, and c) of SN-PM relationship."

To investigate the potential determinants affecting the decision on selecting BCS or mastectomy for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer and to compare the disease-free survival and overall survival between the treatments using a propensity score-matched analysis. Patients diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer at the Queen Sirikit Breast Cancer Center from January 2006 to December 2015, were retrospectively identified and grouped intro patients who received BCS or mastectomy. After propensity score matching, 356 BCS and 209 mastectomy patients were identified, and statistical analysis was conducted to determine treatment selection factors and compare disease-free and overall survival. Disease-free survival and overall survival in months comparing BCS and mastectomy were not statistically different with P values of 0.11 and 0.77, respectively. Determinants of treatment selection found that younger age, surgeon preference, smaller tumor size, and lower tumor grade were statistically significant factors in the selection of BCS over mastectomy. The majority of surgeons had a preference for one treatment over the other (P < 0.001). The outcome of BCS is comparable to mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer patients. Key determinants affecting the selection of treatment were identified to be patient age, characteristics of the tumor, and surgeon's preference."

To determine the more recent incidence of these conditions and to compare the results with those reported 40 years ago by KCMH. The data were also compared with a recent report from Siriraj Hospital. We reviewed medical records of newborn infants from 2012 to 2016, all of whom were born in KCMH with deformities of upper and lower extremities or other birth-related injuries. The cases were grouped according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition. The incidence of common neonatal orthopedic problems was calculated as cases per 1,000 live births and compared, using a chi-squared test, with the earlier data from KCMH and with the data recently reported by Siriraj hospital. Of the 24,825 live births, 54% were male and 46% were female. The average birth weight was 3,052.2 ± 516.1 g (range, 535-5,320 g) for infants. The most common deformity was postural clubfoot, followed by calcaneovalgus and hip dysplasia, with incidences of 1.37, 0.93 and 0.52 per 1,000 live births, respectively. The incidence of calcaneovalgus, metatarsus adductus, and clubfoot was lower than in the 1975 study and in the report from Siriraj. In all 3 studies, the incidence of birth-related injury was similar and clavicular fracture was the most common, with a rate of 1.3/1,000 live births. The incidence of common neonatal orthopedic problems varies among institutions. Birth-related injury is a major challenge. The results may be utilized as updated data and as a starting point for parental education."

To assess the efficacy and subsequent pregnancy outcome of conservative surgical management for patients with immediate PPH. Medical records of patients who had PPH between January 2011 and December 2016 were reviewed. Conservative surgical management included B-Lynch uterine compression suture, Bakri balloon tamponade, and uterine artery ligation. The treatments were considered successful if patients did not require subsequent hysterectomy. Perioperative complications and subsequent pregnancy outcomes were recorded. Of 30,271 deliveries, 669 patients experienced PPH or 2.2% of total deliveries. Sixty-one patients (9.1%) did not respond to medical treatment with various uterotonic agents. Hysterectomy was selected initially in 30 patients. Conservative surgical management was performed in 31 patients: 15 Bakri balloon tamponade, 13 uterine compression suture, and 3 uterine artery ligation. There were 3 patients who failed Bakri balloon tamponade and proceeded to perform uterine compression suture with successful outcome. The success rates for conservative surgical treatment were 66.7%, 75%, and 66.7%, respectively. All patients who had successful conservative surgical management resumed normal menstruation. Three out of 11 patients (27.3%) who desired subsequent pregnancy were able to conceive and carry out a viable pregnancy. Conservative surgical management has acceptable success rates for controlling intractable immediate PPH. Implementation of such procedures should be done to preserve fertility and decrease maternal morbidity and mortality."
"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)']","Distinguishing magnetic resonance imaging features between idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis and secondary hypertrophic pachymeningitis  2019 2019 Warittikoon and Jakchairoongruang, published by Sciendo.Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by marked fibrous thickening of the cerebral and/or spinal dura mater. This condition is caused by infection, inflammation, autoimmune disorder, neoplasms, or idiopathic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may play an important role in differentiating idiopathic HP from secondary HP, may avoid unnecessarily invasive dural biopsy, and prompt specific treatment. To determine the specific MRI findings for differentiation between idiopathic HP and secondary HP. A total of 34 patients underwent MRI of the brain and cervical spine from January 2003 to December 2015. In all, 23 patients were diagnosed idiopathic HP and 11 patients were secondary HP. Demographic data and imaging findings reveal the following: Configuration, thickness, signal intensity on T1-weighted image (T1WI), T2-weighted image (T2WI), and enhancement pattern of the lesions. The data were analyzed by T-test and Fisher's exact test. Secondary HP were significantly located at anterior and middle cranial fossa (P = 0.033). There is no significant difference of lesions in configurations, T1 and T2 signal intensity and patterns of enhancement. There was significant and exclusive difference in T2 hypointense/dark intensity and homogeneous enhancement in idiopathic HP (75%, P = 0.044). MRI may play a complimentarily important role in distinguishing idiopathic HP from secondary HP. Idiopathic HP is probably preferred diagnosis in the lesions with T2-rim pattern and T2 hypointense/dark intensity with homogeneous enhancement."
['Plant Science'],"Transcriptome analysis of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica for gene discovery in the biosyntheses of isoflavones and miroestrol  2019 The Author(s).Background: Pueraria candollei var. mirifica, a Thai medicinal plant used traditionally as a rejuvenating herb, is known as a rich source of phytoestrogens, including isoflavonoids and the highly estrogenic miroestrol and deoxymiroestrol. Although these active constituents in P. candollei var. mirifica have been known for some time, actual knowledge regarding their biosynthetic genes remains unknown. Results: Miroestrol biosynthesis was reconsidered and the most plausible mechanism starting from the isoflavonoid daidzein was proposed. A de novo transcriptome analysis was conducted using combined P. candollei var. mirifica tissues of young leaves, mature leaves, tuberous cortices, and cortex-excised tubers. A total of 166,923 contigs was assembled for functional annotation using protein databases and as a library for identification of genes that are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids and miroestrol. Twenty-one differentially expressed genes from four separate libraries were identified as candidates involved in these biosynthetic pathways, and their respective expressions were validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Notably, isoflavonoid and miroestrol profiling generated by LC-MS/MS was positively correlated with expression levels of isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes across the four types of tissues. Moreover, we identified R2R3 MYB transcription factors that may be involved in the regulation of isoflavonoid biosynthesis in P. candollei var. mirifica. To confirm the function of a key-isoflavone biosynthetic gene, P. candollei var. mirifica isoflavone synthase identified in our library was transiently co-expressed with an Arabidopsis MYB12 transcription factor (AtMYB12) in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Remarkably, the combined expression of these proteins led to the production of the isoflavone genistein. Conclusions: Our results provide compelling evidence regarding the integration of transcriptome and metabolome as a powerful tool for identifying biosynthetic genes and transcription factors possibly involved in the isoflavonoid and miroestrol biosyntheses in P. candollei var. mirifica."

This work aims to compare the performance of a monofiber optical probe in characterizing the hydrodynamics in spray systems with that of a high-speed camera. Initially, both techniques determined the same series of droplets produced by a syringe. The droplet velocities and sizes obtained from the optical probe were in accordance with the high-speed camera when the droplet coalescence was filtered out from the data. Second, a full-cone spray nozzle was used and the average velocities from the two techniques were close, but the off-center collision on the probe and the difference in size limits caused the discrepancy in the size determination. However, the probe is still beneficial to determine the droplet hydrodynamics and local liquid fraction, the essential characteristics of a spray system."

The cutting force is proposed to predict the straightness and surface roughness. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to prove the relations of them by checking the frequencies of them. The cutting force ratio is proposed and normalized to predict the in-process surface roughness and straightness regardless of the cutting conditions. The surface roughness and the straightness are calculated simultaneously by employing the two-layer feed-forward neural networks with sigmoid hidden and linear output neurons. The neural networks is trained by using the Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation algorithm. It is understood that the surface roughness and the straightness can be estimated well by utilizing the proposed method under various cutting conditions."

Tiamulin persists in livestock manure, and its residues have been found in various environment. This work obtained four tiamulin-degrading enriched bacterial consortia from a covered anaerobic lagoon system and a stabilized pond system of swine farms. Tiamulin was efficiently removed by the enriched cultures at the concentrations between 2.5 and 200 mg/L, with a removal of 60.1-99.9% during 16 h and a degradation half-life of 4.5-15.7 h. The stabilized pond system cultured with taimulin solely could eliminate tiamulin at the highest rates. The logistic substrate degradation model fit most of the experimental data. Next-generation amplicon sequencing was conducted, and it was found that the bacterial community was significantly impacted by the inoculum source, nutrient addition, and high tiamulin concentrations. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) indicated the similarity of bacterial communities in the original enriched samples and the 2.5 mg/L tiamulin-removed cultures. The 200 mg/L consortia were rather different and became similar to the other 200 mg/L consortia from different sources and cultures without nutrient supplementation. Shannon and Simpson indices suggested a reduction in bacterial diversity at high concentrations. The microbes that had high growth in the most efficient enriched culture, or which were abundant in all samples, or which increased with higher tiamulin concentrations were likely to be the major tiamulin-degrading bacteria. This is the first report suggested the possible roles of Achromobacter, Delftia, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas in tiamulin degradation."
['Education'],"Impact of faculty development programme on self-efficacy, competency and attitude towards medical education in Bhutan: A mixed-methods study  2019 The Author(s).Background: Soon after Bhutan's first medical university was established in 2012, Faculty Development Programmes (FDPs) were adopted for efficient delivery of postgraduate medical curriculum. Medical education was an additional responsibility for the clinicians who already had multi-dimensional roles in the healthcare system where there is acute shortage of healthcare professionals. We studied the impact of FDPs on postgraduate medical education in Bhutan. Methods: This was a mixed-methods study with a quantitative (cohort study - quasi-experimental with 18 participants) and concurrent explanatory qualitative component (focused group discussion (FGD) with 11 teaching faculty members). The 18 participants were given a structured FDP designed by the University. The FGD assessed teacher self-efficacy and competency using standard tools before and after the FDP. Thematic analysis of the FGD explored the impact of FDPs in the delivery of postgraduate residency programmes. Results: There were significant increase in the teacher self-efficacy (31 vs 34, p = 0.009) and competency scores (56 vs 64, p = 0.011). There were significant improvements in self-efficacy in the domain of the teaching relevant subject contents and developing creative ways to cope with system constraints. In teaching-learning assessments, there was a significant appreciation of the effectiveness of lectures and tutorials and the use of essay questions. The FGD demonstrated the acceptance of FDPs and its importance in quality improvement of postgraduate medical education, professional development of teachers and improvement of their communication skills. The teachers have now migrated from the conventional methods of teaching to workplace-based teaching and assessment. The FDPs also resulted in review and revision of postgraduate medical curriculum soon after the first batch graduated in 2018. Lack of adequate support from relevant stakeholders and lack of a medical education centre in the University were seen as major challenges. Conclusions: The FDPs have brought tangible professionalization of postgraduate medical education at an early stage of the medical university. There is a need for continued efforts to strengthen, sustain and consolidate the gains made thus far."

['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"Search for low mass vector resonances decaying into quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2019 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.A search for low mass narrow vector resonances decaying into quark-antiquark pairs is presented. The analysis is based on data collected in 2017 with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.1 fb-1. The results of this analysis are combined with those of an earlier analysis based on data collected at the same collision energy in 2016, corresponding to 35.9 fb-1. Signal candidates will be recoiling against initial state radiation and are identified as energetic, large-radius jets with two pronged substructure. The invariant jet mass spectrum is probed for a potential narrow peaking signal over a smoothly falling background. No evidence for such resonances is observed within the mass range of 50-450 GeV. Upper limits at the 95%confidence level are set on the coupling of narrow resonances to quarks, as a function of the resonance mass. For masses between 50 and 300 GeV these are the most sensitive limits to date. This analysis extends the earlier search to a mass range of 300-450 GeV, which is probed for the first time with jet substructure techniques."

However, a study of the direct and indirect effects between disruptive behaviors in children with ADHD and parental anxiety and coping strategies is apparently lacking. To examine the direct and indirect relationship between disruptive behaviors in children with ADHD and parental anxiety and coping strategies as a mediator. A cross-sectional study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand between March 2015 and January 2016. Participants comprised 200 parents whose children were diagnosed with ADHD by physicians. Participants completed questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics including The Thai Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, The Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP-IV): Parent form (Thai version), and The Coping Scale Questionnaire (Thai version). The direct path between disruptive behaviors and anxiety was significant (b = 0.21, P = 0.002). Moreover, a significant indirect path was found between disruptive behaviors and coping behavior with escape-avoidance (β = 0.20, P = 0.005), and an indirect path was found between escape-avoidance and anxiety (b = 0.31, P <0.001).

To investigate the changes in bacterial protein patterns by AgNPs capped with poly (4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) (AgNPs-PSSMA) polymer toward Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. The growth of bacteria after incubated with AgNPs-PSSMA for different time intervals was determined by optical density at 600 nm. Their protein patterns were observed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the proteomic analysis of extracted proteins was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). AgNPs-PSSMA was able to inhibit the growth of both S. aureus and E. coli cells. The treated bacterial cells expressed more proteins than the untreated cells as seen from SDS-PAGE study. Nanosilver (NS) caused the upregulation of metabolic gene, waaA, in S. aureus cells. For E. coli cells, the upregulated proteins were metabolic genes (srlB, fliE, murD) and other genes dealt with DNA replication (dinG), DNA-RNA transcription (yrdD), RNA-protein translation (rplD), molecular transport (sapF), and signal transduction (tdcF).

['Medicine (all)'],"A double masked randomised 4-week, placebo-controlled study in the USA, Thailand and Taiwan to compare the efficacy of oral valganciclovir and topical 2% ganciclovir in the treatment of cytomegalovirus anterior uveitis: Study protocol   Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Introduction Cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis is a recognised cause of anterior uveitis in immunocompetent patients and is preventable cause of vision loss. Ocular sequelae include corneal endothelial damage which can cause corneal oedema and failure, as well as glaucoma. Recurrences of inflammation are common and therefore patients are often exposed to long-term therapy. Oral therapy is available in the form of valganciclovir, although with the caveat of systemic side effects such as bone marrow suppression and renal failure necessitating regular interval laboratory monitoring. Recent reports have demonstrated that topical 2% ganciclovir solution may offer promising treatment outcomes in patients with CMV anterior uveitis with superior safety, cost-effectiveness and convenience profiles. An investigation into the relative equipoise of these therapies is warranted for these reasons. Methods and analysis The Systemic and Topical Control of Cytomegalovirus Anterior uveitis: Treatment Outcomes (STACCATO) trial is designed as a multicentre, block randomised by site, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of oral valganciclovir, 2% topical ganciclovir and placebo in treating PCR-proven CMV anterior uveitis. Participant clinical evaluation will occur at three study time points by a masked study ophthalmologist over a 28-day period to assess resolution of ocular inflammation (secondary outcome). A control group will provide additional information about the possible impact that the infected host's immune response may play in controlling local viral replication.

['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"Probing the chiral magnetic wave in pPb and PbPb collisions at √SNN = 5.02 TeV using charge-dependent azimuthal anisotropies  2019 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.Charge-dependent anisotropy Fourier coefficients (νn) of particle azimuthal distributions are measured in pPb and PbPb collisions at √SNN = 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The normalized difference in the second-order anisotropy coefficients (ν2) between positively and negatively charged particles is found to depend linearly on the observed event charge asymmetry with comparable slopes for both pPb and PbPb collisions over a wide range of charged particle multiplicity. In PbPb, the third-order anisotropy coefficient ν3 shows a similar linear dependence with the same slope as seen for ν2. The observed similarities between the ν2 slopes for pPb and PbPb, as well as the similar slopes for ν2 and ν3 in PbPb, are compatible with expectations based on local charge conservation in the decay of clusters or resonances, and constitute a challenge to the hypothesis that, at LHC energies, the observed charge asymmetry dependence of ν2 in heavy ion collisions arises from a chiral magnetic wave."

All rights reserved.The neuritogenicity and the neuroregenerative potential of asiaticoside (AS) and its aglycone, asiatic acid (AA), has been generally reported. We recently identified the participation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt) in the neuritogenic mechanism of AS and AA. In this study, we further investigated the possible upstream target molecule and the associated downstream signaling of both triterpenoids in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells. Our immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays revealed that either AS or AA exerted neurite extension activity through inhibitory effect on glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA). AS appeared significantly more potent in promoting neurite elongation than AA, and concurrently expressed a higher degree of inhibition on GSK3β and RhoA activations. The mediation of GSK3β and RhoA activities in AS-treated cells involved Akt signaling. Moreover, when using GW441756, a specific tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptor signaling inhibitor, the ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, the inhibitory effects on GSK3β and RhoA and the neurite outgrowth induced by AS, but not AA, were totally suppressed. In conclusion, our findings supported the different upstream regulators of AS and AA in promoting neuritogenicity in Neuro-2a cells. Although both AS and AA could enhance neurite elongation through the suppression of GSK3β and RhoA activities, only AS could modulate the effect through TrkA receptor signaling."
['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Application of pivoting adversarial networks in search for four top quark production in CMS  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.One burden of high energy physics data analysis is uncertainty within the measurement, both systematically and statistically. Even with sophisticated neural network techniques that are used to assist in high energy physics measurements, the resulting measurement may suffer from both types of uncertainties. Fortunately, most types of systematic uncertainties are based on knowledge from information such as theoretical assumptions, for which the range and behaviour are known. It has been proposed to mitigate such systematic uncertainties by using a new type of neural network called adversarial neural network (ANN) that would make the discriminator less sensitive to these uncertainties, but this has not yet been demonstrated in a real-life LHC analysis. This work investigates ANNs using as a benchmark the search for the production of four top quarks, an extremely rare physics process at the LHC and one of the important processes that can prove or disprove the Standard Model. The search for four top quarks in some cases is sensitive to large systematic uncertainties. The expected cross section upper limit for four top quark production is calculated using traditional neural networks and adversarial neural networks based on simulated proton-proton collisions within the Compact Muon Solenoid detector within Large Hadron Collider, and are compared to existing results. The improvement and further considerations to the search for rare processes at the LHC will be discussed."

['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Effects of few optical cycles approximation to spectral broadening generated in two-zero dispersion wavelengths fibers  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.It is both experimentally and numerically confirmed that Supercontinuum can be generated by pumping a few-tens-femtoseconds short pulse in anomalous dispersion region of a two zero-dispersion wavelengths (ZDW) fiber, such as, photonic crystal fiber. In numerical method, a well-known slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) has always been used to illustrate how the short pulse expands to a broadband spectrum in two-ZDWs fiber. But, the limit of SVEA is that it can only be applied for the short pulse, which its temporal envelope changes slowly comparing with its optical cycle. However, a few optical cycles short pulse is not fit with the condition of the SVEA approximation. In this report, another model, namely slowly evolving wave approximation (SEWA), is applied for numerical demonstration of supercontinuum generated by pumping the few optical cycles short pulse in two-ZDWs fiber. According to our simulation, under SEWA the final spectral width of the very short input pulse in the two-ZDWs fiber is between about 500-2000 nm, even the center wavelength of input pulse is near second-ZDW of fiber. Moreover, other effects of these two approximations since the center wavelength of the very short input pulse is close to both upper and lower ZDWs of the fiber in the same fiber's length are also compared in our presentation."

We found that the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition corresponding to the rotational U(1) symmetry breaking and the Ising-like (I) transition corresponding to the reflection Z 2 symmetry breaking occur at two-separate transition temperatures, Tkt < TI . These temperatures lie close to each other, however in our results the separation is obvious. Our results show the order parameters as a function of temperature and we also estimate the critical exponents, β, , γ, η and ν. The critical exponent ν indicates that the Ising-like transition is inconsistent with the Ising universality class."

For the non-negative Gaussian curvatures, we present the preliminary results in cylindrical and spherical cases. To be specific we use the deformed hyperbolic solutions to obtain eigenvalues of the Dirac equation in the presence of an axial gauge field. Our results demonstrate the quantized energy and eigenstates of fermion. The quantization of energy depends on the spin-orbit coupling and the Landau quantization. The imaginary energy is obtained from the negative Gaussian curvatures. It is interpreted as the quasi normal mode (QNM). The angular momentum of fermion is shifted by addition of the constant magnetic flux. The fermion behaves like boson when the flux is half-integer."
['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Comparison of electron temperature in DC glow discharge and AC glow discharge plasma  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Knowing electron temperature and electron density is important for any plasma related applications. In this research, the electron temperature and electron density of argon plasma generated by low frequency AC power supply and a high voltage DC power supply were investigated. The measurements were compared, both experimentally and theoretically. For the experiment, a long glass cylindrical tube was used as a chamber where the electrodes were placed at 37.5 cm apart. A high voltage function generator power supply was operated at various frequencies and it was also used for DC operation. The electron temperatures were measured by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) technique for different operating pressures of 0.1 mbar, 0.6 mbar and 1.1 mbar. For the simulation, both plasma theory and finite element method were used to simulate dynamics of the plasma in the cylindrical setup. From the experiment, the range of breakdown voltage was found to be between 0.80 to 2.3 kV. The length of DC glow discharge dark regions of the plasma decreases due to increasing in both operating pressure and voltage. AC glow discharge shows positive charge and negative charge swing. From the DC discharge, the maximum value of electron temperature was found to be 0.810 eV and the minimum value was 0.610 eV under the operating pressure 0.1 and 0.6 mbar respectively. From AC glow discharge plasma, the maximum electron temperature was 0.907 eV and the minimum was 0.540 eV under operating pressure 0.1 and 1.1 mbar respectively. Collision loss between ions and electrons causes this variation in the results."
['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"An array of coupled nonlinear oscillators as a model for amplitude variations in intermodulation distortions from the auditory system  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The response of a nonlinear oscillator driven by two or more forces displays several frequency components corresponding to the linear combinations of the driving frequencies, known as intermodulation distortions (IMDs). The auditory system of all classes of vertebrates produces strong IMDs in the presence of sounds of two tones. This phenomenon is attributed to the nonlinearity of the biological acoustic sensors within the inner ear. In this work, we developed a numerical model to investigate the total IMDs generated by a chain of coupled nonlinear oscillators. Total nonlinear distortions exhibited variations in amplitudes with respect to the stimulus frequency. The variation profile was sensitive to the magnitude of the driving forces and the difference in the two driving frequencies. We found that the arrangement of the oscillators' characteristic frequencies was necessary for the variations in total IMD level. Results from the numerical model agreed with measurements of IMDs from Chinese edible frog (Hoplobatrachus Rugulosus), whose inner ear is constituted by arrays of acoustic receptors with progressively increasing natural frequencies. In response to sounds of two tones, IMDs produced by the inner ear of Chinese edible frog exhibited variations in amplitudes with respect to the driving frequencies. The third-order distortion level displayed several peaks at high stimulating sound pressure level, and at large differences between the stimulus frequencies. Our findings suggest that an array of coupled nonlinear oscillator can serve as a simple model for the generation of nonlinear distortions by the inner ear."

The two-step spin coating technique has been employed to fabricate the absorber films. It has been found that the use of anti-solvents plays a crucial role on the growth of the perovskite crystals. Chlorobenzene (CB) and Toluene (TO) were chosen as the anti-solvents that were applied after spin-coating of Methylammonium Iodide (MAI) solution in the second step of the two-step process. The amount and the elapsed time of the application of anti-solvents after spinning MAI solution were varied and studied for the crystal growth of perovskite films as well as the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It was found that 50 ml of CB applied at 5 s after spinning MAI solution yielded the best solar cells parameters with the best efficiency of 16.8 %."

We focus on the time evolution of the equal-time correlation functions to test the dynamical scaling hypothesis and to determine the governing growth laws. We find that at late times the system has two different behaviours which are a non-shear behaviour and a uniformly sheared behaviour. Initial phases and frequencies of oscillatory shear determine the behaviour of the system. On one hand, if the frequency is high, the system behaves as if it is not under shear. On the other hand, if the frequency is approached zero, the behaviour of the system will be determined by the initial phase of oscillatory shear. At the initial phase of 90 degree (or 270 degree), the system also behaves as if it is not under shear. Otherwise, the system behaves as if it is under uniform shear (Oscillatory shear is in the form of cosine function)."
['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Extracting overlapping 2D-images by central-derivatives-based algorithm  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Usual algorithms, such as, 5-steps and a backward-derivatives-based (BDB) method, could extract an image of a top layer from a one of a base layer in a 2D full-field optical coherent tomography (FFOCT). Those both algorithms still give the robust images. For improving the quality of the image in 2D-FFOCT, in this research a central-derivatives-based (CDB) algorithm is introduced to apply for investigating two overlapping 2D images. According to our simulation, it shows that the performance of CDB-algorithm is as good as the one of 5-step algorithm in case a phase difference between each fringe images is not more than 40 degree. It is also less robust by comparing with the one of BDB-algorithm. By our experimental results, it can also be concluded that the CDB-algorithm can separate two overlapping 2D images with more brightness than the ones applied by BDB-algorithm."
['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Effects of surface diffusion length on steady-state persistence probabilities  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The dependence of the steady-state persistence probabilities (Ps) and exponents (θs) on surface diffusion length (l) for four discrete growth models is investigated. The persistence exponents which describe the decay of the persistence probabilities, the probabilities of the average of all initial height (h 0), are increased as l is increased for all models. The results of one-dimensional Family ((1+1)-Family) and Das Sarma-Tamborenea ((1+1)-DT) models with kinetically rough film surface show the decrease of the growth exponent (β) with l. The l>1 results preserve the relation. In contrast, β is observed to increase with l for the two-dimensional larger curvature ((2+1)-LC) and Wolf-Villain ((2+1)-WV) models with mounded morphology. Our results show that the relation is not valid in l>1 cases in models with mounded surfaces. The persistence probabilities of a specific value of initial height (Ps (h 0)) for l>1 are found to behave differently between mounded and kinetically rough models."
"['Rheumatology', 'Immunology and Allergy', 'Immunology']","Performance of cytokine models in predicting SLE activity  2019 The Author(s).Background: Identification of universal biomarkers to predict systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Several biomarkers have been reported. However, the data of validated biomarkers to use as a predictor for lupus flares show variation. This study aimed to identify the biomarkers that are sensitive and specific to predict lupus flares. Methods: One hundred and twenty-four SLE patients enrolled in this study and were prospectively followed up. The evaluation of disease activity achieved by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI-2K) and clinical SLEDAI (modified SLEDAI). Patients with active SLE were categorized into renal or non-renal flares. Serum cytokines were measured by multiplex bead-based flow cytometry. The correlation and logistic regression analysis were performed. Results: Levels of IFN-α, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 significantly increased in active SLE and correlated with clinical SLEDAI. Complement C3 showed a weakly negative relationship with IFN-α and IL-18. IL-18 showed the highest positive likelihood ratios for active SLE. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 significantly increased odds ratio (OR) for active SLE at baseline while complement C3 and IL-18 increased OR for active SLE at 12 weeks. IL-18 and IL-6 yielded higher sensitivity and specificity than anti-dsDNA and C3 to predict active renal and active non-renal, respectively. Conclusion: The heterogeneity of SLE pathogenesis leads to different signaling mechanisms and mediates through several cytokines. The monitoring of cytokines increases the sensitivity and specificity to determine SLE disease activity. IL-18 predicts the risk of active renal SLE while IL-6 and IL-8 predict the risk of active non-renal. The sensitivity and specificity of these cytokines are higher than the anti-dsDNA or C3. We propose to use the serum level of IL-18, IL-6, and IL-8 to monitor SLE disease activity in clinical practice."

This study aimed to assess the availability of emergency obstetric and newborn care in Sindh Province of Pakistan. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in twelve districts of the Sindh province in Pakistan. The districts were selected based on the maternal neonatal and child health indicators. Data were collected from 63 public-sector health facilities including district, Taluka (subdistrict) headquarters hospitals and rural health centers. Basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric newborn care services were assessed through direct observations and interviews with the heads of the health facilities by using a World Health Organization pretested and validated data collection tool. Participants interviewed in this study included the managers and auxiliary staff and in health facilities. Results: Availability of caesarean section (23, 95% C.I. 14.0-35.0) and blood transfusion services (57, 95% CI. 44.0-68.0), the two components of comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care, was poor in our study. However, assessment of the seven components of basic emergency obstetric and newborn services showed that 92% of the health facilities (95% C.I. 88.0-96.0) had parenteral antibiotics, 90%, (95% C.I. 80.0-95.0) had oxytocin, 92% (95% CI 88.0-96.0) had manual removal of the placenta service, 87% (95%, C.I. 76.0-93.0) of the facilities had staff who could remove retained products of conception, 82% (95% C.I. 71.0-89.0) had facilities for normal birth and 80% (95% C.I. 69.0-88.0) reported presence of neonatal resuscitation service. Conclusion: Though the basic obstetric and newborn services were reasonably available, comprehensive obstetric and newborn services were not available as per the World Health Organization's standards in the surveyed public health facilities. Ensuring the availability of caesarean section and blood transfusion services within these facilities may improve population's access to these essential services around birth."
['Health Policy'],"The impact of National Health Insurance upon accessibility of health services and financial protection from catastrophic health expenditure: A case study of Savannakhet province, the Lao People's Democratic Republic  2019 The Author(s).Introduction: Many schemes have been implemented by the government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic to provide equity in health service utilisation. Initially, health service utilisations were fully supported by the government and were subsequently followed by the Revolving Drug Fund. In the 2000s, four health financing schemes, namely the Social Security Organization, the State Authority for Social Security, the Health Equity Fund and Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI), were introduced with various target groups. However, as these voluntary schemes have suffered from a very low enrolment rate, the government decided to pilot the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, which offers a flat, co-payment system for health service utilisation. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the NHI in terms of its accessibility and in providing financial protection from catastrophic health expenditure. Methods: The data collection process was implemented in hospitals of two districts of Savannakhet province. A structured questionnaire was used to retrieve all required information from 342 households; the information comprised of the socioeconomics of the household, accessibility to health services and financial payment for both outpatient and inpatient department services. Binary logistic regression models were used to discover the impact of NHI in terms of accessibility and financial protection. The impact of NHI was then compared with the outcomes of the preceding, voluntary CBHI scheme, which had been the subject of earlier studies. Results: Under the NHI, it was found that married respondents, large households and the level of income significantly increased the probability of accessibility to health service utilisation. Most importantly, NHI significantly improved accessibility for the poorest income quantile. In terms of financial protection, households with an existing chronic condition had a significantly higher chance of suffering financial catastrophe when compared to households with healthy members. As probability of catastrophic expenditure was not affected by income level, it was indicated that NHI is able to provide equity in financial protection. Conclusion: The models found that the NHI significantly enhances accessibility for poor income households, improving health service distribution and accessibility for the various income levels when compared to the CBHI coverage. Additionally, it was also found that NHI had enhanced financial protection since its introduction. However, the NHI policy requires a dramatically high level of government subsidy; therefore, there its long-term sustainability remains to be determined."

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Identification of the amino-acid motifs in proteins that are targeted for post-translational modifications (PTMs) is of great importance in understanding regulatory networks. Information about targeted motifs can be derived from mass spectrometry data that identify peptides containing specific PTMs such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation. Comparison of input data against a standardized 'background' set allows identification of over-and under-represented amino acids surrounding the modified site. Conventionally, calculation of targeted motifs assumes a random background distribution of amino acids surrounding the modified position. However, we show that probabilities of amino acids depend on (i) the type of the modification and (ii) their positions relative to the modified site. Thus, software that identifies such over-and under-represented amino acids should make appropriate adjustments for these effects. Here we present a new program, PTM-Logo, that generates representations of these amino acid preferences ('logos') based on position-specific amino-acid probability backgrounds calculated either from user-input data or curated databases."

We investigated the association between the timing of ART initiation and time-to-suppression among infants who tested HIV-positive and initiated ART within the first 28 days of life. The effect was estimated using cumulative probability flexible parametric spline models and a multivariable generalized additive mixed model was performed to test nonlinear associations. Forty-four neonates were included. Nineteen (43.2%) initiated ART within 7 days of life and 25 (56.8%) from 8 to 28 days. Infants treated within 7 days were 4-fold more likely to suppress earlier than those treated after 7 days [Hazard ratio (HR) 4.01 (1.7-9.5)]. For each week the ART initiation was delayed, the probability of suppression decreased by 35% (HR 0.65 [0.46-0.92]). Age at ART start was linearly associated with time-to-suppression. However, a linear association with normally distributed residuals was not found between baseline viral load and time-to-suppression, with no association found when baseline viral loads were ≤5 log(10) copies/mL, but with exponential increase in time-to-suppression with > log5 copies/mL at baseline. Starting ART within 7 days of life led to 4-fold faster time to viral suppression, in comparison to initiation from 8 to 28 days."

Understanding the epidemiology and factors for LTFU is complicated by varying LTFU definitions.Setting:Asian regional cohort incorporating 16 pediatric HIV services across 6 countries.Methods:Data from PHIVA (aged 10-19 years) who received combination antiretroviral therapy 2007-2016 were used to analyze LTFU through (1) an International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) method that determined LTFU as >90 days late for an estimated next scheduled appointment without returning to care and (2) the absence of patient-level data for >365 days before the last data transfer from clinic sites. Descriptive analyses and competing-risk survival and regression analyses were used to evaluate LTFU epidemiology and associated factors when analyzed using each method.Results:Of 3509 included PHIVA, 275 (7.8%) met IeDEA and 149 (4.3%) met 365-day absence LTFU criteria. Cumulative incidence of LTFU was 19.9% and 11.8% using IeDEA and 365-day absence criteria, respectively. Risk factors for LTFU across both criteria included the following: age at combination antiretroviral therapy initiation <5 years compared with age ≥5 years, rural clinic settings compared with urban clinic settings, and high viral loads compared with undetectable viral loads. Age 10-14 years compared with age 15-19 years was another risk factor identified using 365-day absence criteria but not IeDEA LTFU criteria.Conclusions:Between 12% and 20% of PHIVA were determined LTFU with treatment fatigue and rural treatment settings consistent risk factors.

The study area was Dang-Yai subdistrict, Baan Mai Chaiyapot district, Buriram province, Thailand. The sampling of particulate matter of less than 10 μm (PM10) was performed from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day between 14th and 18th December 2015 inclusively. The PM10 was collected on a glass fiber filter using a nylon cyclone connected to a personal air pump with an air flow rate of 1.7 L/min. The samples were extracted by a microwave digester, and the metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The average exposure concentrations of the workers to Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb were 0.0073 ± 0.0084, 0.2083 ± 0.6362, 0.3499 ± 0.3738 and 0.1297 ± 0.1746 μg/m3, respectively.

The resultant nanostructured La2O3 possessed high specific surface area of 211.5 m2/g, and Ni/La2O3-m catalysts maintained the initial morphology upon thermal treatment. The mesostructure was beneﬁcial to obtain and maintain Ni nanoparticles with sizes between 4–6 nm. Ni/La2O3-m catalysts exhibited superior activity and stability in dry reforming of methane, showing excellent performance in activating both CH4 and CO2 due to more catalytically active Ni sites and increased interfaces. In situ DRIFTS indicated that bidentate carbonate participates in coke elimination. Combined with CO2-TPD and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that Ni/La2O3-m catalyst has stronger capability to promote the formation of bidentate carbonate due to the increased interfaces by enhancing Ni dispersion, which leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition."

Here, we report a porous g-C3N4 material with heterogeneous structural defects, oxygen atom replacing edge nitrogen and cyano group, obtained via a facile treatment method. The reconstructed material shows narrowing band gap, high light absorption and fast charge separation. Theoretical calculation discloses that the doped oxygen atom and the nearby atoms accept electrons as reduction site to produce hydrogen, while the undoped fraction and cyano group take the duty to oxidize water. The delocalization of reactive sites drives charge shuttle on the plane, limiting recombination of charge carriers. Consequently, the modified g-C3N4 shows excellent photocatalytic activity with apparent quantum efficiency of 8.41% under 420 nm wavelength, surpassing pure g-C3N4 and other reported materials with defect compilation. We think that this work provides a new avenue to understand the function of structural defect on prompt charge separation."

The operations of industrial reactors are judiciously focused on the dynamics of the deactivation along the axial length of the reactors, which are generally known approximately. Processes of strong energy release or fast chemical kinetics, such as oxidation reactions, cracking, etc., are associated with a deactivation where the time characteristics of the flow and transports are of magnitudes of the deactivation time-on-stream. Local deactivation of the preferential oxidation of CO was investigated by three-dimensional modelling of flow, mass and heat transfers inside a packed-bed reactor and validated by near-infrared tomography. The profiles of deactivation were sensitive to the rates of deactivation, heat transfer by dispersion and intra-particle mass transfer. At pore scale of the packing, pronounced deactivation was revealed near the wall due to a preferential flow circulation. The deactivation progressed at the exteriors of the catalytic particles, particularly over the regions in contact with the convective flow. Unlike the mass dispersion, the heat dispersion promoted the deactivation by shifting the moving waves of deactivation upstream, leading to asymmetrical maps inside the catalytic particles."

All rights reserved.Recommendation of useful information is playing a fundamental role in discovering new experiences in our daily lives, and predicting a user's preferences is very significant in making services more intelligent. Additionally, due to informativeness and convenience, photos have great potential to include our thoughts, opinions, and feelings, and they seem to be suitable for extracting users' interests in realizing such intelligent services; however, even if we analyze a photo that can be used for extracting users' preferences, we cannot accurately determine that the user has an interest in an object in a photo. This study proposes a method for predicting a user's special feelings toward photos based on the user's behaviors of taking and editing photos. From our assumption, users spend considerable time taking and editing their photos when they have a special interest in an object that they are shooting. In addition, we apply our method to implement a photo sharing service to enhance people's communication by recommending photos to users that have similar behaviors. We confirm the feasibility of our proposed method by several experiments using our prototype."

All rights reserved.The significant computation in global environmental analysis is ""contextoriented semantic computing"" to interpret the meanings of natural phenomena occurring in the nature. Our semantic computing method realizes the semantic interpretation of natural phenomena and analyzes the changes of various environmental situations. It is important to realize global environmental computing methodology for analyzing difference and diversity of nature and livings in a context dependent way with a large amount of information resources in global environments. Semantic computations contribute to make ""appropriate and urgent solutions"" to the changes of environmental situations. It is also significant to memorize those situations and compute environment changes in various aspects and contexts, in order to discover what are happening in the nature of our planet. We have various (almost infinite) aspects and contexts in environmental changes, and it is essential to realize a new analyzer for computing the meanings of those situations and making solutions for discovering actual aspects and contexts. We propose a new method for semantic computing in our Multi-dimensional World map. We utilize a multi-dimensional computing model, the Mathematical Model of Meaning (MMM) [1-3], and a multi-dimensional space with an adaptive axis adjustment mechanism. In semantic computing for environmental changes in multi-aspects and contexts, we present important functional pillars for analyzing natural environment situations. We also present a method to analyze and visualize the highlighted pillars using our Multi-dimensional World Map (5-Dimensional World Map) System. We introduce the concept of ""SPA (Sensing, Processing and Analytical Actuation Functions)"" for realizing a global environmental system, to apply it to Multi-dimensional World Map System. This concept is essential to design environmental systems with Physical-Cyber integration to detect environmental phenomena in a physical-space (real space), map them to cyber-space to make analytical and semantic computing, and actuate the analytically computed results to the real space with visualization for expressing environmental phenomena, causalities and influences. This system currently realizes the integration and semantic-analysis for KEIO-MDBL-UN-ESCAP Joint system for global oceanwater analysis with image databases.

The production of α-farnesene was found to be enhanced in strains with a low translation initiation rate, resulting in α-farnesene production (0.57 mg/(L day)). Using the RBS variants and random mutations, we performed fluorescence-based analysis of cells grown in 96-well culture plates to screen the α-farnesene-producing strains but could not improve the titers of the RBS-optimized strains. However, evolutionary engineering of the RBS-optimized strains resulted in a twofold increase in α-farnesene production (1.2 mg/(L day)) compared to the previous study. Therefore, combining metabolic and evolutionary engineering might be helpful for enhancing the cellular fitness of cyanobacteria for the production of target chemicals."

It offers a compact mode of natural gas storage with high degree of safety. In this work, we present the synergistic effects of tetrahydrofuran (THF), hollow silica (HS), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in enhancing the kinetics of mixed methane-THF hydrate formation at 6 MPa and 293.2 K in an unstirred reactor configuration. HS at the low loading of 0.5% w HS/v in 5.56 mol % THF solution used in the current study is an innovative approach to improve the surface contact area resulting in kinetic enhancement at moderate conditions (low driving force). However, the mixture of 0.5% w HS/v in 5.56 mol % THF solution resulted in a long induction time (about 400 min), which is not favorable for the SNG technology. Addition of SDS decreased the induction time and increased the hydrate formation rate under similar experimental conditions. The induction time significantly decreased with the increase in the SDS concentration. Additionally, the presence of SDS played a key role in influencing the temperature profile and the hydrate morphology during mixed hydrate formation. The methane gas uptake was 0.0591 (±0.0007) and 0.0615 (±0.0023) mol of methane/mol of water without and with SDS, respectively. Thermal stimulation with ΔT = 15 K was employed to recover methane from hydrates. A recovery of 96-98% of the stored methane gas from the hydrates formed with and without SDS was demonstrated. Interestingly, the presence of HS was effective in preventing the foam generation during hydrate dissociation in the presence of SDS."

Nanofibrous adsorbents are potential materials for such application with most attempts made on carbon nanofibers. In this study, a series of electrospun nanofibrous adsorbents containing amines were prepared using a 3-stage promising approach and tested comparatively for CO2 capture. The preparation of adsorbents involved electrospinning of syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) solution, radiation-induced grafting (RIG) of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) onto electrospun nanofibers, and functionalization of poly-GMA grafted s-PP nanofibrous mats with different amines, including ethanolamine (EA) diethylamine (DEA) and triethylamine (TEA). The effect of different amination parameters: namely, amine concentration, reaction time, temperature, and degree of grafting (DG) on the degree of amination (DA), was evaluated. The nanofibrous mats containing amine were tested for CO2 adsorption in a fixed bed column operated under various parameters such as amine density, amine type, initial CO2 concentration and temperature. The adsorbents recorded CO2 adsorption capacities of 2.87, 2.06, and 0.94 mmol/g for EA-, DEA- and TEA-containing adsorbents, respectively, at 30°C using initial CO2 concentration of 15%. This was coupled with the same order of high amine efficiency of 75, 57, and 31%.

The significant similarities between three specific members of this class, K3H(SeO4)2, Rb3H(SeO4)2, and Cs3H(SeO4)2, render the pseudobinary systems between end-members ideal for an exploration of the crystal chemical features that drive the superprotonic transition and control the magnitude of the conductivity. Accordingly, a systematic study of the (KxRb1-x)3H(SeO4)2 and (CsxRb1-x)3H(SeO4)2 systems is carried out here using in situ high-temperature diffraction and conductivity measurements by ac impedance spectroscopy. Across the entire composition range, a transition to a superprotonic phase of the space group R3̄ m is observed. With decreasing average size of the alkali cation, the superprotonic transition temperature generally decreases and, for a given temperature, the conductivity monotonically increases. The variation in transition temperature with composition is discussed in terms of possible strain effects on the internal energy of the monoclinic phase. The conductivity in the superprotonic phase is found to obey the phenomenological compensation rule, in which the logarithm of the pre-exponential term is linearly correlated with the activation energy. The decrease in activation energy for proton transport with decreasing average cation size is tentatively ascribed to a contraction in the length of the hydrogen bonds, presumed from the contraction of the cell volume. Subtle changes in structure and conductivity occur at the special composition Cs2RbH(SeO4)2, corresponding to a structure in which Cs and Rb species could be fully unmixed over available cation sites. While a fully ordered arrangement of cations was not observed, the larger cation was found to preferentially occupy the larger of the two cation sites in both high- and low-temperature phases and in both chemical systems."

The measurements are based on data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The yield of primary charged hadrons produced in xenon-xenon collisions in the pseudorapidity range |η|<3.2 is determined using the silicon pixel detector in the CMS tracking system. For the 5% most central collisions, the charged-hadron pseudorapidity density in the midrapidity region |η|<0.5 is found to be 1187±36 (syst), with a negligible statistical uncertainty. The rapidity distribution of charged hadrons is also presented in the range |y|<3.2 and is found to be independent of rapidity around y=0. Existing Monte-Carlo event generators are unable to simultaneously describe both results. Comparisons of charged-hadron multiplicities between xenon-xenon and lead-lead collisions at similar collision energies show that particle production at midrapidity is strongly dependent on the collision geometry in addition to the system size and collision energy."

Efficiency of problem handling is very important to software companies to maintain customer satisfaction. This paper reports a case of a software company in Thailand whose derivatives trading software is used by a large number of broker companies and their customers. The software company has experienced problems where the reported software problems are classified incorrectly and hence are directed to the wrong persons and have to be reclassified. Assigning the problem reports to the responsible persons in a timely and correct manner is crucial especially for the nature of the trading software.

The attractive characteristics of agile development are that it embraces frequent changes and that it gives high priority to users. Due to such characteristics, non-functional requirements are usually not identified in the requirements elicitation process. They are often neglected in an early phase, and even overlooked in the later stages of software development. This results in poor quality software. To enhance non-functional requirements identification in agile development, this paper proposes a development of a set of non-functional requirement patterns in the form of requirement templates for agile development. The set is composed of 10 security requirement patterns and 13 fault tolerance requirement patterns, which are derived from an analysis of security and fault tolerance design patterns. The proposed non-functional requirement patterns can facilitate non-functional requirements gathering and help agile team members in writing the requirements. In an experiment on a Scrum team, the team members took less time to write security and fault tolerance requirements for a number of given problems when using the proposed patterns, compared with the case of not using the patterns. In addition, the non-functional requirement patterns helped the team members to write more complete security and fault tolerance requirements. Despite the effort they had to spend in learning the proposed requirement patterns, the team also agreed that the patterns are useful in practice."

However, as the business process continue to develop iteratively, the business rules are likely to explode considerably. This usually leads to an inadvertently error-prone design of the business process. Therefore, some designers employ a visualization technique to help them comprehend the decision tables more profoundly and mitigate the design errors. This paper proposes a scheme to visualize the decision tables using Petri nets. A Petri net is a formal method that is used to illustrate business flows and decision paths of the decision table. Our method starts with defining a set of rules which transforms a decision table into a Petri net model. Next, the table is transformed into a Petri net model. This transforming process often disclose inconsistent rules and redundant rules. After refining the table and obtaining a final model, a simulation tool is then used to animate the Petri net model. This allows the designers to verify the internal working of the decision table, identify its flaws, and fix the errors more precisely."

Currently, business processes are becoming more complex with increasing conditions. As a result, it is highly difficult to manage activities and decision-making in business processes. However, BPMN still cannot handle the decision-making in business processes. Object management group (OMG) created Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to complement BPMN and to manage the decision-making of business processes. In software development process, creating a business process model can occur earlier during requirement gathering. However, a tester can generate test cases to verify accuracy of information in the business process. Previously, many researchers have focused on BPMN test cases generation. None of their studies has been conducted on the creation of BPMN test cases with DMN. Consequently, this paper proposes an approach to generate test cases from BPMN with DMN. BPMN along with DMN, paths traverse from the entry to the exit of the BPMN, and existing test cases are inputs of our approach. BPMN, DMN, and existing test cases are analyzed to check whether they cover all rules in the DMN. In case that all rules are not covered, new test cases will be generated. This paper proposes an approach to generate test cases cover all rules in the DMN to effective monitoring BPMN with DMN. This approach is used to check the rules within the DMN decision table without affecting BPMN process. It ensures the business processes are implemented correctly."

Using erroneous data such as data with missing values, class imbalance, and skew, may affect model performance and classification outcome. Often when models have poor performance, practitioners focus on improving models but overlook quality processing as it requires the involvement of data experts or data owners who have an intimate understanding of the data. Furthermore, performing data quality processing is challenging in that there is no one-size-fits-all optimal solution that is suitable for all types of data and models. Therefore, a unique combination of data quality processing methods is required for each dataset and model prior to model generation in order to identify the most appropriate set of methods that can improve the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Finding the most effective way to prepare data requires many manual iterations of trial and error. In this paper, we design and develop Sweeper, a tool that automatically explores combinations of many data quality processing methods and models to rank and identify the most suitable one for the given data. Sweeper is simple to use and can reduce the manual workload for practitioners in improving data classification performance."

This paper is shown that the dynamic parameters in the traction controller can be negligible in some cases, internal sensor state variables and gain parameters are enough to retain some traction controllability. The controller is derived from the model following control method (MFC) on a discrete domain. Experiments are performed, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the simplified controller using a two-wheeled mobile robot, by comparing slippage between the position and velocity control scheme with and without the traction control scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed traction control scheme is able to suppress the slip and very simple to implement."

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of National Institute of Clean-and-Low-Carbon Energy.Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized by the chemical vapour deposition of methane and carbon dioxide over a Ni/MgO catalyst. The synthesized CNTs were then mixed with K/MgO catalyst at different ratios and used as the catalyst for CO2 absorption in butylethanolamine-2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol bi-solvent blend. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, butylethanolamine, thermal gravimetric analysis and temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide in order to determine the characteristics responsible for good CO2-absorption performance. The results showed that, with the addition of a catalyst into the amine solution, the amine reached equilibrium CO2 loading faster than without a catalyst. Also, the increase in the CNT content of the KMgO/CNTs catalyst made the CO2 absorption reach equilibrium much more quickly compared with just KMgO alone and without a catalyst. The KMgO/CNTs at a ratio of 1:4 yielded the fastest time to reach CO2-loading equilibrium at 240 min, which was mainly due to the increase in strong basic sites as well as the highest total basic sites with an increase in CNT content. In addition, because of the extremely large specific surface area and pore volume generated due to the CNT, the number of exposed active centres per unit mass increased tremendously, leading to a corresponding tremendous increase in CO2 absorption."

The simulation of first and second dimension time (1tR and 2tR) of FAME relies on use of a Gibbs energy additivity approach to correlate with the structures of FAME. First and second dimension peak standard deviations (1σ and 2σ) of the compounds were further calculated from the 1tR and 2tR data according to the plate height concept which provided good agreement between the predicted and experimental peak widths at half height in one dimension GC (1DGC) with an overall R2 of 0.9628. The effect of 1σ distortion caused by the modulation process was also taken into account in the peak width simulation where the simulated 1σ data were rounded up to multiples of the scale of modulation period (PM). Two dimension Gaussian equations were then used to generate GC × GC results (2D contour plots) from simulated 1tR, 2tR, 1σ and 2σ data for FAME separation on different column sets employing ionic liquid and conventional columns. Good overall correlations between experimental and simulated 1tR and 2tR were obtained with R2 of 0.9951 and 0.9802, respectively, and the simulated 2D contour plots were an acceptable match with the experimental results."

When we initiated this study with nilotinib, imatinib was the only tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph1) CML in chronic phase (CP); alternative treatment options were needed, particularly for patients who developed resistance or intolerance (R/I) to imatinib. This phase 2 study enrolled pediatric patients with either Ph1 CML-CP R/I to imatinib or dasatinib or newly diagnosed Ph1 CML-CP. Data presented are from analyses with minimum follow-up of up to 24 cycles (1 cycle is 28 days). Fifty-nine patients with Ph1 CML-CP were enrolled, and 58 were treated (R/I, n 5 33; newly diagnosed, n 5 25). Major molecular response (MMR) rate at cycle 6 in the R/I cohort was 39.4% (primary end point); 57.6% of patients achieved or maintained MMR and 81.8% achieved or maintained complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 24 cycles. In patients with newly diagnosed disease, rates of MMR by cycle 12 and CCyR at cycle 12 were 64.0% each (primary end points); by cycle 24, cumulative MMR and CCyR rates were 68.0% and 84.0%, respectively. The safety profile of nilotinib in pediatric patients was generally comparable with the known safety profile in adults, although cardiovascular events were not observed in this study, and hepatic laboratory abnormalities were more frequent; no new safety signals were identified.

HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) is an essential enzyme for the HIV replication, and therefore, it is an important target for antiretroviral drugs development, particularly from natural products. Auricularia polytricha (AP) is an edible mushroom with several important therapeutic properties. These properties will be investigated as HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Methods: The sequential hexane (APH), ethanol (APE) and water (APW) extracts from AP were screened for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 PR. The extract that consistently showed the strong HIV-1 PR inhibition was further investigated for its phytochemical constituents. The compounds were purified by column chromatography. The isolated compounds were structurally elucidated using 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, FTIR, and GC/MS techniques. Each compound was screened against HIV-1 PR to determine its inhibitory activity and to provide an explanation for the activity found in the extract. Results: Hexane crude extract of AP (APH) exhibited significant inhibition on HIV-1 PR activity. Four major compounds isolated from APH fraction were identified to be two triacylglycerols, linoleic acid and ergosterol. Moreover, all four compounds showed significant inhibition of HIV-1 PR activity. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggest that AP is a good source of fatty esters, fatty acids and ergosterol. These natural products exhibit anti-HIV-1 properties by blocking HIV-1 PR. These important biological results warrant further development of AP as an alternative antiretroviral drug."

The rheology measurement was made at frequency of 0.1 to 10 Hz and 1 % strain at 25 °C. The storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G') and complex viscosity (η∗) were determined to know the viscoelastic behavior of the film solution. The magnitude of G' was greater than G' for all samples which indicated that the film solution was a gel-like; that is, the film solution behaves more like a solid where the deformations were elastic and recoverable. All samples show increasing trend of G' and G' as the frequency increased. The complex viscosity decreased with increasing frequency which presented a shear thinning behavior of the film solution. The dynamic rheological properties of cassava starch-kaffir lime oil film solution was determined appropriately, thus the characterization of produced biopolymer film by casting can be correlated."

The search considers the case where the resonance has high transverse momentum due to initial-state radiation of a hard photon. To study this process, the decay products of the resonance are reconstructed as a single large-radius jet with two-pronged substructure. The signal would be identified as a localized excess in the jet invariant mass spectrum. No evidence for such a resonance is observed in the mass range 10 to 125 GeV. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the coupling strength of resonances decaying to quark pairs. The results obtained with this photon trigger strategy provide the first direct constraints on quark-antiquark resonance masses below 50 GeV obtained at a hadron collider."

This task is considered to pertain to fundamental knowledge in applied microbiology. Some previous investigations conducted the study by applying feature-based models; others have presented deep-learning-based models such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks used with the shortest dependency paths (SDPs). Although SDPs contain valuable and concise information, some parts of crucial information that is required to define bacterial location relationships are often neglected. Moreover, the traditional word-embedding used in previous studies may suffer from word ambiguation across linguistic contexts. Results: Here, we present a deep learning model for biomedical RE. The model incorporates feature combinations of SDPs and full sentences with various attention mechanisms. We also used pre-trained contextual representations based on domain-specific vocabularies. To assess the model's robustness, we introduced a mean F1 score on many models using different random seeds. The experiments were conducted on the standard BB corpus in BioNLP-ST'16. Our experimental results revealed that the model performed better (in terms of both maximum and average F1 scores; 60.77% and 57.63%, respectively) compared with other existing models.

However, there was no such study in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to evaluate cost-effectiveness and budget impact of CRC screening modalities for average-risk persons in Thailand. Methods: A decision tree coupled with a Markov model was used to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits of fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and colonoscopy using a societal perspective. The input parameters were obtained from a CRC screening project at a Thai tertiary care hospital, Thai health care costs and databases, and systematic literature review. Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2017 US Dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty. Finally, budget impact analysis was conducted. Results: At the Thai ceiling threshold of societal willingness-to-pay of 4,706 USD, the screening colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT, starting at age 50, was cost-effective, as compared to no screening resulting in 15.09 and 15.00 QALYs with the ICERs of 600.20 and 509.84 USD/QALY gained, respectively. Colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT could prevent 17.9% and 5.7% of early stage cancer and 27.8% and 9.2% of late stage cancer per 100,000 screening over lifetime when compared to no screening, respectively. The colonoscopy screening was cost-effective with the ICER of 646.53 USD/QALY gained when compared to FIT. The probabilities of being cost-effective for the colonoscopy and FIT were 75% and 25%, respectively. Budget impact analysis showed the colonoscopy screening required an 8-times higher budget than FIT. Conclusions: Colonoscopy offers the best value for money of CRC screenings in Thailand. Annual FIT is potentially feasible since it requires less resources. Our findings can be used as part of evidence for informing policy decision making.Key points for decision makers There was a lack of cost-effective study of colorectal cancer screening programs in low- and middle-income countries. This study evaluated lifetime health outcomes and costs, and the cost-effectiveness of colorectal screening options for average-risk persons in Thailand. Colonoscopy screening every 10 years is cost-effective with high probability of being cost-effective as compared with annual fecal immunochemical test. Screening by annual fecal immunochemical test is more feasible in terms of human resource and budgetary burden. Colorectal screening programs provides an opportunity for early diagnosis and treatments to prevent advance colorectal stages and avoid higher consequent costs.

The association between the VRZ concentration and clinical outcome was then determined. Results: A total of 81 patients were included in this study. Forty (49.4%) patients were male, with median age of 56.1 years. Sixty of them had hematologic malignancies. Forty-seven patients were diagnosed with probable IA. Median blood sampling time for VRZ level measurement was 11.5 h after the last dose administration on day 9. The median duration of treatment and outcome evaluation was 103 days and 73 days, respectively. Overall success and mortality rate were 76.5% and 14.8%, respectively. In the treatment success group, we found the success rate of around 90% with VRZ trough concentration (Ctr) of 3-4 mg/L. Eleven patients developed liver injuries (LI) and the rate of LI increased significantly with VRZ Ctr of more than 5 mg/L. Conclusion: We recommend VRZ trough concentration of 3-4 mg/L, as at this range the patients responded better to the treatment than at > 5.0 mg/L since it was associated with augmented hepatotoxicity."

However, in case of critical and emergency situations, active braking (AB) performs better in improving handling improvement. To improve overall handling performance in the critical situation, combination of TV and AB is introduced in this paper. Yaw rate and vehicle sideslip rate are used as a control parameter in PID controller to determine motor torques and brake pressures. Brake force is applied at each wheel whenever motor brake torque is activated. With the contribution of AB, overall required motor torques for countering yaw moment are drastically reduced in four-wheel independent drive electric vehicle while similar stability performance can be achieved."
['Medicine (all)'],"Plasmapheresis reduces mycophenolic acid concentration: A study of full AUC0–12 in kidney transplant recipients  2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: Mycophenolic acid (MPA), a crucial immunosuppressive drug, and plasmapheresis, an effective immunoreduction method, are simultaneously used for the management of various immune-related diseases, including kidney transplantation. While plasmapheresis has been proven efficient in removing many substances from the blood, its effect on MPA plasma levels remains unestablished. Objectives: To evaluate the full pharmacokinetics of MPA by measuring the area under the time–concentration curve (AUC0–12), which is the best indicator for MPA treatment monitoring after each plasmapheresis session, and to compare the AUC0–12 measurements on the day with and on the day without plasmapheresis. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in kidney transplantation recipients who were taking a twice-daily oral dose of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, Cellcept®) and undergoing plasmapheresis at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, during January 2018 and January 2019. The MPA levels were measured by an enzymatic method (Roche diagnostic®) 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after MMF administration, for AUC0–12 calculation on the day with and on the day without plasmapheresis sessions. Plasmapheresis was started within 4 h after administering the oral morning dose of MMF. Our primary outcome was the difference of AUC0–12 between the day with and the day without plasmapheresis. Results: Forty complete AUC measurements included 20 measurements on the plasmapheresis day and other 20 measurements on the day without plasmapheresis in six kidney transplant patients. The mean age of the patients was 56.2 ± 20.7 years. All patients had received 1000 mg/day of MMF for at least 72 h before undergoing 3.5 ± 1.2 plasmapheresis sessions. The mean AUC on the day with plasmapheresis was lower than that on the day without plasmapheresis (28.22 ± 8.21 vs. 36.79 ± 10.29 mg × h/L, p = 0.001), and the percentage of AUC reduction was 19.49 ± 24.83%. This was mainly the result of a decrease in AUC0–4 of MPA (23.96 ± 28.12% reduction). Conclusions: Plasmapheresis significantly reduces the level of full AUC0–12 of MPA. The present study is the first to measure the full AUC0–12 in MPA-treated patients undergoing plasmapheresis. Our study suggests that a supplementary dose of MPA is necessary for patients undergoing plasmapheresis."

All rights reserved.Rank-size distributions of local government debt, regardless of the way in which data is categorized, whether by region, type, or all local governments, are found not to be normally distributed but rather consistent with a mathematical principle known as power law. This implies that local government borrowing resembles a complex adaptive system in the sense that it is self-organized with positive feedback among concerned parties. In such a system, a critical point could be reached wherein a local government debt crisis eventually disrupts a government s fiscal and financial status as well as that country s economic system. This kind of event is extremely difficult to predict in advance because it represents both an emergent phenomenon and scale-invariance. One cannot really tell beforehand what type or size of local government debt will transpire, or which local government would cause such a crisis. Therefore, rules and regulations designed to regulate and monitor local government borrowing, as well as manage the risk of local government debt, should emphasize mitigation measures in addition to disciplinary procedures. This study proposes a rule that requires each local government to maintain enough reserves to service its debts. The rationale is that, in the event of a local government debt crisis, the local government, indirectly affected by such a crisis, may encounter problems from liquidity shortage and therefore not be able to pay principals and/or interest to its creditors. Having such mitigation measures in place should not only lower the probability of local governments defaulting on debts, but also help build trust in the system."

Its current demand fluctuates largely due to the fast growing nature of business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) in Thailand. The company confronts a continuously increased amount of delayed deliveries resulting from the rising demand and insufficient existing resources. Opening more depots in high demand areas did not improve overall productivity for the company. One of the causes is the inappropriate allocation of postal codes for each depot. Some depots cannot handle the delivery demand while other depots are over capacitated. Re-clustering postal code allocations and determining proper number of vehicles deem necessary. The first phase of this work is to re-cluster postal code allocation using existing demand points to prove that the proposed cluster outperforms with the metric in percentage of delayed volumes. Unlike well-established companies, short term future demand for this company keeps changing; thus, future demand forecast is necessary and in this case ARIMA models are appropriate. This demand volume is the basis to determine appropriate number of vehicles coping with increasing demand. The result shows that applying this work slightly decreases the average percentage of mismatch from 15.76% to 14.73%. However, the percentages of mismatch of demand and depot capacity in all depots comply with the 30% constraint and the percentage of delayed volume complies with the 5% constraint."

Early diagnosis is required for proper patient management and reducing leptospirosis morbidity and mortality. To summarize current literature regarding commonly used and new promising molecular approaches to Leptospira detection and diagnostic tests of human leptospirosis. The relevant articles in Leptospira and leptospirosis were retrieved from MEDLINE (PubMed) and Scopus. Several molecular techniques have been developed for diagnosis of human leptospirosis. Polymerase chain reaction-based techniques targeting on either lipL32 or 16S rRNA (rrs) gene are most commonly used to detect leptospiral DNA in various clinical specimens. Whole blood and urine are recommended specimens for suspected cases in the first (acute) and the second (immune) phases, respectively. Isothermal amplification with less expensive instrument is an alternative DNA detection technique that may be suitable for resource-limited laboratories. Detection of leptospiral DNA in clinical specimens using molecular techniques enhances sensitivity for diagnosis of leptospirosis. The efficient and robust molecular detection especially in the early leptospiremic phase may prompt early and appropriate treatment leading to reduced morbidity and mortality of patients with leptospirosis."

All rights reserved.The underlying mechanism of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causing reproductive failure and re-circulation in herds has remained unclear. Endometrial cells primarily infected with PRRSV may serve as a significant target for PRRSV eradication. Primary endometrial (PE) cells from the porcine uterus were isolated and cultivated to pursue this possibility. Immunocytochemistry analysis revealed the protein expression of classical estrogen receptors (ER-α and ER-β), but not PRRSV receptors, CD163 and sialoadhesin in PE cells. PE cells were apically/basolaterally inoculated with PRRSV type I/type II isolated from PRRSV infected lungs or mock infection. Cytopathic effects (CPE) and PRRSV-GP5 positive cells were detected in PE cells incubated with PRRSV inoculum (107 TCID50/ml) beginning at 4 days post inoculation (dpi). Only apical inoculation produced effects, suggesting route dependence of PRRSV infectivity in PE cells (p<0.05). PRRSV type II produced overall effects i.e., CPE, PRRSV-GP5 positive cells and a viral load higher than type I (p<0.05) during 2-6 dpi. In accordance with these effects, the tissue epithelial resistance (TER) of type II inoculated PE cells was lower than that of mock or type I inoculated cells (p<0.05). In addition, all the PE cells and media samples collected from PRRSV-inoculated PE cells persistently revealed PRRSVGP5 protein and viral copies (102-108 TCID50/ml) accessed by infecting MARC-145 cells. These findings provided the first evidence that PE cells can be directly infected with PRRSV, favorably by type II at the apical side. However, all PRRSV contaminated PE cells persistently carry the progeny virus."

All rights reserved.Competitive exclusion (CE) relies on the activity of normal flora to limit intestinal colonization by enteric pathogens. This study aims to investigate the effects of CE on Salmonella infection in broilers. The protective effect of CE on Salmonella cecal colonization was evaluated in 1 day-old chicks. In the laboratory trial, CE products were administered by oral inoculation, drinking water and whole body spray. Three days after treatment, the chickens were challenged with 107cfu/mL of Salmonella Enteritidis orally, and were evaluated for 10 days. The CE-treated chickens showed comparable protection and the number of Salmonella in the cecal contents significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) compared with those of the positive control. In the farm trial, CE was administered by whole body spray at the hatchery and the second was administered by drinking water and evaluated at 32 and 42 days, respectively. The CE significantly reduced Salmonella contamination in the farm trial and no Salmonella was detected in the cecal contents compared with the control group. Average body weight gains, feed conversion ratio and the performance index of the chickens were greater than the control group. Thus, the use of CE had a positive effect on broiler performance. Furthermore, the CE-treated chickens displayed greater intestinal histology including villous height, submuscular layer and cell mitosis. These studies demonstrate that CE was able to protect chickens from Salmonella cecal colonization and it is apparent that new methodologies associated with the development of a workable CE program are needed in the poultry industry."

All rights reserved.Although the major dog population in Thailand is the Thai native dog, its anatomy has rarely been studied. This study aimed to investigate anatomical variations of the canine coeliac trunk (CT) in Thailand by observing 62 cadavers including 46 Thai native dogs and 16 non-Thai native dogs. All cadavers were preserved in formalin solution, and the arteries were illustrated by injection of red coloured latex. Variations of CT were initially classified into 2 main types and 7 subtypes (type 1a-e and 2a-b) based on the previous reports. Type 1 was described as CT separated from the cranial mesenteric artery (CMA) while type 2, CT fused with CMA and called the coeliacomesenteric trunk (CMT). In this study, only 5 of 7 patterns were found (1a-c and 2a), but a new variation was identified as type 2c. The common patterns were type 1a (CT bifurcated into the gastrosplenic and hepatic arteries; 53.2%) and type 1b (CT trifurcated into the hepatic, left gastric and splenic arteries; 40.3%). The CMT was observed only at 3.2% while two types (1d-e) were not observed in this study. The male and female were different in the most common patterns (1b and 1a, respectively). Thai native dogs showed similar result to all dog results. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study concerning anatomical variations of the canine coeliac trunk of dogs in Thailand. This study is useful for facilitating imaging diagnosis and surgical treatment and also provides important knowledge for understanding the pathogenesis of the coeliac trunk related diseases."

Although MSG is considered safe at the consumption level, its adverse effects have been reported. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of MSG on the brain, liver, kidney, testes, and ovaries of zebrafish (Danio rerio) which were chronically exposed to MSG from the embryo stage to the adult stage. Additionally, the fertilization rate and hatching rate of zebrafish embryos were also analyzed. Zebrafish were randomly divided into four groups and treated with MSG at 0, 10, 100 and 1,000 mg/l, respectively for 60 days. Before sacrifice for histopathological study, the fishes in each group were mated and the embryos were collected and analyzed for the numbers, survival rate and hatching rate. The results showed that the liver and kidneys of fishes in the MSG-exposed groups had a significantly higher lesion score (P<0.05) compared to the control group. All fish from the MSG-exposed groups had diffuse hepatocyte swelling and hepatic congestion. Renal congestion and a decrease in the number of distal convoluted tubules were observed. Zebrafish from the 1,000 mg/l MSG-exposed group did not spawn after placing them in the mating tank. The number of embryos from the 100 mg/l MSG-exposed group was lower than the 10 mg/l MSG-exposed group and the control group. The survival rate of fertilized embryos (after 120 hours) from the 100 mg/l MSG-treated group was significantly lower than the control group. In summary, the results from this study showed that exposure to MSG for 60 days induced lesions to the liver and the kidneys and decreased the reproductive performance of zebrafish."

By focusing on residential scale of rooftop PVs, BESS has been developed and applied in many aspects especially in terms of electricity charge saving. Many papers propose the methodology to control the operation of BESS, while many papers propose the methodology to determine the battery capacity. As for this paper, the proposed methodology will simultaneously determine the operation schedule and battery capacity of BESS for rooftop PVs under a net-metering scheme (NMS). The main objective is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of the prosumers. The battery capacity will be constrained by the period of the NMS compensation which will be effective for only one year of each electricity bill. The numerical results show that, for the TOU tariff structure without demand charge, an appropriate BESS should have CNOM, DC as high as possible to increase the revenue from BESS and have PNOM, DC as low as possible to reduce the total investment cost (TTC). Also, by considering the limit period of the NMS compensation, an appropriate battery capacity should not be higher than monthly residential load consumption. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis of electricity tariff shows that the NPV will increase proportionally by the increment of electricity price, which will reduce the break-even year of the investment."

The reactors were made from 200L PE plastic bioreactors. There were 5 different bioreactors, each with a different vent volume. (These were 0%, 2.3%, 3%, 4.3% and 5.7% of bioreactor volume or 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 PVC pipes of diameter 1¼"", respectively. Each reactor also had a drain. The material to be composted was food scraps ground to a size less than 1.5 cm and mixed with rice husk, ash and saw dust at a ratio of 6: 1: 1 to achieve a C / N ratio of 35: 1. The Intermittently-Fed Composting (FIC) method was used, adding 4.5 kilograms of materials per day until 85 kg was added in total. The experiment was also subdivided into 2 types: bioreactors with added microbes (added-PD2); and those without added microbes (non-PD2). The experiment had a 60-day biodegradation period. Measurements of temperature, moisture content, and pH were taken and compost samples were analyzed for their germination index (GI) and quality, compared with Thailand compost standards. The results showed that the optimum air volume for composting was 3% of bioreactor volume, or 2 pipes. The composting time was 19 days with the highest temperature of 57-58°C and the temperature was held constant for 33 days. The organic waste decomposition and curing took a total of 57 days, with a GI value between 79-81% and the quality of the resulting fertilizer complied with standards. The main minerals in the compost were N, P and K, which were 1.25%-1.32%, 0.69%-0.76% and 0.93%-1.88%, respectively. It is concluded that different ventilation ratios affect the results for the decomposition of organic matter, with optimal ventilation being 3.0% of bioreactor volume or 2 pipes. There was a statistically significant difference between the results for compost with and without the addition of PD2."

However, single cell analysis (SCA) has been used as a practical means to overcome this drawback. Many contemporary methodologies are available for single cell analysis; among these, microfluidics is the most attractive and effective technology, due to its advantages of low-volume specimen consumption, label-free evaluation, and real-time monitoring, among others. In this paper, a conceptual application for microfluidic single cell analysis for veterinary research is presented. A microfluidic device is fabricated with an elastomer substrate, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), under standard soft lithography. The performance of the microdevice is high-throughput, sensitive, and user-friendly. A total of 53.1% of the triangular microwells were able to trap single canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (MCT) cells. Of these, 38.82% were single cell entrapments, while 14.34% were multiple cell entrapments. The ratio of single-to-multiple cell trapping was high, at 2.7:1. In addition, 80.5% of the trapped cells were viable, indicating that the system was non-lethal. OCT4A-immunofluorescence combined with the proposed system can assess OCT4A expression in trapped single cells more precisely than OCT4A-immunohistochemistry. Therefore, the results suggest that microfluidic single cell analysis could potentially reduce the impact of cellular heterogeneity."

All rights reserved..Background: East Asian, including Thailand, lung cancer population may have a relatively lower prevalence of KRAS mutations than Caucasians. We investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and the expression of cyclin D1, one of the KRAS downstream targets. Methods: Lung cancer patients who received treatment at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 2015 and July 2017 were enrolled. We identified KRAS mutations using allele specific PCR KRAS mutation testing. Cyclin D1 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry. Results: After excluding 376 EGFR mutations and inadequate samples, we enrolled 95 patients eligible for KRAS mutation testing. KRAS mutations were identified in 28 out of 95 patients. There were 26 patients with KRAS codon 12/13 and 2 patients with KRAS codon 61 mutations. The prevalence of KRAS mutations among informative samples was 28 out of 357 (7.8%) which was relatively lower than that reported in Caucasian population. Smoking and male were significantly associated with KRAS mutations. The prognosis of KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients in particular codon 61 mutations was worse than that found in KRAS- and EGFR-wild-type (KRAS WT/EGFR WT) NSCLC patients (P=0.048). The levels of cyclin D1 expression in KRAS-mutant NSCLC were significantly higher than those in KRAS WT/EGFR WT NSCLC (P=0.02). A better prognosis of KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients with low cyclin D1 expression was observed when compared with those with high cyclin D1 expression (median overall survival 41.7 vs. 3.5 months, P=0.037). Conclusions: We found a moderate prevalence of KRAS mutations in lung cancer in Thailand. Clinical characteristics were similar to those of Caucasian population. Most KRAS-mutant NSCLC had high cyclin D1 expression. Cyclin D1 expression may serve as a useful prognostic biomarker in KRAS-mutant lung cancer. Validation of this finding in larger cohort is required."

The purpose of this study is to provide evidence, reference and contribute to the knowledge about government spending and economic growth. This study involves ASEAN-5 countries. The countries are Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia. The countries are chosen because there is a lack of study of government expenditure for ASEAN-5 countries using panel data. The data covers from year 1990 to 2014. The data is retrieved from the World Development Indicators (World Bank). The dependent variable is gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is used to measure economic growth. The main independent variable is government expenditure. The other independent variables are gross capital formation, portfolio investment, labor, trade, total reserve and gross savings. A clear understanding about inter-linkages between government spending and economic growth will help the government in making better decision for the country. As ASEAN countries have responsibility for ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025 to meet its objectives, ASEAN governments are expected to effectively monitor the public spending as fiscal instrument in stimulating economic growth. Government expenditure may become unproductive if misallocating and using it in excess. From this study, there is evidence that government expenditure has impact on economic growth. Future research is expected to expand the investigation to other composition of government spending such as education, defense and infrastructure expenditures instead of using general government final consumption expenditures."
['Economics and Econometrics'],"CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION of ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING DEVICES and SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING of BANGKOKIANS  2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.Empirical evidence of the conspicuous consumption theory is limited and ambiguous. It has been shown, however, that the consumption of life experiences makes people happier than the consumption of material goods. Yet, these studies typically conduct dichotomous comparisons and do not distinguish between conspicuous and inconspicuous consumption. Conspicuous and inconspicuous online social networking devices (OSND) are experiential goods and as such fall between life experiences and material goods. The objective of this paper, thus, is to examine the relationship between conspicuous consumption of OSND and subjective well-being, which is proxied by happiness and mental health. Cross-sectional data (n=500) were collected in 2015 using probability sampling. The ordered logistic regression results reveal that conspicuous consumption of OSND is negatively related with happiness and mental health in all regressions as hypothesized, while the coefficient on inconspicuous consumption of OSND is positive. Also, the number of virtual friends is negatively associated with happiness. Among the control variables, it is noteworthy that respondents with high blood pressure, used to capture physical health, have lower happiness and mental health, while respondents with higher education and high own monthly income exhibit higher happiness and mental health. Respondents, whose personality can best be characterized as ""agreeable"", have lower happiness and mental health which is in line with the old saying that ""nice guys finish last""."

All rights reserved.The Lower Ping River downstream from the Bhumibol Dam has suffered from the excessive sedimentation. Rapid growth sandbars occur along the 129 km of the downstream reach within the succession of weirs. Severe riverbank collapses can also be detected locally. The objective of this research is to assess riverbank accretion/erosion using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Comparison of the 2007 and 2017 satellite images shows that total emerged island bar area increases up to 5,702,557 m2. The total riverbank erosion area is 1,150,943 m2 whereas the total of accretion area is over 10,561,530 m2. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software was used to determine the riverbank erosion/accretion rates. The DSAS output shows the average rate of erosion and accretion at 1.24 and 4.89 m/year. Rapid growth of sandbars is responsible for the shallowing and narrowing of river embankment leading to rapid overflow during flooding. The result from this study enables all authorities and stakeholders to recognize the specific locations, which have severely been affected by riverbank accretion and erosion."

This study aims to quantify roadside fine particulate matters (PM) in term of PM2.5 (diameter less than 2.5 μm) and PM10 (diameter less than 10 μm) in construction related areas and traffic congested areas. The eastern routes, Pattanakan and Srinagarindra, those are located between inbound and outbound junction were selected as the studied sites. PM2.5 was sampled using mini-volume air sampler, while PM10 was sampled using cyclone air sampler. The PM was collected for 12 hours/day, continued 5 days for each sites, during November to December 2018. Then the dust samples were extracted by acidified microwave digestion. Five heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS). The traffic conditions monitored from video-camera were found more crowded in construction related area than traffic related area. The average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in construction related area (39.38 μg/m3 and 55.08 μg/m3, respectively) were higher than the control area without construction (36.15 μg/m3 and 48.87 μg/m3, respectively). The lowest concentration was (17.28 μg/m3 and 27.32 μg/m3) for the background site. However, it is the matter of the benefit to provide convenience in the future after the construction, whether the environmental problems could be solved in the long terms.

Methods: Between October 2010 and September 2015, non-metastatic NPC patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Pretreatment images of 205 patients were reviewed by two radiologists to determine the TNM classification according to the seventh and eighth editions of the AJCC/UICC staging system. Overall survival (OS), progressionfree survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated. Harrell's C concordance index (C-index) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) were used to compare the staging models. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted and incorporated with plasma EBV DNA. Results: Overall, the eighth edition showed higher C-indexes and lower AIC values in nodal classification and stage groups, indicating a better discrimination performance and better goodness of fit, but showed similar separation for T classification compared with the seventh edition. The integration of pretreatment EBV values (<2300 vs =2300 copies/ml) to the eighth edition AJCC/UICC staging system allowed the classification of patients into three RPA categories and further lowered the AIC value and increased the C-index for OS. Conclusion: The eighth edition of the AJCC/UICC staging system had higher prognostic values in terms of OS, PFS and DMFS than the previous edition. An integration of pretreatment plasma EBV DNA into the next AJCC/UICC staging could improve the outcome prediction especially in poor risk groups who might benefit from treatment intensification."
['Multidisciplinary'],"A computational-experimental investigation on high ethylene selectivity in ethanol dehydration reaction found on WOx/ZrO2-activated carbon bi-support systems  2019, The Author(s).The high ethylene selectivity exhibited on the zirconia-activated-carbon bi-support catalyst is investigated by experiment and density functional theory–based (DFT) analysis. This bi-support catalyst systems prepared by the physical mixing method for the tungsten catalyst show a significant increase in ethylene selectivity up to 90% compared to the zirconia single support system (~58%) during the ethanol dehydration reaction. Besides, the optimal percent weight ratio of zirconia to activated carbon, which results in the highest ethanol conversion is 50:50. The DFT–based analysis is used to investigate high ethylene selectivity in the bi-support system. It shows that the WO5/zirconia is the most stable model for the zirconia single-support tungsten catalyst represented by the zirconia (101) facet of the tetrahedral phase. The carbon atoms were added to the WO5/zirconia to model the tungsten catalyst on the bi-support system. The Bader charge analysis is carried out to determine the electron transfer in the catalyst. The bonding between ethylene and the WO5 active site on the catalyst is weakened when the system is bi-support, where the added carbon atoms on the catalyst in the ZrO2 region decrease the ethylene adsorption energy. Thus, the desorption and the selectivity of ethylene are promoted. The decrease in adsorption energy can be explained via the analysis of the projected density of states (PDOS) profiles of atom involving the adsorption. It was found that the added carbon in the ZrO2 region induces the electron transfer from the ethylene molecule to the surface, especially to the ZrO2 region. The depletion of the electron around the ethylene molecule weakens the bonds, thus, promote desorption. Hence, the advantages of using the bi-support system in the tungsten catalyst are that the catalyst exhibit (1) high conversion due to the zirconia support and (2) high ethylene selectivity due to the added carbon promoting the desorption of ethylene via the induction of electron from an ethylene molecule to surface."

A multicenter cohort study was conducted in Thailand and Indonesia. Adolescents aged 10-25 years who were on antiretroviral treatment (ART), had virologic suppression (HIV RNA<400 copies/mL within the past 6 months), and had no history of chronic hepatitis B/C infection were enrolled. Participants were pre-classified into 2 subgroups (1:1 ratio) as participants with history of elevated versus normal aminotransferase enzymes. NAFLD was defined as hepatic steatosis (any severity) evaluated by liver ultrasonography. Significant hepatic fibrosis was defined as liver stiffness ≥7.4 kPa evaluated by transient elastography. Participants who met the criteria for protocol-defined NAFLD and/or hepatic fibrosis were re-assessed to evaluate disease progression (persistent versus transient hepatic abnormalities) at one year later. Of 120 participants, 62 (51.7%) were male, 7 (5.8%) had central obesity, and 19 (15.8%) had insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] <3.16). At enrollment, the median age and duration of ART (IQR) were 17.0 (14.6-19.2) years and 10.5 (7.1-12.0) years, respectively. Persistent hepatic abnormalities were identified in 5/60 participants listed in the group having history of elevated aminotransferases, corresponding to the prevalence of 8.3% (95% CI: 2.8-18.4%), whereas none (0/60) were among the group having history of normal hepatic enzymes. All 5 participants had persistent aminotransferase elevation (≥2 episodes within the past 12 months). Baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >30 U/L (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 29.1; 95% CI: 1.7-511.8), and HOMA-IR >3.16 (aOR: 17.9; 95% CI: 1.1-289.7) were independently associated with persistent hepatic abnormalities. Among perinatally HIV-monoinfected Asian adolescents with history of elevated aminotransferase enzymes, persistent hepatic abnormalities are not uncommon. Screening for liver complications by noninvasive diagnostic tools might be considered in at risk individuals, including those with persistent ALT elevation and insulin resistance."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lung cancer has long been recognized as an important world heath concern due to its high incidence and death rate. The failure of treatment strategies, as well as the regrowth of the disease driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs) residing in the tumor, lead to the urgent need for a novel CSC-targeting therapy. Here, we utilized proteome alteration analysis and ectopic tumor xenografts to gain insight on how gigantol, a bibenzyl compound from orchid species, could attenuate CSCs and reduce tumor integrity. The proteomics revealed that gigantol affected several functional proteins influencing the properties of CSCs, especially cell proliferation and survival. Importantly, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT related pathways were found to be suppressed by gigantol, while the JNK signal was enhanced. The in vivo nude mice model confirmed that pretreatment of the cells with gigantol prior to a tumor becoming established could decrease the cell division and tumor maintenance. The results indicated that gigantol decreased the relative tumor weight with dramatically reduced tumor cell proliferation, as indicated by Ki-67 labeling. Although gigantol only slightly altered the epithelial-to-mesenchymal and angiogenesis statuses, the gigantol-treated group showed a dramatic loss of tumor integrity as compared with the well-grown tumor mass of the untreated control. This study reveals the effects of gigantol on tumor initiation, growth, and maintain in the scope that the cells at the first step of tumor initiation have lesser CSC property than the control untreated cells. This study reveals novel insights into the anti-tumor mechanisms of gigantol focused on CSC targeting and destabilizing tumor integrity via suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways. This data supports the potential of gigantol to be further developed as a drug for lung cancer."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The synthesis of carbon nanoparticles (Cn) and oxygen-doped nanocarbon (OCn) was successfully done through a one-step synthesis by the solution plasma process (SPP). The Cn and OCn were nitrogen-doped by nitridation under an ammonia atmosphere at 800◦C for 2 h to yield NCn and NOCn, respectively, for carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption. The NOCn exhibited the highest specific surface area (~570 m2 g−1) and highest CO2 adsorption capacity (1.63 mmol g−1 at 25◦C) among the synthesized samples. The primary nitrogen species on the surface of NOCn were pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N. The synergistic effect of microporosity and nitrogen functionality on the NOCn surface played an essential role in CO2 adsorption enhancement. From the thermodynamic viewpoint, the CO2 adsorption on NOCn was physisorption, exothermic, and spontaneous. The NOCn showed a more negative enthalpy of adsorption, indicating its stronger interaction for CO2 on the surface, and hence, the higher adsorption capacity. The CO2 adsorption on NOCn over the whole pressure range at 25–55◦C best fitted the Toth model, suggesting monolayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface. In addition, NOCn expressed a higher selective CO2 adsorption than Cn and so was a good candidate for multicycle adsorption."

While it is evident that environmental and host genetic factors contribute in shaping the microbiome of mosquitoes, we have a poor under-standing regarding how bacterial genetics affects colonization of the mosquito gut. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system is a powerful tool to alter bacterial genomes facilitating investigations into host-microbe interactions but has yet to be applied to insect symbionts. Methodology/Principal findings To investigate the role of bacterial genetic factors in mosquito biology and in colonization of mosquitoes we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to mutate the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene of a Cedecea neteri symbiont isolated from Aedes mosquitoes. The ompA mutant had an impaired ability to form biofilms and poorly infected Ae. aegypti when reared in a mono-association under gnotobiotic conditions. In adult mosquitoes, the mutant had a significantly reduced infection prevalence compared to the wild type or complement strains, while no differences in prevalence were seen in larvae, suggesting genetic factors are particularly important for adult gut colonization. We also used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to integrate genes (antibiotic resistance and fluorescent markers) into the symbionts genome and demonstrated that these genes were functional in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions/Significance Our results shed insights into the role of ompA gene in host-microbe interactions in Ae. aegypti and confirm that CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can be employed for genetic manipulation of non-model gut microbes. The ability to use this technology for site-specific integration of genes into the symbiont will facilitate the development of paratransgenic control strategies to interfere with arboviral pathogens such Chikungunya, dengue, Zika and Yellow fever viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes."
['Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology'],"D-Lactic acid fermentation performance and the enzyme activity of a novel bacterium Terrilactibacillus laevilacticus SK5–6  2019, The Author(s).Purpose: The aim of this study was to prove that Terrilactibacillus laevilacticus SK5-6, a novel D-lactate producer, exhibited a good fermentation performance comparing to the reference D-lactate producer Sporolactobacillus sp. Methods: Glucose bioconversion for D-lactate production and the activity of five key enzymes including phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PYK), D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH), L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH), and lactate isomerase (LI) were investigated in the cultivation of T. laevilacticus SK5–6 and S. laevolacticus 0361T. Results: T. laevilacticus SK5–6 produced D-lactate at higher yield, productivity, and optical purity compared with S. laevolacticus 0361T. T. laevilacticus SK5–6, the catalase-positive isolate, simultaneously grew and produced D-lactate without lag phase while delayed growth and D-lactate production were observed in the culture of S. laevolacticus 0361T. The higher production of D-lactate in T. laevilacticus SK5–6 was due to the higher growth rate and the higher specific activities of the key enzymes observed at the early stage of the fermentation. The low isomerization activity was responsible for the high optical purity of D-lactate in the cultivation of T. laevilacticus SK5–6. Conclusion: The lowest specific activity of PFK following by PYK and D/L-LDHs, respectively, indicated that the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate was the rate limiting step. Under the well-optimized conditions, the activation of D/L-LDHs by fructose-1,6-phosphate and ATP regeneration by PYK drove glucose bioconversion toward D-lactate. The optical purity of D-lactate was controlled by D/L-LDHs and the activation of isomerases. High D-LDH with limited isomerase activity was preferable during the fermentation as it assured the high optical purity."

Materials and Methods: The participants, comprising third-grade students in Amphoe Meuang, Nakhonphanom province (N = 435), were randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 216) and a control group (n = 219). Baseline data of the students' oral health knowledge, attitudes, and plaque scores were collected at the beginning of the study. The experimental group was given oral health education sessions by trained schoolteachers using a specifically designed student handbook, while the control group did not receive extra oral health education other than the national curriculum. The immediate post-test knowledge was evaluated after each session, and plaque scores were determined after the brushing session. After the oral health education programme ended, the experimental and control groups performed a monthly toothbrushing activity for 2 months. Final assessment of the students' knowledge, attitudes, and plaque score was done at the 3-month follow-up. Results: The experimental group's oral health knowledge statistically significantly improved immediately after each session and was still statistically significant during the following three months. This improvement was also statistically significantly higher compared with the control group. The attitudes towards oral health care, foods related to caries, and dental visit improved. The plaque score of the experimental group was statistically significantly lower immediately post-brushing, but was not statistically significantly different at the 3-month follow-up compared with baseline. Conclusion: The children receiving oral health education provided by trained schoolteachers had statistically significantly greater oral health knowledge and more positive attitudes towards oral health than the children who had not received the programme. No statistically significant differences in plaque scores were found after 3 months."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Inductive molecules are critical components for successful bone tissue engineering. Dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1), a non-collagenous protein in the bone matrix, has been shown to play roles in osteogenic differentiation and phosphate homeostasis. This study aimed to produce recombinant human dentin matrix protein-1 (hDMP1) in Nicotiana benthamiana and investigated the ability of this plant-produced DMP1 to induce osteogenesis in human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). The hDMP1 gene was cloned into the geminiviral vector for transient expression in N. benthamiana. We found that hDMP1 was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves and could be purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by nickel affinity chromatography. The effects of hDMP1 on the induction of cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were investigated. The results indicated that plant-produced hDMP1 could induce the cell proliferation of hPDLSCs and increase the expression levels of osteogenic genes, including osterix (OSX), type I collagen (COL1), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), and Wnt3a. Moreover, the plant-produced hDMP1 promoted calcium deposition in hPDLSCs as determined by alizarin red S staining. In conclusion, our results indicated that plant-produced hDMP1 could induce osteogenic differentiation in hPDLSCs and could potentially be used as a bone inducer in bone tissue engineering."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the main causative agent of severe hand-foot-mouth disease. EV71 affects countries mainly in the Asia-Pacific region, which makes it unattractive for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs or vaccine to combat EV71 infection. However, development of these drugs and vaccines is vital to protect younger generations. This study aims to develop a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to EV71 using a plant platform, which is a cost-effective and scalable production technology. A previous report showed that D5, a murine anti-EV71 mAb, binds to VP1 protein of EV71, potently neutralizes EV71 in vitro, and effectively protects mice against EV71 infection. Herein, plant-produced chimeric D5 (cD5) mAb, variable regions of murine D5 antibody linked with constant regions of human IgG1, was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana using geminiviral vectors. The antibody was expressed at high levels within six days of infiltration. Plant-produced cD5 retained its in vitro high-affinity binding and neutralizing activity against EV71. Furthermore, a single dose (10 µg/g body weight) of plant-produced cD5 mAb offered 100% protection against infection in mice after a lethal EV71 challenge. Therefore, our results showed that plant-produced anti-EV71 mAb is an effective, safe, and affordable therapeutic option against EV71 infection."

All rights reserved.Background: Various pre- and perioperative risk factors have been reported in association with blood loss in knee arthroplasty. However, the effect of the uncovered cancellous surface on blood loss in simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SBTKA) by different prosthetic designs is not well elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the blood loss and transfusion rate between different knee prostheses in SBTKA and to identify risk factors that influence blood loss and transfusion after SBTKA. Methods: Demographic and perioperative data of patients who underwent SBTKA using either a closed-box or an open-box femoral component of posterior-stabilized fixed-bearing (PS FB) knee system were retrospectively reviewed. The calculated blood loss (CBL) and blood transfusion rate were compared by using Student t-test and confirmed with multivariate regression analysis. Results: There was no significant difference in preoperative parameters between 54 closed-box and 56 open-box PS FB TKAs. The CBL of the closed-box TKA group was 135.23 mL less (95% confidence interval [CI], -215.30 to -55.16; p = 0.001) than that of the open-box TKA group. However, the blood transfusion rates of the closed- and open-box TKA groups were not significantly different (24.1% and 38.5%, p = 0.11). For each additional minute of total operative time, 3.75 mL (95% CI, 1.75 to 5.76; p < 0.001) of blood loss was anticipated. For each additional mg/dL of preoperative hemoglobin, 71% (p < 0.001) reduction of blood transfusion probability was predicted. Conclusions: The use of closed- and open-box knee prostheses resulted in a significant difference in blood loss in SBTKA. Prolonged operative time also significantly increased CBL. Therefore, strategies to control the bleeding surface and shorten operative duration may be considered if blood loss is of special concern. The preoperative hemoglobin was the only factor that affects the probability of blood transfusion in SBTKA."

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA. All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related infections lead to significant morbidity. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines for the prevention and treatment of PD-related infections are based on variable evidence. We describe practice patterns across facilities participating in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS). METHODS: PDOPPS, a prospective cohort study, enrolled nationally representative samples of PD patients in Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Canada, Thailand, Japan, the UK and the USA. Data on PD-related infection prevention and treatment practices across facilities were obtained from a survey of medical directors'. RESULTS: A total of 170 centers, caring for >11 000 patients, were included. The proportion of facilities reporting antibiotic administration at the time of PD catheter insertion was lowest in the USA (63%) and highest in Canada and the UK (100%). Exit-site antimicrobial prophylaxis was variably used across countries, with Japan (4%) and Thailand (28%) having the lowest proportions. Exit-site mupirocin was the predominant exit-site prophylactic strategy in ANZ (56%), Canada (50%) and the UK (47%), while exit-site aminoglycosides were more common in the USA (72%). Empiric Gram-positive peritonitis treatment with vancomycin was most common in the UK (88%) and USA (83%) compared with 10-45% elsewhere. Empiric Gram-negative peritonitis treatment with aminoglycoside therapy was highest in ANZ (72%) and the UK (77%) compared with 10-45% elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in PD-related infection prevention and treatment strategies exist across countries with limited uptake of ISPD guideline recommendations. Further work will aim to understand the impact these differences have on the wide variation in infection risk between facilities and other clinically relevant PD outcomes."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Tropical forest soil carbon stocks do not increase despite 15 years of doubled litter inputs  2019, The Author(s).Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics represent a persisting uncertainty in our understanding of the global carbon cycle. SOC storage is strongly linked to plant inputs via the formation of soil organic matter, but soil geochemistry also plays a critical role. In tropical soils with rapid SOC turnover, the association of organic matter with soil minerals is particularly important for stabilising SOC but projected increases in tropical forest productivity could trigger feedbacks that stimulate the release of stored SOC. Here, we demonstrate limited additional SOC storage after 13–15 years of experimentally doubled aboveground litter inputs in a lowland tropical forest. We combined biological, physical, and chemical methods to characterise SOC along a gradient of bioavailability. After 13 years of monthly litter addition treatments, most of the additional SOC was readily bioavailable and we observed no increase in mineral-associated SOC. Importantly, SOC with weak association to soil minerals declined in response to long-term litter addition, suggesting that increased plant inputs could modify the formation of organo-mineral complexes in tropical soils. Hence, we demonstrate the limited capacity of tropical soils to sequester additional C inputs and provide insights into potential underlying mechanisms."

MaaS aims to give a new travel experience to travelers, in terms of access to the services and seamless trips on one single platform. The organization of MaaS requires a new player, a MaaS provider, who mediates the travelers (customers) and transport services. The MaaS provider takes the roles of data provider, integrator, and MaaS operator. In many pilot and implementation of MaaS schemes around the world, the MaaS providers come from various stakeholders and employ various business models. MaaS providers are crucial in that they lead the cooperation among all stakeholders and are the driving force of the services. In Bangkok, Thailand, where MaaS is a relatively new concept, the identification of a suitable MaaS provider was explored. Taking the local transport conditions, both demand and service conditions, scenarios of probable MaaS providers were investigated. The study method included literature reviews and collection of present transport setting, including the organizational arrangement. Expert interview and focus group meeting were used to form a concrete understanding and to imply the possibility of the MaaS provider in Bangkok. Three scenarios of Maas providers were set: public transport service provider, private transport service provider and third party, and Public Private Partnership. The results disclose issues that need to be resolved if the stakeholder would serve as the MaaS provider.

['Obstetrics and Gynecology'],"Prospective evaluation of screening performance of first-trimester prediction models for preterm preeclampsia in an Asian population  2019 Elsevier Inc.Background: The administration of aspirin <16 weeks gestation to women who are at high risk for preeclampsia has been shown to reduce the rate of preterm preeclampsia by 65%. The traditional approach to identify such women who are at risk is based on risk factors from maternal characteristics, obstetrics, and medical history as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. An alternative approach to screening for preeclampsia has been developed by the Fetal Medicine Foundation. This approach allows the estimation of patient-specific risks of preeclampsia that requires delivery before a specified gestational age with the use of Bayes theorem-based model. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the Fetal Medicine Foundation Bayes theorem-based model, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations for the prediction of preterm preeclampsia at 11–13+6 weeks gestation in a large Asian population Study Design: This was a prospective, nonintervention, multicenter study in 10,935 singleton pregnancies at 11–13+6 weeks gestation in 11 recruiting centers across 7 regions in Asia between December 2016 and June 2018. Maternal characteristics and medical, obstetric, and drug history were recorded. Mean arterial pressure and uterine artery pulsatility indices were measured according to standardized protocols. Maternal serum placental growth factor concentrations were measured by automated analyzers. The measured values of mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, and placental growth factor were converted into multiples of the median. The Fetal Medicine Foundation Bayes theorem-based model was used for the calculation of patient-specific risk of preeclampsia at <37 weeks gestation (preterm preeclampsia) and at any gestation (all preeclampsia) in each participant. The performance of screening for preterm preeclampsia and all preeclampsia by a combination of maternal factors, mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, and placental growth factor (triple test) was evaluated with the adjustment of aspirin use. We examined the predictive performance of the model by the use of receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration by measurements of calibration slope and calibration in the large. The detection rate of screening by the Fetal Medicine Foundation Bayes theorem-based model was compared with the model that was derived from the application of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations. Results: There were 224 women (2.05%) who experienced preeclampsia, which included 73 cases (0.67%) of preterm preeclampsia. In pregnancies with preterm preeclampsia, the mean multiples of the median values of mean arterial pressure and uterine artery pulsatility index were significantly higher (mean arterial pressure, 1.099 vs 1.008 [P<.001]; uterine artery pulsatility index, 1.188 vs 1.063[P=.006]), and the mean placental growth factor multiples of the median was significantly lower (0.760 vs 1.100 [P<.001]) than in women without preeclampsia. The Fetal Medicine Foundation triple test achieved detection rates of 48.2%, 64.0%, 71.8%, and 75.8% at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% fixed false-positive rates, respectively, for the prediction of preterm preeclampsia. These were comparable with those of previously published data from the Fetal Medicine Foundation study. Screening that used the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations achieved detection rate of 54.6% at 20.4% false-positive rate. The detection rate with the use of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline was 26.3% at 5.5% false-positive rate. Conclusion: Based on a large number of women, this study has demonstrated that the Fetal Medicine Foundation Bayes theorem-based model is effective in the prediction of preterm preeclampsia in an Asian population and that this method of screening is superior to the approach recommended by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. We have also shown that the Fetal Medicine Foundation prediction model can be implemented as part of routine prenatal care through the use of the existing infrastructure of routine prenatal care."

Mice lacking Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIB) spontaneously develop lupus-like disease or SLE at 6-month-old. The aim of this study was to investigate whether FcγRIIB deletion induces osteopenia. μCT analysis indicated that deleting FcγRIIB did not affect cancellous bone microarchitecture in 3-month-old mice in which SLE had not yet developed. However, 6- and 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males that developed an SLE-like phenotype were osteopenic and FcγRIIB deletion resulted in decreased cancellous bone volume. Histomorphometry confirmed a significant decrease in cancellous bone volume in 6- and 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males. The osteoclast number was increased without any change in osteoblast number. In vitro assays indicated that deleting FcγRIIB increased osteoclast differentiation while alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization were unaltered. These changes were associated with increases in steady-state mRNA levels for the osteoclast marker genes Trap and Ctsk. Moreover, FcγRIIB−/− mice had higher level of serum TNFα, a proinflammatory cytokine. A soluble TNFα receptor, etanercept, prevented cancellous bone loss in FcγRIIB−/− mice. Our results indicate that FcγRIIB indirectly regulates cancellous bone homeostasis following SLE development. FcγRIIB deletion induces inflammatory bone loss due to increased TNFα-mediated bone resorption without any change in bone formation in mice with SLE-like syndrome."

This study evaluated the in vitro activity and clinical efficacy of a G. speciosum pseudobulb decoction. Methods: Measure of in vitro anti-ageing activity was performed using non-cell based assays as well as in CRL 2097 human fibroblast cells. A prophetic patch test method was used to determine skin irritation in 24 healthy Thai volunteers. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 24 subjects for 56 days after facial application to evaluate efficacy. The results were measured with Visioface® and Cutometer® MPA 580 as well as by visual observations. Results: The total content of the antioxidant polyphenols in G. speciosum ethanolic extract (GSE) was 48.19 ± 0.39 mg EGCG equivalent per gram. The GSE possessed potent and higher anti-elastase activity more than EGCG. The extract was able to protect human fibroblasts against superoxide anion-induced cell death at the concentration of 10 µg mL−1. In a clinical study, facial application of the serum containing 0.5% GSE was found to safely increase skin distensibility in healthy volunteers. Skin viscoelasticity and wrinkle volume were also significantly reduced (P < 0.05).

Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of leachate dilution, inoculum, recirculation, and buffering agent addition on the acidification of Napier grass in anaerobic leach bed reactors (AnLBRs). Four AnLBRs with 14.17 L effective volume were operated at ambient temperature for 28 days in each experiment. The results clearly demonstrate the significance of the control parameters, particularly leachate dilution and inoculum, in the regulation of grass solubilization. Different dilutions of leachate produced different grass degradation rates. These different dilutions generated 95.62-112.63 g of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) or 0.52-0.62 g SCOD/g VSadded for those diluted at 1.0-7.0-day intervals compared to 51.50 g SCOD or 0.28 g SCOD/g VSadded for those without dilution. Adding inoculums of 10-30% increased the SCOD to 67.01-115.65 g SCOD or 0.40-0.59 g SCOD/g VSadded. While leachate recirculation and the addition of a buffering agent had less influence on solubilization, which increased by only 6.80-16.41% of SCOD produced. These produced leachates contained orderly acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. The proposed conditions (20% of added inoculum and leachate dilution at a 3.0-day interval), yielded practical degrees of solubilization and acidification of 46.61% and 62.21%, respectively, or 0.56 g SCOD/g VSadded and 0.26 g VFA/g VSadded. These results demonstrate that beneficial control conditions can promote the rapid and practical production of VFAs from grass biomass via an AnLBR."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyol (FODMAP) diet has been recommended for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. This study compared the efficacy of two types of dietary advice: (1) brief advice on a commonly recommended diet (BRD), and (2) structural individual low-FODMAP dietary advice (SILFD). Patients with moderate-tosevere IBS were randomized to BRD or SILFD groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms, 7-day food diaries, and post-prandial breath samples were evaluated. The SILFD included (1) identifying highFODMAP items from the diary, (2) replacing high-FODMAP items with low-FODMAP ones by choosing from the provided menu. The BRD included reducing traditionally recognized foods that cause bloating/abdominal pain and avoidance of large meals. Responders were defined as those experiencing a ≥30% decrease in the average of daily worst abdominal pain/discomfort after 4 weeks. Sixty-two patients (47 F, age 51 ± 14 years), BRD (n = 32) or SILFD (n = 30), completed the studies. Eighteen (60%) patients in SILFD vs. 9 (28%) in the BRD group fulfilled responder criteria (p = 0.001). Global IBS symptom severity significantly improved and the number of high-FODMAP items consumed was significantly decreased after SILFD compared to BRD. Post-prandial hydrogen (H2) breath production after SILFD was significantly lower than was seen after BRD (p < 0.001). SILFD was more effective than BRD. This advice method significantly reduced FODMAP intake, improved IBS symptoms, and lowered intestinal H2 production."

However, three main patterns were observed between 164 pairings of male stag beetles. Besides the predominant aggressive or fighting behavior (107 pairings), male stag beetles also exhibited disregarding behavior (29 pairings) and same-sex sexual behavior (28 pairings). For sexual interactions, active males exhibited courting and mating behavior as found in male-female interactions, but the insemination process was unsuccessful. Responses of passive males varied from totally passive to resisting and running away. Visual confusion of short-mandible males for females by active males was not likely to be responsible for the same-sex sexual behavior because the correlation between body size and the sexual behavior or sexual role between male-male pairs was not significant. Rather, sexual recognition via chemicals on the cuticle surface might be responsible for the same-sex sexual behavior."
['Pharmacology (medical)'],"Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Tacrolimus in Kidney Transplantation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies  2019, The Author(s).Background: Tacrolimus is the most commonly prescribed medication in initial immunosuppressive regimens to prevent acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Tacrolimus was originally available as an immediate-release formulation (IR-Tac) given twice daily. Extended-release tacrolimus (ER-Tac) given once daily was later developed with the expectation of improved medication adherence. Data from observational studies, which compared outcomes between ER-Tac and IR-Tac in different populations of KTRs including those who are unlikely to be enrolled in randomized clinical trials, have been reported. Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) at 12 months together with other outcomes reported in observational studies among adult KTRs who received ER-Tac compared to IR-Tac. Methods: In accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, we systematically reviewed all observational studies that compared clinical outcomes between ER-Tac and IR-Tac in KTRs. The systematic searches were conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science without language restriction. Reference lists were also searched and reviewed. Data were extracted for BPAR, graft survival, patient survival, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine (Scr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), at different times after kidney transplantation (KT). A meta-analysis was performed to integrate the results from the eligible studies. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019135705. Results: From the 1401 articles screened, 10 observational studies in KTRs who received tacrolimus were included. The pooled results showed significantly lower BPAR with ER-Tac than with IR-Tac at 12 months post-KT (5 studies, n = 659; RR, 0.69; 95% CI 0.51–0.95; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%). No significant differences in BPAR at other time points after KT were found. Graft survival, patient survival, Scr, and eGFR were comparable between groups at different times over approximately 1 year after transplantation. Conclusions: Based upon currently available evidence in observational studies, 30% lower risk of BPAR was observed in ER-Tac group compared with IR-Tac group at 12 months post-KT, while there was no significant difference in BPAR risk at any other studied time points. No differences in graft- and patient-survival rates and kidney function were found. Given the limitations of observational studies to make causal inference, as well as quality limitations among the included studies, caution should be exercised in interpreting these findings."

Several authors have proposed likelihood ratio-based statistics for testing parent-child and full sibling relationships when population substructure exists. This paper proposes three new statistics and investigates performance of each statistic based on Type I error and power. Three statistics, defined by (1) the local allele frequency, (2) the Balding-Nichols approach and (3) the ratio between the maximum of the genotype probabilities over racial subgroup, were found to be good for testing these two types of familial relationships. Power analyses within racial groups are also included, with the power highest for African-American samples and lowest for Caucasian samples. Finally, simulation studies were done on both original and extended CODIS core loci. There were clear differences in power, with the power substantially higher for extended CODIS core loci."

The structural morphology and crystalline nature of the synthesized catalyst was determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Three of the vital reaction parameters such as temperature, holding time and catalyst dosage were optimized through central composite design. A maximum bio-oil yield of 32.33% was observed for the high temperature at 320 °C, 0.75 g of catalyst dosage and 37 min of resident time. The maximum conversion was found at a lower temperature of 272 °C, the bio-oil yield of 27.66% was obtained with 0.45 g of catalyst dosage and 24 min of holding time which is an energy efficient optimum condition. The maximum bio-oil yield was influenced at a lower temperature due to the high catalytic activity. While compared to higher temperatures were not much influence was observed. It clearly states that the catalyst dosage playing a critical role in the lower temperature HTL reaction. GC-MS and FT-IR analysis of the produced bio-oil exhibits significant characteristics for biofuel applications.

However, it was limitedly described in T cell lymphoma. We explored the implication of EFS24 as a predictor marker for peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). We reviewed 293 systemic PTCL patients at 13 nationwide major university hospitals in Thailand from 2007 to 2014. The median event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of PTCL patients in our cohort was 16.3 and 27.7 months with corresponding 2-year EFS and 2-year OS of 45.8% and 51.9%, respectively. A total of 118 patients achieved EFS24 (no events during the first 24 mo). Patients who achieved EFS24 had better OS than patients who did not (2-y OS 92% vs 18.8%; HR, 0.1; P <.001). The standardized mortality ratio of patients achieving EFS24 was 18.7 (95% CI, 14.6-22.8). Multivariable analysis demonstrated performance status, histologic subtype, remission status, and EFS24 achievement as independent predictors for OS.

However, the evolution of antiviral drug resistance is a major problem for treatment of HCV infected patients. Understanding of drug-resistance mechanisms at molecular level is therefore very important for the guidance of further design of antiviral drugs with high efficiency and specificity. Paritaprevir is a potent inhibitor against HCV NS3/4A protease genotype 1a. Unfortunately, this compound is highly susceptible to the substitution at D168 in the protease. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations of paritaprevir complexed with wild-type (WT) and two mutated strains (D168 N and D168Y) were carried out. Due to such mutations, the inhibitor-protein hydrogen bonding between them was weakened and the salt-bridge network among residues R123, R155 and D168 responsible for inhibitor binding was disrupted. Moreover, the per-residue free energy decomposition suggested that the main contributions from key residues such as Q80, V132, K136, G137 and R155 were lost in the D168 N/Y mutations. These lead to a lower binding affinity of paritaprevir for D168 N/Y variants of the HCV NS3/4A protease, consistent with the experimental data. This detailed information could be useful for further design of high potency anti-HCV NS3/4A inhibitors."

Microorganisms are the main drivers of emerging antibiotic contaminant degradation in the environment. However, the feasibility and stability of the anaerobic biodegradation of TMP with sulfate as an electron acceptor remain poorly understood. Here, TMP-degrading microbial consortia were successfully enriched from municipal activated sludge (AS) and river sediment (RS) as the initial inoculums. The acclimated consortia were capable of transforming TMP through demethylation, and the hydroxyl-substituted demethylated product (4-desmethyl-TMP) was further degraded. The biodegradation of TMP followed a 3-parameter sigmoid kinetic model. The potential degraders (Acetobacterium, Desulfovibrio, Desulfobulbus, and unidentified Peptococcaceae) and fermenters (Lentimicrobium and Petrimonas) were significantly enriched in the acclimated consortia. The AS- and RS-acclimated TMP-degrading consortia had similar core microbiomes. The anaerobic biodegradation of TMP could be coupled with sulfate respiration, which gives new insights into the antibiotic fate in real environments and provides a new route for the bioremediation of antibiotic-contaminated environments.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."

The present study systematically assessed the effect of Riceberry rice extract (RBE) on the inhibition of key steps of carbohydrate and lipid digestion and absorption. The main anthocyanin identified in RBE was cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-glucoside. In the step of carbohydrate digestion and absorption, RBE markedly inhibited intestinal maltase and sucrase. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that RBE was a mix-type competitive inhibitor against intestinal maltase. In Caco-2 cells, RBE had no effect on inhibition of glucose uptake but it could suppress mRNA expression of SGLT1. The results showed that RBE caused the reduction of lipid digestion and absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, decreasing the micellar cholesterol solubility and binding of bile acid. Moreover, RBE showed non-competitive inhibition toward pancreatic lipase activity. In Caco-2 cells, RBE exhibited a significant reduction in cholesterol uptake and suppressed mRNA expression of NPC1L1 transporter. These findings provide important evidence that Riceberry rice may be a potential natural source for inhibiting the key steps of carbohydrate and lipid digestion and absorption."

['Pharmacology'],"Plumbagin inhibits cancer stem-like cells, angiogenesis and suppresses cell proliferation and invasion by targeting Wnt/β-catenin pathway in endocrine resistant breast cancer  2019 Elsevier LtdFifty percent of advanced stage ER-positive breast cancer patients develop endocrine resistance. Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin is associated with stem-like phenotypes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process which confers resistance to endocrine therapy. Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) can be a vital source of proangiogenic factors including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) which drives angiogenesis and leads to tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, targeting Wnt and FGF2 may provide effective treatment for endocrine resistant breast cancer. Our previous in vitro study reported that plumbagin (PLB) was a potent anticancer agent and was able to inhibit EMT in endocrine-resistant cells. This study aimed to further investigate the inhibitory effects of PLB on cancer stem-like phenotypes, tumorigenicity and angiogenesis. The results demonstrated Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated and was able to form mammospheres with increased cancer stem cell markers (ALDH1, NANOG, and OCT4) in endocrine-resistant cells. PLB significantly inhibited colony-forming, mammosphere formation and decreased cancer stem cell markers. The inhibitory effects of PLB on cell proliferation and invasion were mediated by Wnt signaling pathway. PLB also significantly reduced Wnt responsive genes and β-catenin. Moreover, PLB treatment at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg/day inhibited tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis without any adverse effects on body weight and blood coagulation in orthotopic xenograft nude mice. In conclusion, PLB exerted anti-cancer activity and eliminated stem-like properties by attenuating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and FGF2 expression. These findings suggest that PLB could be a promising agent to treat endocrine resistant breast cancer."

This nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to determine the physical morphologies and the nanocomposite elements. The modified electrode exhibited the improved current response towards hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) compared with an unmodified electrode and provided a low detection limit of 1.0 μM. When lactate oxidase was immobilized on the modified electrode, the electrode responded to lactate via the H2O2 generated in the enzymatic reaction. The lactate assay was performed by amperometry at a constant potential of +0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The linear range was found to be from 0.005 to 5.0 mM with a detection limit of 5.0 μM for lactate.

Use of polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of the FBoV-1 DNA in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous viremia, with the viral nucleic acid, detected by in situ hybridization (ISH), was localized in intestinal cells and vascular endothelium of intestinal mucosa and serosa, and in necrosis areas primarily in various lymph nodes while FPLV-immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral localization only in cryptal cells, neurons, and limited to leukocytes in the mesenteric lymph node. Full-length coding genome analysis of the Thai FBoV-1 strains isolated from moribund cats revealed three distinct strains with a high between-strain genetic diversity, while genetic recombination in one of the three FBoV-1 strains within the NS1 gene. This is the first report identifying natural genetic recombination of the FBoV-1 and describing the pathology and viral tropism of FBoV-1 infection in cats.

To determine whether the effects of ZOL would persist without further infusions, we compared changes in left hip and spine BMD over 36 months in participants randomized to ZOL 5 mg at baseline and month 12 (and to continue TDF) or to switch TDF (without receiving ZOL). We also compared changes in the plasma bone turnover markers (BTMs) C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX; bone resorption), and procollagen type 1 N propeptide (P1NP; bone formation) and determined whether CTX and P1NP changes at month 3 predicted BMD changes at month 36. Changes were compared in the per-protocol populations, which included 32 (74%) of 43 participants randomized to ZOL and 37 (88%) of 42 participants who switched TDF. Despite not receiving ZOL after month 12, mean hip and spine BMD change from baseline were stable and remained greater with ZOL at month 36 than with TDF switching (spine: 7.5% versus 2.7%, mean difference 4.7%, p < 0.001; hip: 5.5% versus 1.5%, mean difference 4.0%, p < 0.001). CTX and P1NP levels declined in both groups but significantly more with ZOL. Only percent changes in P1NP at month 3 correlated inversely with BMD changes at month 36 (spine: rho = −0.442, p < 0.001; hip: rho = −0.373, p = 0.002).

This study was conducted to evaluate risk factors for fatal infection in children with lupus nephritis in under-resourced areas. Methods: Medical records of patients, who were admitted to a tertiary-care university-based hospital from January 2002 to July 2018 with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, were reviewed. Only patients aged less than 18 years with lupus nephritis and documented infection were included in the study. The primary outcome was infection-associated mortality. The logistic regression model was used to identify independent variables associated with fatal infection. Predicted probabilities of infection-related mortality adjusted for factors significant in multivariate analysis were calculated using marginal effects at representative values. Results: Infection-related deaths occurred in 27 of 179 patients (15.1%). Hospital-acquired infections occurred in 72 of 375 episodes of hospital admissions (19.2%) and 13 hospital-acquired infections (18.1%) resulted in fatal infection. Invasive fungal infections were the leading cause of death (44.4%) and pulmonary infections were the predominant site (55.5%). Haemoglobin levels and glomerular filtration rates were significantly lower in deceased versus surviving patients. Percentages of patients with hospital-acquired infections, invasive fungal infections and pulmonary infections were significantly higher in deceased than surviving patients. Urine protein, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, cumulative methylprednisolone dose and daily prednisolone dose were significantly higher in deceased than surviving patients. In multivariate analysis, a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio more than 20, invasive fungal infections and high daily prednisolone dose were independently predictive of fatal infection with adjusted odds ratio of 3.02 (95% confidence interval 1.02–8.97, p = 0.04), 15.08 (95% confidence interval 4.72–48.24, p < 0.001) and 1.03 (95% confidence interval 1.01–1.06, p = 0.04), respectively. A high daily prednisolone dose intensified the impact of invasive fungal infections and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on predicted probability of infection-associated mortality. Conclusions: Prevention of invasive fungal infections and minimization of daily prednisolone should be emphasized in routine clinical practice of children with lupus nephritis in under-resourced areas to achieve better survival. Children with lupus nephritis and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio should be under cautious surveillance for infection."

Using the replicative intermediate viral dsRNA, the pepper virus strain was sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. The viral genome was de novo assembled resulting in two RNAs with lengths of 6028 and 3646 nt. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that they corresponded to the RNA-1 and RNA-2 of a novel comovirus which we tentatively named pepper mild mosaic virus (PepMMV). Predictions of the open reading frame (ORF) of RNA-1 resulted in a single ORF of 5871 nt with five cistrons typical of comoviruses, cofactor proteinase, helicase, viral protein genome-linked, 3C-like proteinase (Pro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Similarly, sequence analysis of RNA-2 resulted in a single ORF of 3009 nt with two cistrons typical of comoviruses: movement protein and coat protein (large coat protein and small coat proteins). In pairwise amino acid sequence alignments using the Pro-Pol protein, PepMMV shared the closest identities with broad bean true mosaic virus and cowpea mosaic virus, 56% and 53.9% respectively. In contrast, in alignments of the amino acid sequence of the coat protein (small and large coat proteins) PepMMV shared the closest identities to APMoV and red clover mottle virus, 54% and 40.9% respectively. A phylogenetic tree constructed using the conserved domains for the Pro-Pol from all members of the family Secoviridae confirmed the comovirus nature of the virus. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses supports proposing PepMMV as a new species of the genus Comovirus."

This holistic study has investigated the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS), anti-infection, antioxidant and anti-photoaging properties of neglected plant Diplocyclos palmatus. The results showed that D. palmatus methanolic leaf extract (DPME) effectively inhibited the quorum sensing (QS) regulated virulence factor production as well as biofilm formation in Serratia marcescens. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that DPME significantly downed the expression of QS-regulated genes such as fimA, fimC, flhC, bsmB, pigP and shlA in S. marcescens, which supports the outcome of in vitro bioassays. Further, the docking study revealed that the presence of active compounds, namely tocopherols and phytol, DPME exhibited its anti-QS activity against S. marcescens. In addition, DPME treatment extended the lifespan of S. marcescens infected C. elegans by the action of dropping the internal accumulation. Further, qPCR analysis clearly revealed that DPME treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of the lifespan-related gene (daf-16) and immune-related genes (clec-60, clec-87, lys-7 and bec-1) in S. marcescens infected C.elegans. On the other hand, DPME extensively reduced the UV-A induced ROS stress, thereby, extended the lifespan in UV-A photoaged C. elegans. Further, the qPCR analysis also confirmed the up-regulation of daf-16, clec-60, clec-87 and col-19 genes which advocated the improvement of the lifespan, healthspan and collagen production in UV-A photoaged C. elegans. Further bioassays evidenced that that the lifespan extension of photoaged C. elegans was accomplished by the actions of antioxidants such as tocopherols and phytol in DPME."

In Thailand, providing support to young people to start farming is one possible way to ensure that some farms will continue to innovate and play an active economic role in the future. This study investigated if and how Thai agriculture students plan to become farmers. We interviewed a total of 187 agriculture students taking vocational courses or working towards a university degree focused on training future farmers. Among these students, 61% planned to become full-time farmers at some point in the future and 32% planned to farm part-time as a secondary income-generating activity. Most of the students aimed to set up farms that were diversified, knowledge-intensive and capital-intensive. Therefore, although many students came from a farming family and would be able to access some of their parents’ land in the future, most considered that they did not have yet the necessary resources, such as capital and farming skills, to become farmers. Consequently, many students planned to spend time, often up to 10 years and sometimes more, acquiring these resources before starting a farm. Public policies could provide support to shorten this period if graduates in agriculture are to be among young people who engage in farming."

Purposes were to determine the association of serum adipokine levels, anthropometrics and biomarkers measurements with bodyweight and functional status in CCP. Methods: Seventy-two CCP (age 8.7 ± 1.9 years) were enrolled. They were classified by body mass index (BMI) into thinness, normal and overweight and were characterized by the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Serum levels of adipokines (leptin, adiponectin and resistin) were analyzed. A multivariate regression model was used to examine variables associated with BMI and GMFCS. Correlations between serum adipokines, BMI and GMFCS classifications were evaluated. Results: The CCP with overweight had the prevalence of 24% and had remarkably higher levels of serum leptin (p < 0.05). Strong relationships were observed between BMI and age, leptin, triceps skinfold thickness and hemoglobin (p < 0.05). Serum leptin levels were positively correlated (p < 0.001) with BMI. A negative association between BMI and serum adiponectin levels was observed (p = 0.03). In contrast, serum resistin levels did not associate with BMI. Serum adipokine concentrations did not correlate with the GMFCS classification. Conclusions: The treatment for CCP should aim to control weight in order to balance adipokine and functional levels and reduce risks of subsequent metabolic disorders."

Based on this review, a series of workshops were held with young rural people and young farmers in Thailand to assess the most promising policy tools. During the workshops, participants discussed a set of 22 policy tools designed to support access to land, capital and markets, capacity-building and making farming a more attractive profession. The workshop participants thought almost all the proposed policy tools would be useful but gave priority to subsidies to start farming and to secure land leases. Reversing the current, very rapid decrease in the number of young farmers in Thailand will require ambitious programmes, which could not only focus on helping young people who are already interested in farming but also appeal to a broader public by making farming more attractive."
['Pharmacology'],"An immune gate of depression – Early neuroimmune development in the formation of the underlying depressive disorder  2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of SciencesThe prevalence of depression worldwide is increasing from year to year and constitutes a serious medical, economic and social problem. Currently, despite multifactorial risk factors and pathways contributing to depression development, a significant aspect is attributed to the inflammatory process. Cytokines are considered a factor activating the kynurenine pathway, which leads to the exhaustion of tryptophan in the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway. This results in the activation of potentially neuroprogressive processes and also affects the metabolism of many neurotransmitters. The immune system plays a coordinating role in mediating inflammatory process. Beginning from foetal life, dendritic cells have the ability to react to bacterial and viral antigens, stimulating T lymphocytes in a similar way to adult cells. Cytotoxicity in the prenatal period shapes the predisposition to the development of depression in adult life. Allostasis, i.e. the ability to maintain the body's balance in the face of environmental adversity through changes in its behaviour or physiology, allows the organism to survive but its consequences may be unfavourable if it lasts too long. As a result, Th lymphocytes, in particular T helper 17 cells, which play a central role in the immunity of the whole body, contribute to the development of both autoimmune diseases and psychiatric disorders including depression, as well as have an impact on the differentiation of T CD4+ cells into Th17 cells in the later development of the child's organism, which confirms the importance of the foetal period for the progression of depressive disorders."

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of a single topical treatment of selamectin (Revolution®) against A. ceylanicum in experimentally infected cats. 12 kittens were injected with 300 infective stage larvae (L3) of A. ceylanicum by the subcutaneous route. Faecal samples were examined daily (days 7–15) for the presence of hookworm eggs. On day 18 kittens were stratified by faecal egg count and randomly allocated in equal numbers to control (n = 6) and treatment (n = 6) groups. Faecal egg counts were then performed daily (days 14–27) or every 3 days (days 28–51) until the end of the study and compared between the treated and control groups. Kittens in the treatment group were administered a single topical dose of selamectin (Revolution®), per label recommendations (6 mg/kg), on day 19. Kittens in the control group were not treated. At 4 days post-treatment, no hookworm eggs were detected in the treated group. Faecal samples from this group remained negative throughout the study, the treatment efficacy was 100% egg reduction (P < .0001). Average faecal egg counts remained high (558 ± 231 eggs per gram) in the untreated control group until the end of the study period. In conclusion, a single topical treatment of selamectin (Revolution®) at the recommended dose was highly efficacious against infection with A. ceylanicum in cats."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Structural and In Vitro Functional Analyses of Novel Plant-Produced Anti-Human PD1 Antibody  2019, The Author(s).Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising and effective treatment for cancer. The frequently used immunotherapy agents are immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies specific to PD1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4. However, these drugs are highly expensive, and most people in the world cannot access the treatment. The development of recombinant protein production platforms that are cost-effective, scalable, and safe is needed. Plant platforms are attractive because of their low production cost, speed, scalability, lack of human and animal pathogens, and post-translational modifications that enable them to produce effective monoclonal antibodies. In this study, an anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plant-produced anti-PD1 mAb was compared to the commercial nivolumab produced in CHO cells. Our results showed that both antibodies have similar protein structures, and the N-glycans on the plant-produced antibody lacks plant-specific structures. The PD1 binding affinity of the plant-produced and commercial nivolumab, determined by two different techniques, that is, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), are also comparable. Plant-produced nivolumab binds to human PD1 protein with high affinity and specificity, blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and enhances T cell function, comparable to commercial nivolumab. These results confirmed that plant-produced anti-PD1 antibody has the potential to be effective agent for cancer immunotherapy."

This study aimed to describe characteristics and outcomes of Thai ALL patients, and to determine the differences between adolescent and young adult (AYA) and adult ALL. ALL patients aged > 15 years were prospectively enrolled from 2015 to 2017. AYA patients were defined as age ≤ 39 years. Out of the 188 enrolled ALL patients, 9 were excluded due to changes in diagnosis or incomplete data. From the remaining 179 patients, 103 (57.5%) were AYA and 76 (42.5%) were adult. AYA ALL patients were predominantly male, had higher T-cell phenotype, higher white blood cells and hemoglobin, with lower frequency of Philadelphia chromosome or BCR-ABL1 mutation. All patients received treatment by adult hematologist, however 40.8% of AYA ALL patients were treated with pediatric adapted protocol. The effects of stem cell transplantation (SCT) and age were determined by stratified patients as: AYA - no SCT 91 (51.1%), AYA - SCT 12 (6.7%), adult - no SCT 64 (36.0%) and adult - SCT 11 (6.2%). The 2-year overall survival were: 53.9%, 60.6%, 39.2% and 70.1%, respectively. The 2-year event-free survival were: 45.0%, 54.0%, 21.0% and 49.9%, respectively. This is a large multicenter ALL cohort study conducted in Thailand. Patients who underwent SCT showed significantly improved OS and EFS, confirming the benefit of graft-versus-leukemia effect in ALL.

Prolonged use of antibiotics especially in acne is one issue of concern among dermatologists. Ketoconazole (KTZ) cream, a topical antifungal with anti-inflammatory and antiandrogenic actions, can decrease lipase activity of Cutibacterium acnes in vitro. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of KTZ cream in mild adult female acne (AFA) by conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using KTZ 2% and placebo cream twice daily for 10 weeks. We assessed the improvement of clinical severity, measured by AFA score graded by investigators and participants, and the change of acne count. Forty-one participants enrolled in our study. The proportion of participants with acne improvement from baseline (42.9% vs 9.5%, P = 0.015) and the success rate (45.0% vs 14.3%, P = 0.043) in the KTZ group were significantly higher than that of the placebo group. The most common adverse events were dryness and itching. The percentage change of acne count decreased significantly compared with baseline but did not differ statistically between the two groups (P = 0.268). We concluded that the KTZ monotherapy showed a plausible effect in improving AFA with excellent safety profile. It should be considered as a viable option for mild AFA treatment."

Objective: To examine whether TNF-α, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 are associated with MS diagnosis, disability, disability progression and clinical forms of MS. Materials and subjects: The study included 147 patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 21 with progressive clinical forms (ProgMS) and 70 controls. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) evaluated disability as mild (EDSS < 3.0) or moderate/high (EDSS ≥ 3.0). Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) evaluated disability progression as no progression (MSSS < 5) and progression (MSSS ≥ 5). Baseline data of subjects and plasma levels of TNF-α, sTNFR1, sTNFR2 were obtained. Results: The MS diagnosis explained 44.6% and 12.3% of TNF-α and sTNFR2 levels, respectively. Moderate/high disability and disability progression were best predicted by sTNFR1 and age (positively) and ProgMS were best predicted by sTNFR1 (positively) and sTNFR2 (negatively), coupled with age and sex. A composite score reflecting the sTNFR1/sTNFR2 ratio showed a positive association with ProgMS after adjusting for age and sex. Conclusion: Increased sTNFR1 and age were positively associated with disability and disability progression, whereas increased sTNFR1 (positively) and sTNFR2 (negatively) were associated with ProgMS, suggesting a distinct role of them in the immunopathological mechanisms of MS."

We investigated associations between two functional measures of sarcopenia, grip strength and gait speed (GS), with functional disability in adults from six LMICs. Data were extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health Wave 1 (2007–2010) for adults (≥ 65 years) from China, Mexico, Ghana, India, Russia and South Africa (n = 10,892, 52.8% women). We calculated country-specific prevalence of low grip strength, slow GS (≤ 0.8 m/s), and both measures combined. Using multivariable negative binomial regression, we separately assessed associations between low grip strength, slow GS, and both measures combined, with the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, accounting for selected socioeconomic factors. In women, low grip strength ranged from 7 in South Africa to 51% in India; in men, it ranged from 17 in Russia to 51% in Mexico. Country-specific proportions of slow GS ranged from 77 in Russia, to 33% in China. The concomitant presence of both was the lowest in South Africa and the highest in India (12.3% vs. 33%). Independent of age, those with both low grip strength and slow GS had between 1.2- and 1.5-fold worse functional disability scores, independent of comorbidities, low education, and low wealth (all country-dependent). Low grip strength, slow GS, and the combination of both, were all associated with higher levels of functional disability, thus indicating these objective measures offer a reasonably robust estimate for potential poor health outcomes."
"['Organic Chemistry', 'Polymers and Plastics', 'Materials Chemistry']","Effect of acrylonitrile content of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber on mechanical and thermal properties of dynamically vulcanized poly(lactic acid) blends  2019 Society of Chemical IndustryWe report here the morphology, thermal and tensile properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blends composed of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) with different acrylonitrile contents with/without dynamic vulcanization by dicumyl peroxide (DCP). The interfacial tension of PLA and NBR measured by contact angle measurement decreased as the acrylonitrile content of NBR decreased. Likewise, SEM images showed that the rubber particle size reduced with decreasing acrylonitrile content owing to the stronger interfacial adhesion between the PLA matrix and NBR domains. Incorporation of DCP at 1.0 phr for dynamic vulcanization led to higher crosslink density and, in turn, optimal tensile strength and tensile toughness as a result of the action of PLA-NBR copolymer as a reactive compatibilizer. The dynamic vulcanization of the blends containing low acrylonitrile NBR gave the most improved tensile properties because the free radicals from DCP decomposition preferentially attacked the allylic hydrogen atoms or double bonds of the butadiene backbone. Accordingly, more NBR macroradicals were generated and probably more PLA-NBR copolymers were produced. Moreover, further addition of DCP at 2.0 phr provided a large amount of crosslinked NBR gel, which significantly degraded the tensile properties. From the DSC results, dynamic vulcanization lowered the cold crystallization temperature, implying an improvement of cold crystallization. Finally, TGA results showed a higher degradation temperature as a function of DCP content, which suggested that thermal stability increased due to stronger interfacial adhesion as well as higher gel content.  2019 Society of Chemical Industry."

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: There are controversial data regarding the relationship between hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and arrhythmias. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the incidence of arrhythmias in patients following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: A literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Databases from inception through April 2019. Pooled incidence with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42019131833). Results: Thirteen studies consisting of 10,587 patients undergoing HSCT were enrolled in this systematic review. Overall, the pooled estimated incidence of all types of arrhythmias following HSCT was 7.2% (95% CI: 4.9%-10.5%). With respect to the most common type of arrhythmia, the pooled estimated incidence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) within 30 days following HSCT was 4.2% (95% CI: 1.7%-9.6%). Egger's regression test demonstrated no significant publication bias in this meta-analysis of post-HSCT arrhythmia incidence. Conclusion: The overall estimated incidence of arrhythmias following HSCT was 7.2%. Future large scale studies are needed to further elucidate the significance and clinical impact of arrhythmias in post-HSCT patients."
"['Environmental Chemistry', 'Aquatic Science']","Enhanced efficacy of immersion vaccination in tilapia against columnaris disease by chitosan-coated “pathogen-like” mucoadhesive nanovaccines  2019 Elsevier LtdRed tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) has become one of the most important fish in aquaculture. Bacterial infection caused by Flavobacterium columnare, the causative agent of columnaris disease, has been now identified as one of the most serious infectious diseases in farmed red tilapia and cause major financial damage to the producers. Among the effective prevention and control strategies, vaccination is one of the most effective approach. As the surface of living fish is covered by mucus and directly associated with the mucosal immunity, we therefore hypothesized that better adsorption on mucosal surfaces and more efficient vaccine efficacy could be enhanced biomimetic nanoparticles mimicking the mucoadhesive characteristic of live F. columnare. In this work, we describe an effective approach to targeted antigen delivery by coating the surface of nanoparticles with mucoadhesive chitosan biopolymer to provide “pathogen-like” properties that ensure nanoparticles binding on fish mucosal membrane. The physiochemical properties of nanovaccines were analyzed, and their mucoadhesive characteristics and immune response against pathogens were also evaluated. The prepared vaccines were nano-sized and spherical as confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The analysis of hydrodynamic diameter and zeta-potential also suggested the successful modification of nanovaccines by chitosan as indicated by positively charged and the overall increased diameter of chitosan-modified nanovaccines. In vivo mucoadhesive study demonstrated the excellent affinity of the chitosan-modified nanovaccines toward fish gills as confirmed by bioluminescence imaging, fluorescent microscopy, and spectrophotometric quantitative measurement. Following vaccination with the prepared nanovaccines by immersion 30 min, the challenge test was then carried out 30 and 60 days post-vaccination and resulted in high mortalities in the control. The relative percent survival (RPS) of vaccinated fish was greater than 60% for mucoadhesive nanovaccine. Our results also suggested that whole-cell vaccines failed to protect fish from columnaris infection, which is consistent with the mucoadhesive assays showing that whole-cell bacteria were unable to bind to mucosal surfaces. In conclusion, we could use this system to deliver antigen preparation to the mucosal membrane of tilapia and obtained a significant increase in survival compared to controls, suggesting that targeting mucoadhesive nanovaccines to the mucosal surface could be exploited as an effective method for immersion vaccination."

Methods: Anticancer, antimigration, anti-invasion effects and anchorage-independent growth were investigated by MTT, scratch, matrigel invasion and soft agar assays. Estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted genes and endocrine-resistant genes were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot. Key findings: Ethoxy mansonone G is the most potent MG derivative and has anticancer effects in ER-positive, endocrine-resistant and ER-negative breast cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that EMG can significantly inhibit estrogen-induced cell proliferation and the expression of ER-targeted genes in ER-positive breast cancer cells, suggesting the anti-estrogenic property of EMG which is consisting with the virtual molecular docking that EMG could possibly bind to the ERα. Moreover, EMG has synergistic effect with tamoxifen in endocrine-resistant cells. EMG also inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and anchorage-independent growth by reducing expression of genes involved in endocrine resistance and invasive factors during the metastatic process. Conclusion: Ethoxy mansonone G has an anticancer effect in breast cancer cells and is possible to use as a therapeutic agent in patients with breast cancer."

International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjectives: A previous individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) identified differences in major depression classification rates between different diagnostic interviews, controlling for depressive symptoms on the basis of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. We aimed to determine whether similar results would be seen in a different population, using studies that administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in pregnancy or postpartum. Methods: Data accrued for an EPDS diagnostic accuracy IPDMA were analysed. Binomial generalised linear mixed models were fit to compare depression classification odds for the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID), controlling for EPDS scores and participant characteristics. Results: Among fully structured interviews, the MINI (15 studies, 2,532 participants, 342 major depression cases) classified depression more often than the CIDI (3 studies, 2,948 participants, 194 major depression cases; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.21, 11.43]).

In ophthalmology, epidermal growth factor (EGF) in human amniotic membrane (HAM) promotes corneal epithelial cell proliferation and migration, thus it facilitates corneal wound healing. In dogs, with limited cryopreserved HAM availability, different cold glycerol preserving protocols have been developed for the storage canine amniotic membrane (CAM). This study aimed to study protein expression of EGF in CAM preserved with different concentrations of glycerol and storage temperatures, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CAM preserved in 50% glycerol and 99.5% glycerol and kept at 4 and − 20 °C for 7–30 days were compared. We found that preserving membrane with 50% glycerol at − 20 °C has significantly higher EGF protein expression compared with that at 4 °C (p < 0.05). There was a trend that the storage in 50% glycerol achieved higher EGF protein expression than 99.5% glycerol at both 4 °C and − 20 °C. In conclusion, 50% glycerol at − 20 °C was the best condition to preserve CAM in our study. Therefore, there is likely an alternative method to maintain level of EGF protein expression in preserved CAM."

These giant molecular clouds (GMCs), with 104–107 solar masses (M⊙) and radii of 5–100 parsecs, are the seeds of star formation1. Highlighting the molecular gas structure at such small scales in distant galaxies is observationally challenging. Only a handful of molecular clouds were reported in two extreme submillimetre galaxies at high redshift2–4. Here we search for GMCs in a typical Milky Way progenitor at z = 1.036. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we mapped the CO(4–3) emission of this gravitationally lensed galaxy at high resolution, reading down to 30 parsecs, which is comparable to the resolution of CO observations of nearby galaxies5. We identify 17 molecular clouds, characterized by masses, surface densities and supersonic turbulence all of which are 10–100 times higher than present-day analogues. These properties question the universality of GMCs6 and suggest that GMCs inherit their properties from ambient interstellar medium. The measured cloud gas masses are similar to the masses of stellar clumps seen in the galaxy in comparable numbers7. This corroborates the formation of molecular clouds by fragmentation of distant turbulent galactic gas disks8,9, which then turn into stellar clumps ubiquitously observed in galaxies at ‘cosmic noon’ (ref. 10)."

Results of morphological, elemental, and structural analyses revealed directly grown and interconnected δ-MnO2 crumpled nanosheets on a carbon fiber substrate. Moreover, an improvement via a simple annealing strategy in the stacking, surface area and conductivity of the δ-MnO2 sheets was observed. Annealing induces the rearrangement of δ-MnO2 sheets resulting in the transformation from turbostratic stacking to a well-ordered stacking of δ-MnO2 sheets, as indicated by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) hexagonal single crystal pattern. Besides, the formation of the well-ordered stacking of δ-MnO2 sheets exhibited improved electrochemical performance and cyclability, as cathode material for ZIB. The novel strategy described in this study is an essential step for the development of binder-free δ-MnO2-C fiber composite with a well-ordered stacking of δ-MnO2 sheets.

['Multidisciplinary'],"The Influence of Dimethyl Sulfoxide as Electrolyte Additive on Anodic Dissolution of Alkaline Zinc-Air Flow Battery  2019, The Author(s).The present work describes the effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in KOH aqueous electrolyte on the performance of a zinc-air flow battery. Aqueous electrolytes containing 7 M KOH and (0 to 20)% v/v DMSO were studied revealing a critical role of DMSO on the dissolution and deposition of zinc. The anodic zinc dissolution process was studied via cyclic voltammetry, Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The presence of DMSO showed improved zinc dissolution performance with the highest peak of zinc dissolution being the electrolyte containing 5% v/v DMSO. Tafel analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in polarization resistance and an increase in corrosion rate due to the introduction of DMSO to the electrolyte. This suggests that DMSO has the ability to suspend zinc oxide in the electrolyte, thus preventing passivation of the zinc surface. EIS results revealed that by adding DMSO to the electrolyte, charge transfer resistance increased. This is attributed to the formation of passive layers having arisen from DMSO adsorption, the formation of zincate ions in the vicinity of the zinc surface, and the deposition of discharged products. A difference in Nyquist plots was observed for 20% v/v DMSO/KOH and 0% v/v DMSO/KOH electrolytes implying non-Debye relaxation behavior taking place due to the surface effects. The electrolytes were implemented in a zinc-air flow battery. Maximum power densities of 130 mW/cm2 (5% v/v DMSO) and 125 mW/cm2 (20% v/v DMSO) were obtained and were observed to be about 43% and 28% higher than that of the DMSO-free electrolyte. Results indicated that when 20% v/v DMSO was added to KOH solution, there was 67% zinc utilization efficiency (550 mAh/g) which provided 20% improvement in discharge capacity. Further, the battery with 20% v/v DMSO demonstrated excellent cyclability. Overall, DMSO shows great promise for enhancement of zinc dissolution/deposition in zinc-air batteries."

In the present study, we evaluated whether IL-17 could facilitate certain neutrophil functions in a mouse model. Mice were divided into four groups and intranasally challenged with PBS (1 = Control), Influenza A (H1N1) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 = Mix), Influenza A alone (3 = Flu), or K. pneumoniae (4 = KP) alone. Bone marrow, BAL cells, and lung specimens were collected seven days post-challenge for analysis. Mice in the Flu group showed the highest mortality rate. Neutrophils were the prominent cell type in BAL from Mix and KP, whereas lymphocytes were most numerous in Flu. Lesions in the lungs revealed considerably damage in the Mix, Flu, and KP groups. Isolated bone marrow-derived neutrophils were in vitro primed with mouse recombinant IL-17A protein (rIL-17A) followed by various functional assays. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in rIL-17A primed cells showed significant elevations in all groups. Phagocytosis and bacterial destruction showed no significant difference between (+) or (−) rIL-17A groups. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in rIL-17A-primed neutrophils showed elevated NET production. We next monitored expressions of genes in neutrophils. IL-17A mRNA expression was significantly increased in Mix and Flu; IL-1β mRNA only significantly increased in Flu, and IL-17RA showed constitutive expressions in all groups. In summary, neutrophils may cause tissue damage during lung inflammation through specific functions influenced by IL-17."

We then assessed genetic effects on AD characteristics (drinking volume/age onset/Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST)/Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)), and compared the polygenic risk of AD in Han Chinese with other populations (Thai, European American and African American). We found and validated two significant loci, one located in 4q23, with lead SNP rs2075633*ADH1B (Pdiscovery = 6.64 × 10−16) and functional SNP rs1229984*ADH1B (Pdiscovery = 3.93 × 10−13); and the other located in 12q24.12-12q24.13, with lead SNP rs11066001*BRAP (Pdiscovery = 1.63 × 10−9) and functional SNP rs671*ALDH2 (Pdiscovery = 3.44 × 10−9). ADH1B rs1229984 was associated with MAST, BIS_total score and average drinking volume. Polygenic risk scores from the Thai AD and European American AD GWAS were significantly associated with AD in Han Chinese, which were entirely due to the top two loci, however there was no significant prediction from African Americans. This is the first case-control AD GWAS in Han Chinese. Our findings demonstrate that these variants, which were highly linked with ALDH2 rs671 and ADH1B rs1229984, were significant modulators for AD in our Han Chinese cohort. A larger replication cohort is still needed to validate our findings."

However, silver nanoprisms are toxic to mammalian cells. To alleviate this problem, synthesis of silver nanoprisms via a light-induced transformation reaction with LED light was proposed. This reaction was ecofriendly and excluded hazards from the use of harmful oxidizing agents. Different shape and size of the as-grown silver nanocrystals could be distinguished by their colors. Results showed that the nano-octahedron photomediated silver nanoprisms showed the strongest bacterial inhibition with MIC and MBC value of 6.74, 6.74, 13.38, and 6.74 μg/mL against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), respectively. Silver nanoprisms were later impregnated within bacterial celluloses (BC) and the resulting composite films (PAgNPrs/BC) also exhibited the antibacterial activity against the four above microbes. Indirect cytotoxicity evaluation of the PAgNPrs/BC-composite films with human dermal fibroblasts proved that these films were non-toxic. All the results suggested that the PAgNPrs/BC-composite films could be used to care for certain infectious wounds."

In this synthetic strategy based on the grafting from concept, sericin molecule acts as a bio-initiator where its hydroxyl groups existing in serine units. The effects of polymerization parameters, including reaction temperature, the concentration of catalyst and sericin, on the copolymer structure and properties were investigated. XPS spectra of SS-g-PLA copolymer showed C1S and N1S signals clearly and differed form that of the neat PLA. 2D HMBC NMR spectra showed correlation assigned to the carbon atom of PLA polymer chains and hydrogen atom in hydroxyl group of serine. Molecular weight of the graft copolymer by GPC was in range of 4000–5600 g mol−1. From soxhlet extraction, the results showed that PLA content in the graft copolymer molecules increased with increasing sericin content. The weight ratio of PLA to sericin in the SS-g-PLA5, SS-g-PLA10 and SS-g-PLA15 graft copolymers were 0.6:1, 1.4:1 and 2.1:1, respectively. By nitrogen analyzer,%protein increased significantly with increasing sericin content. Thermal analysis showed that the graft copolymer presented a single glass-transition temperature (Tg) belonging to PLA. This Tg decreased with increasing sericin content. The thermal degradation temperature (Td) of SS-g-PLA copolymer decreased to about 60 °C. Furthermore, SS-g-PLA is expected to utilize in biomedical applications."
"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","Elastic buckling of cellular columns under axial compression  2019 Elsevier LtdA calculation of the elastic buckling load for cellular columns with multiple circular openings is required to determine their axial load capacity. Due to the complexity of column geometry and shear effects, the available methods to analyze the elastic buckling load are limited. This study proposes a method of calculation the elastic buckling load about the major axis of a pin-ended cellular column. The analysis is based on simplification of the column geometry and uses an effective length of shear force transfer across openings in the columns. The shear force in the column causes additional deformations of the web-post and the Tee section of cellular columns. The buckling load is derived by using differential equations of total curvature of the buckling curve, which is the sum of curvatures due to moment and shear forces. The proposed buckling load estimate is validated by comparisons with finite element analysis. A parametric study of the column geometry effects on shear, such as the section ratios, the opening ratios, the spacing ratios and the slendernesses, was also conducted. The shear effects clearly increases with open area fraction in the web, and with the section ratios. It was found that the spacing ratio affects the buckling load more than the opening ratio. Overall, the shear effects degrade the buckling load by less than 20% when the slenderness exceeds 50 compared to the Euler buckling load."

The effects of calcination temperatures were studied at 400 °C (ST-4), 500 °C (ST-5), to 600 °C (ST-6). The characterization results indicated that the achieved Ag species in all of the prepared Ag-anatase composites were stable in Ag (0) which was confirmed by X-ray absorption near the edge structure (XANES) and detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The deposition of tiny Ag species (10–20 nm in size) on the anatase surface was observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The photoluminescence (PL) characterization results revealed that the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was significantly reduced after the deposition of Ag nanoparticles and was decreased as the calcination temperature increased. The ST-6 possessed the highest photocatalytic performance which can degrade rhodamine B (10 ppm) by using 0.05 g of the prepared composites under UV irradiation within 1 h. It could be concluded that metallic Ag nanoparticles deposited on the anatase surface induced by the calcination process can possibly play an important role in the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of bare-anatase."

Methods: A cross-sectional design was conducted. Twenty abdominal obesity and twenty control males were performed four body positions for 5 min each: (1) sitting without back support, (2) sitting with back support, (3) Fowler's position, and (4) supine. Kinematics of chest wall including thoracoabdominal asynchrony, diameter changes, and ventilatory function were evaluated using optoelectronic plethysmography. Results: Thoracoabdominal asynchrony in obesity group has higher than control group among body position (p < 0.01). Obesity group significantly decreased diameter changes across body positions compared to control group (p < 0.01). Sitting without and with back support showed the lowest for thoracoabdominal asynchrony but the greatest chest wall diameter changes and ventilatory function than Fowler's and supine positions (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The current finding supports the significant effect of abdominal obesity and different body positions on kinematics of chest wall. Both sitting without and with support positions are recommended for synchronizing thoracoabdominal motion, maximizing chest wall diameter changes, and ventilatory function – this would therefore likely reduce the risk of respiratory disease and complications compared with lying positions."

To test the feasibility of N-doped biochars obtained under different pyrolysis temperatures as catalyst supports, a series of Ru catalysts were prepared for use in the methanation and the catalysts were labelled as Ru/N-ABC-x, where x represented the pretreatment temperatures(500, 600 and 700 °C). Besides, the catalytic test of Ru/ABC which was prepared under the same conditions without N modification was also conducted for comparison. The probe reaction test of CO2 methanation showed that the Ru/N-ABC-600 catalyst with the highest pyridinic-N (37.7%) content had superior or comparable catalytic performance to Ru/N-ABC-500 and Ru/N-ABC-700 prepared from N-doped biochar with different pyridinic-N content. A high CO2 conversion of 93.8% with a CH4 selectivity of 99.7% was achieved on Ru/N-ABC-600 under the optimum reaction conditions (380 °C, 1 MPa, n(H2)/n(CO2) of 4, with a gas hourly space velocity of 6000 mL·g-1·h-1).

All synthesized molecules can detect F− and CN− with fast response with naked eye color change and quenching of fluorescence. Most common competitive anions have paltry interferences during the optical sensing of F−, while only nitro and methyl furan substituted provided good selectivity to CN− in THF. Substituents on heterocyclic directly affect fluoride capturing sensitivity, namely, electron donating group provides more sensitivity than with electron withdrawing groups. 1H NMR confirms the H-bonding between sensor molecule and F−/CN−. The detection limits of the four-sensor molecules were found below 0.3 ppm for F− and CN− detection. The magnitude of fluorescence quenching was estimated through Stern-Volmer plots. Test strips experimentation revealed the on-site solid-state detection efficacy of the sensors. Addition of Cu(II) ions to nitro and methyl furan substituted, resulted in selective discrimination between F− and CN− in THF. Computational studies prove the agreement of reactivity for four optical molecules interaction with F− and show that substituent at furan/thiophene does not affect the sensitivity, this is contrary to traditional school of thoughts."

Controlling either bulk dissolved oxygen (DO) or free ammonia (FA) concentration to maintain partial nitrification can be challenging due to the strong interdependency between these two parameters as substrates for ammonia oxidation. In this study, DO/FA ratio is proposed as a controlling parameter for partial nitrification by entrapped-cell-based reactors. At DO/FA >1.5, both ammonia and nitrite oxidation proceeded without inhibition leading to complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate. An effluent containing nitrate as the main nitrogen species can be produced at these ratios. At a DO/FA ratio range of 0.2–1.5, ammonia oxidation proceeded without efficiency deterioration, while nitrite oxidation decreased with decreasing DO/FA ratio. At the ratios of 0.2–0.6, an effluent containing mainly nitrite can be generated. At DO/FA <0.2, both ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation were inhibited and the effluent with nearly equal molar of ammonia and nitrite was obtained. By controlling DO/FA ratio, effluents with different proportions of nitrogen species can be produced allowing the entrapped-cell-based system to be adaptable as an initial reactor for various nitrogen removal approaches."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Role of Clathrin Assembly Protein-2 Beta Subunit during White Spot Syndrome Virus Infection in Black Tiger Shrimp Penaeus monodon  2019, The Author(s).White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the most lethal viruses severely affecting shrimp industry. This disease can cause 100% mortality of farmed shrimp within a week. This work aims to characterize clathrin assembly proteins in Penaeus monodon and investigate their roles in WSSV entry. In general, clathrin assembly proteins form complexes with specific receptors and clathrins, leading to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), which is responsible for endocytosis at plasma membrane, consists of four subunits including α, β2, μ2 and σ2. Knockdown of clathrin coat AP17, or σ subunit of AP-2 dramatically reduced WSSV infectivity. Similar results were observed, when shrimp were pre-treated with chlorpromazine (CPZ), an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The complete open reading frames of AP-2β and μ subunits of P. monodon are reported. PmAP-2 β was up-regulated about 4-fold at 6 and 36 h post-WSSV infection. Knockdown of PmAP-2β delayed shrimp mortality during WSSV infection, of which WSSV intermediate early 1 gene expression was also down-regulated. Immunogold-labelling and transmission electron microscopy revealed that PmAP-2β co-localized with WSSV particles at plasma membrane. In addition, PmAP-2β-silencing significantly affected the expression levels of PmSTAT, PmDOME, PmDorsal and ALFPm3 during WSSV infection. It is possible that PmAP-2β is associated with the JAK/STAT and the Toll pathway."

This includes factors such as light, humidity and temperature in the warehouse and also the packaging material used. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of type of packaging materials namely high density polyethylene (HDPE) bag and jute sack on moisture content, colour, phenolic contents, chlorogenic acids content and antioxidant activity of Arabica green coffee bean during 15 months of storage. The results show that HDPE bag can preserve the moisture content, colour and chlorogenic acid in green coffee beans (GCB) better than a jute sack during storage. No significant difference of phenolics content in green coffee beans was observed during 4 months of storage in both types of packaging. During initial 10 months of storage the antioxidant activity of GCB stored in HDPE showed higher values than that of GCB stored in jute sack. However, after 1 year of storage, the phenolics content and antioxidant activity in GCB in a jute sack were higher than in HDPE bag. The fluctuation of moisture content could lead to stress condition of green coffee bean and contributing to forming of bioactive compounds. This finding was observed and need further investigation."

With a continued overload traffic action, a collapse of the hole over the flexible pavement can potentially occur resulting in a pothole on a road surface. Solutions of trapdoor problems are useful for predicting the failure of the hole taking place below the flexible pavement subjected to the overload traffic. In this paper, the collapse pressure on flexible pavements over rectangular trapdoors in homogeneous clay is investigated by a three-dimensional lower bound finite element limit analysis using semidefinite programming. Results of the present study are verified against the existing solutions for the cases of plane strain trapdoors. New lower bound solutions of the problem are numerically derived as functions of cover-depth ratios and aspect ratios of rectangular trapdoors while associated failure mechanisms are discussed and compared. Approximate algebraic equations for stability numbers of rectangular trapdoors are also presented."

This study aimed to investigate the role of this marker in predicting long-term outcome of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) receiving pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-based therapy. Serial serum samples from 91 patients with HBeAg-negative CHB previously treated with PEG-IFN alone or combined with entecavir in a randomized trial were retrospectively analysed. HBV RNA quantification was examined by droplet digital PCR. At the end of 3 years post-treatment follow-up, maintained virological response (MVR, HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance were achieved in 37.4% (34/91) and 7.7% (7/91), respectively. Baseline serum HBV RNA concentrations correlated with HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA but did not correlate with HBsAg levels. Multiple regression analysis showed that pre-treatment HBV RNA and HBsAg were independently associated with MVR and HBsAg clearance. Baseline HBV RNA (cut-off 2.0 log10 copies/mL) had a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value in predicting MVR of 80.8% and 80.0%, respectively. At the same cut-off value, PPV and NPV for predicting HBsAg clearance were 30.8% and 95.4%, respectively. At week 12 during therapy, HBV RNA level ≥ 2 log10 copies/mL displayed high NPVs of achieving MVR and HBsAg clearance (95% and 100%, respectively). In conclusion, the measurement of HBV RNA prior to PEG-IFN-based therapy could identify patients with high probability of MVR. In addition, HBV RNA kinetics may serve as a promising “stopping rule” in patients infected with HBV genotypes B or C."

However, the integration of biosensors is challenging due to limited availability of battery-less biosensor designs. In this work, a combination of nanomaterials for wireless sensing of biological redox reactions is described. The design exploits silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as part of the RFID tag antenna. We demonstrate that a redox enzyme, particularly, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), can convert AgNPs into AgCl in the presence of its substrate, hydrogen peroxide. This strongly changes the impedance of the tag. The presented example exploits gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-assisted electron transfer (ET) between AgNPs and HRP. We show that AuNP is a vital intermediate for establishing rapid ET between the enzyme and AgNPs. As an example, battery-less biosensor-RFID tag designs for H2O2 and glucose are demonstrated. Similar battery-less sensors can be constructed to sense redox reactions catalysed by other oxidoreductase enzymes, their combinations, bacteria or other biological and even non-biological catalysts. In this work, a fast and general route for converting a high number of redox reaction based sensors into battery-less sensor-RFID tags is described."

This study investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled nebulized sodium nitrite in 10 healthy subjects and 8 HbE/β-thal patients with high estimated pulmonary artery pressure. Nitrite pharmacokinetics, fraction exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (eRVSP) measured by echocardiography, and platelet activation were determined. Nebulized sodium nitrite at doses used in this study (37.5 and 75 mg for healthy subjects and 15 mg for HbE/β-thal patients) was well tolerated and did not cause changes in methemoglobin levels and systemic blood pressure. Absorption of inhaled nitrite was rapid with the absolute bioavailability of 18%. In whole blood, nitrite exhibited the dose-independent pharmacokinetics with clearance (CL) of 1.5 l/h/kg, volume of distribution (Vd) of 1.3 l/kg and half-life (t1/2) of 0.6 h. CL and Vd of nitrite was higher in red blood cells (RBC) than whole blood and plasma. HbE/β-thal patients had lower nitrite CL and longer t1/2 in RBC than healthy subjects. FENO increased immediately after inhalation. Following nitrite inhalation, eRVSP remained unchanged but platelet activation was suppressed as evidenced by inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced P-selectin expression and increase in phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (P-VASPSer239) in platelets. There were no changes in markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress after inhalation. Our results support further development of inhaled nebulized sodium nitrite for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in β-thalassemia."

This work, therefore, provides the data required for the modeling and simulation of ZABs. Each set of data includes working time, cell voltage, current, capacity, power, energy, and temperature. The data can be divided into three categories: discharge profiles at different constant currents, dynamic behavior at different step changes of discharge current, and dynamic behavior at different random step changes of discharge current. Constant current discharge profile data focus on the evolution of voltage through time. The data of step changes emphasize the dynamic behavior of voltage responding to the change of discharge current. Besides, the data of random step changes are similar to the data of step changes, but the patterns of step changes are random. Such data support the modeling of a zinc-air battery for both theoretical and empirical approaches."

Few studies have investigated the incidence and risk factors of PNALD in adult patients receiving PN with newer generation intravenous lipid emulsions. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of PNALD in hospitalized adult patients. Methods: Patients expected to receive PN for more than 14 days and have normal liver tests at baseline during September 2016 to February 2017 were enrolled. All patients were followed until there were liver test abnormalities. Incidence, onset and characteristics of PNALD, calories intake, amount of fat and carbohydrate, types of fat, nutrition status, and incidence of infection were evaluated. Results: Forty-four adults were recruited. The incidence of PNALD was 59.1% (22.7% steatosis, 34.1% cholestasis, and 2.3% mixed type). Median onset of PNALD was 12.5 days (range: 4–42) and the onset was not significantly different between each subtype. In multiple regression analysis, severe malnutrition and amount of carbohydrate were independent risk factors for PNALD with an odds ratio of 13.25 (95% CI: 1.37–128.24; p = 0.026) and 21.61 (95% CI: 1.81–258.56; p = 0.015), respectively. Conclusions: PNALD was common in this group of patients. In contrast to previous studies, cholestasis was more common than steatosis, and the median onset was not different between each subtype. In severely malnourished patients, physicians need to exercise caution and monitor for PNALD intensively, and overfeeding of carbohydrate should be avoided to prevent PNALD from occurring."

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdCompatibility tests to identify A, B, and O alleles are critical for establishing suitable donor-recipient matches among experimental animals. Using a qPCR-based SNP probe assay, we have identified A, B, AB, and indeterminate blood group phenotypes in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. We have hypothesized, albeit without molecular confirmation, that the indeterminate phenotype represents homozygosity for the null O allele at the macaque ABO locus. The indeterminate phenotype represents the unsuccessful detection of either A or B alleles using primers targeting the A-specific and B-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a variable region of exon 7 of the ABO locus. These SNPs are associated with two functional sites, detected using two allele-specific probes in the qPCR assay where the codons leucine and methionine (at codon 266) and glycine and alanine (at codon 268) are required for the synthesis of the A and B transferases, respectively. While reference sequences for the A and B alleles exhibited no novel mutations in the functional exon, plasmid Sanger sequence analyses showed unique mutations within the diagnostic target sites in 10 macaques exhibiting the indeterminate phenotype. Eight of these indeterminate individuals exhibited SNPs at codon 268 that should prevent the syntheses of an A or B transferase. While the two other indeterminate samples had functional codons that were consistent with A or B alleles, mutations in either their probe- or primer-binding sites that altered their peptide sequences probably impeded their detection by our assay."

Biological self-healing concrete is a recent alternative technology involving the biochemical reaction of microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). This study determined the most appropriate technique to encapsulate spores of Bacillus sphaericus LMG 22257 with sodium alginate so as to protect the bacterial spores during the concrete mixing and hardening period. Three techniques (extrusion, spray drying and freeze drying) to encapsulate the bacterial spores with sodium alginate were evaluated. The freeze-drying process provided the highest bacterial spore survival rate (100%), while the extruded and spray-dried processes had a lower spore survival rate of 93.8% and 79.9%, respectively. To investigate the viability of microencapsulated spores after being mixed with mortar, the decomposed urea analysis was conducted. The results revealed that the freeze-dried spores also showed the highest level of urea decomposition (metabolic activity assay used as a surrogate marker of spore germination and vegetative cell viability). Thus, the self-healing performance of concrete mixed with freeze-dried spores was evaluated. The results showed that the crack healing ratio observed from the mortar specimens with freeze-dried microencapsulated spores were significantly higher than those without bacteria. This study revealed that freeze drying has a high potential as a microencapsulation technique for application to self-healing concrete technology."

IoT is envisioned as a global network infrastructure consisting of numerous connected devices over the Internet. Many attempts have been made to improve and adapt business workflows for best utilizing IoT services. One possible solution is to digitize and automate internal processes using IoT services, in which Blockchain smart contract is a viable solution to establish the trust of process executions without intermediaries. Modern business processes are composed of disparate services; many of them tend to be delivered based on IoT. Interoperating with such services poses major challenges: 1) time for finality settlement of transactions is unpredictable and usually experiencing delay; 2) several implementations of permissioned Blockchain pose a major concern of trust regarding nodes that perform consensus; and 3) trust of process executions and IoT information is the major factor to the success of modern business processes, which require the composition of distributed IoT services. Traditional business processes are mostly managed by a single entity, which induces the problem of trust of process executions. In this paper, a smart contract for establishing the trust of process executions that fits into the IoT environment is presented. A consensus approach with selected validators extended from Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is introduced to address time and prejudice challenges."

The cockle cultivations of three repeated operating ages (<5 years: S1; 5–10 years: S2; more than 10 years: S3) were selected for the study, and the sampling sites were allocated at the centre of the farm. Results indicated that there were significant differences in species number, individual number and evenness index of benthic macroinvertebrate fauna found in the two sampling seasons (p <.05) and significant differences in individual number and evenness index were found among the sampling sites (p <.05). Significant differences in pH, total phosphorus levels, sulphide levels and organic matter of sediment were found between the sampling seasons (p <.05) and differences in total nitrogen level, organic matter and clay content were found among the sampling sites (p <.05). Among the independent variables analysed, correlation analysis showed no relationship between diversity index, species richness index and evenness index and the abiotic variables (p <.05). The results of the present study suggest that the distribution and diversity variations of the benthic macroinvertebrates community fauna are not affected by all sediment parameters in various repeated cultivation of the blood cockle Anadara granosa in Bandon Bay, Suratthani Province."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Impairment of bone microstructure and upregulation of osteoclastogenic markers in spontaneously hypertensive rats  2019, The Author(s).Hypertension and osteoporosis are the major non-communicable diseases in the elderly worldwide. Although clinical studies reported that hypertensive patients experienced significant bone loss and likelihood of fracture, the causal relationship between hypertension and osteoporosis has been elusive due to other confounding factors associated with these diseases. In this study, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used to address this relationship and further explored the biophysical properties and the underlying mechanisms. Long bones of the hind limbs from 18-week-old female SHR were subjected to determination of bone mineral density (BMD) and their mechanical properties. Using synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM), femoral heads of SHR displayed marked increase in porosity within trabecular area together with decrease in cortical thickness. The volumetric micro-computed tomography also demonstrated significant decreases in trabecular BMD, cortical thickness and total cross-sectional area of the long bones. These changes also led to susceptibility of the long bones to fracture indicated by marked decreases in yield load, stiffness and maximum load using three-point bending tests. At the cellular mechanism, an increase in the expression of osteoclastogenic markers with decrease in the expression of alkaline phosphatase was found in primary osteoblast-enriched cultures isolated from long bones of these SHR suggesting an imbalance in bone remodeling. Taken together, defective bone mass and strength in hypertensive rats were likely due to excessive bone resorption. Development of novel therapeutic interventions that concomitantly target hypertension and osteoporosis should be helpful in reduction of unwanted outcomes, such as bone fractures, in elderly patients."

We evaluated brain perfusion change at 4 h after donepezil administration (4 h DNPZ) to predict cognitive responses after 6 months of medication. CERAD neuropsychological assessment battery was used to define cognitive response at 6 months. We compared 4 h DNPZ to baseline single photon emission tomography (SPECT) by statistical parametric mapping to identify perfusion changes in responders (N = 16) and non-responders (N = 7). In responders, there were significant relatively increase in perfusion in left parietal lobe (BA39, 7, 1), right superior frontal gyrus (BA6) and right middle occipital gyrus (BA39). In the non-responders, perfusion was relatively increase in the left parietal lobe (BA39) only. In an explorative analysis, we found a significant correlation between perfusion changes in right BA6 and CERAD score changes at 6 months. Different SPECT perfusion changes at 4 h after donepezil administration were demonstrated in the group of responders and non-responders with potential correlation with CERAD score change. Thus, 4 h DNPZ brain perfusion SPECT can be used to predict donepezil response at 6 months."

A prospective observational study was conducted in pregnant women at 11–13+6 weeks of pregnancy who had antenatal care at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, between January 2017 and January 2018. Serum SHARP1 measurement and transabdominal Doppler of the uterine artery were performed. The predictive values of these tests were determined. Data were obtained from 405 pregnant women. Thirty-five women had preeclampsia (8.6%), and six of these had early-onset preeclampsia (1.5%). Preeclamptic women had significantly lower serum SHARP1 levels than pregnant women without preeclampsia (3.6 ng/ml vs 4.7 ng/ml, p < 0.01). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of serum SHARP1 levels of less than 3.89 ng/ml for predicting preeclampsia were 77.1%, 72.7%, 21.1% and 97.1%, respectively. For uterine artery Doppler, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the mean pulsatility index (PI) > 95th percentile for predicting preeclampsia were 5.7%, 95.4%, 10.5% and 91.5%, respectively. For the combination of serum SHARP1 levels with a cutoff value of less than 3.89 ng/ml and a mean PI > 95th percentile, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 77.1%, 70.3%, 19.7% and 97.0%, respectively.

However, the merging of distinct genomes also brings together incompatible regulatory networks that must be resolved during the course of evolution. Understanding of the early stages of post-hybridization evolution is particularly important because changes in these stages have long-term evolutionary consequences. Here, via comparative transcriptomic analyses of two closely related, recently hybridized Trichosporon fungi, T. coremiiforme and T. ovoides, and three extant relatives, we show that early post-hybridization evolutionary processes occur separately at the gene sequence and gene expression levels but together contribute to the stabilization of hybrid genome and transcriptome. Our findings also highlight lineage-specific consequences of genome hybridization, revealing that the transcriptional regulatory dynamics in these hybrids responded completely differently to gene loss events: one involving both subgenomes and another that is strictly subgenome-specific."

We conducted a genome-wide analysis of durian (Durio zibethinus Murr.) and identified 24 durian Dofs (DzDofs), 15 of which were expressed in fruit pulp. Gene expression analysis revealed differential expression of DzDofs during ripening in two commercial durian cultivars from Thailand, Monthong and Chanee. Comparing the expression levels of fruit pulp-expressed DzDofs between cultivars revealed ten potential cultivar-dependent Dofs, among which DzDof2.2 showed a significantly greater fold increase at every ripening stage in Chanee than in Monthong. The prediction of DzDof2.2’s function based on its orthologue in Arabidopsis revealed its possible role in regulating auxin biosynthesis. We observed significantly higher auxin levels during ripening of Chanee than Monthong which concurred with the greater expression of auxin biosynthetic genes. Transient expression of DzDof2.2 in Nicotiana benthamiana significantly upregulated the expression levels of auxin biosynthetic genes. Higher expression levels of DzDof2.2 in Chanee would enhance auxin levels through transcriptional regulation of auxin biosynthetic genes. Higher auxin levels in Chanee could activate auxin-mediated transcription, contributing to its faster ripening compared to Monthong through earlier initiation of the ethylene response (auxin-ethylene crosstalk)."

Design: Retrospective analysis of cohort study data. Methods: Participants were identified from the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases Cohort Study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained via medical record review. The study included 352 patients who were taking single-agent immunosuppression with MTX or MMF at 4 tertiary uveitis clinics. Marginal structural models (MSM)-derived statistical weighting created a virtual population with covariates and censoring patterns balanced across alternative treatments. With this methodological approach, the results estimate what would have happened had none of the patients stopped their treatment. Survival analysis with stabilized MSM-derived weights simulated a clinical trial comparing MMF vs MTX for noninfectious inflammatory eye disorders. The primary outcome was complete control of inflammation on prednisone ≤10 mg/day, sustained for ≥30 days. Results: The time to success was shorter (more favorable) for MMF than MTX (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.99). Adjusting for covariates, the proportion achieving success was higher at every point in time for MMF than MTX from 2 to 8 months, then converges at 9 months. The onset of corticosteroid-sparing success took more than 3 months for most patients in both groups. Outcomes of treatment (MMF vs MTX) were similar across all anatomic sites of inflammation. The incidence of stopping therapy for toxicity was similar in both groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, on average, MMF may be faster than MTX in achieving corticosteroid-sparing success in ocular inflammatory diseases."

We synthesized previously a succinate ester prodrug of Cur, curcumin diethyl disuccinate (CurDD) with better chemical stability in a buffer solution pH 7.4. Here, we further investigated and compared the cellular transport and anti-proliferative activity against HepG2 cells of CurDD and Cur. Transport of CurDD across the Caco-2 monolayers provided a significantly higher amount of the bioavailable fraction (BF) of Cur with better cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells compared to that of Cur (p < 0.05). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the BF of CurDD shifted the cell fate to early and late apoptosis to a higher extent than that of Cur. The Western blot analysis revealed that CurDD increased Bax protein expression, downregulated Bcl-2 protein, activated caspase-3 and -9 and increased LC3-II protein level in HepG2 cells. Flow cytometric and immunoblotting results suggest that CurDD can induce HepG2 cell death via an apoptotic pathway. We suggest that CurDD can overcome the limitations of Cur in terms of cellular transport with a potential for further extensive in vitro and in vivo studies of anti-hepatocellular carcinoma effects."

The physiochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by using inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–Vis spectroscopy, N2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), PL spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic activities of all the catalysts were studied via the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O to CH4 under UV light irradiation. The Cu/TiO2 catalysts exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the uncoated TiO2 supports and the ones made using an impregnation technique. The electron trapping of copper species, which prolonged the electron-hole recombination process, promoted photocatalytic activity of the Cu-doped catalysts. Moreover, the specific morphologies of the Cu species deposited on TiO2 supports and the smaller change of bandgap energy of the sputter coated catalysts also resulted in an improvement of photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation."

However, the biological role of FAM83H remains unclear. The present study aimed to characterize the alveolar bone cells isolated from a patient with ADHCAI having the mutation, c.1261G > T, p.E421*, in FAM83H. We showed that FAM83H mutant cells had proliferation ability and morphology similar to the controls. The F-actin staining revealed that FAM83H mutant cells were remained in the earlier stages of cell spreading compared to the controls at 30 min, but their spreading was advanced comparable to the controls at later stages. After osteogenic induction, a significant decrease in mRNA levels of RUNX2 and ALP was observed in FAM83H mutant cells at day 7 compared with day 3 while their expressions were increased in the controls. The OPN levels in FAM83H mutant cells were not significantly changed at day 7 compared to day 3 while the controls showed a significant increase. After 14 days, the mineral deposition of FAM83H mutant cells was slightly lower than that of the controls. In conclusion, we identify that FAM83H bone cells have lower expression of osteogenic marker genes and mineralization while they maintain their morphology, proliferation, and spreading. Consistent with previous studies in the ameloblasts and periodontal ligamental cells, these evidences propose that FAM83H influences osteogenic differentiation across different cell types in oral cavity."

The authors report a case of a pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland that expands the spectrum of appearances that myoepithelial cells can show with this tumor. A 55-year-old female was found to have a right parotid gland mass. FNA showed hypercellularity, with loosely cohesive fragments of spindle-shaped myoepithelial cells admixed with small nests of epithelial cells. Interspersed may occasional bizarre cells possessing severely pleomorphic nuclei with hyperchromasia. The cytologic diagnosis was “suspicious for carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.” A total parotidectomy was performed with complete resection of the tumor that was confirmed to be a pleomorphic adenoma. The pleomorphic cells noted on FNA were scattered throughout the tumor, and were positive by immunostaining for keratin, S-100 protein and p63, identifying them as myoepithelial cells. These cells did not show mitotic activity and were negative for Ki67. The pleomorphic adenoma showed extensive degenerative changes including central cyst formation, stromal hyalinization and hemosiderin deposition. On the basis of the combined light microscopic and immunohistochemical findings, there was no evidence to support a malignant change in the pleomorphic adenoma. It was concluded the pleomorphic myoepithelial cells were a degenerative change, reminiscent of what is seen in “ancient” schwannoma and some uterine leiomyomata. Our case expands the spectrum of appearances that can be seen in myoepithelial cells in the salivary gland."

Enhanced H2 production in suspension culture was obtained when adapting the cells under N2-fixing condition (modified AA medium) with continuous illumination of 250 μmol photons m−2 s−1 under aerobic condition for 24 h, followed by further incubation under anaerobic condition for 9 h for production phase. The maximum H2 production rate was 38.5 μmol mg−1 chl a h−1. Low concentration of Fe2+ and Mo6+, essential elements for nitrogenase, enhanced H2 production. The enhanced H2 production was accompanied by the upregulation of nifD. On the other hand, an increased hupL transcript level was observed when there was a decrease of H2 production. In cells immobilization, 1.5% (w/v) agar-immobilized cells had a 23-fold increase in maximum H2 yield compared with that using free cell suspension at the same cell concentration, i.e., 7.48 mmol H2 L−1 by immobilized cells and 0.32 mmol H2 L−1 by suspended cells. Moreover, cell immobilization in agar could prolong H2 production up to 108 h. This study underlines the strategies toward enhanced and sustained H2 production from cyanobacteria. Furthermore, it will pave the way for large-scale production of biohydrogen to be used as an eco-friendly energy resource."

Two-point simplified equations for calculating AUC based on serum peak concentrations (Cpeak) and Ctrough, named equation A (EqA) and equation B (EqB), have recently been adopted into clinical use for adult pediatric patients. We aimed to find the agreement between predicted AUC24 using the reference method (ref) relative to EqA and EqB and the correlation between Ctrough and AUC24. From June to December 2018, 43 pediatric patients with normal renal function, receiving 15 mg/kg of vancomycin intravenously every 6 hours, were enrolled. The pediatric patients’ median age was 2.2 years (range 0.1-15.3). At steady state, vancomycin Cpeak and Ctrough were measured at 2 hours after infusion completion and within 30 minutes before the next dosing, respectively. AUC24 was estimated using ref, EqA, and EqB. From Bland-Altman analysis, the 2 AUC24s estimated by ref and EqA showed less bias than those estimated by ref and EqB (bias 1.3 and –72.1 mg⋅h/L, respectively). Ctrough and AUC24 using either ref or EqA were correlated more closely (r2 = 0.94) than with EqB (r2 = 0.86). Assuming a vancomycin MIC of 1 mg/L, an AUC24 ≥400 mg⋅h/L was targeted. Regardless of the method used, AUC24 ≥400 mg⋅h/L was never seen with Ctrough <8 mg/L but was always seen with Ctrough >10 mg/L. In conclusion, EqA based on the 2 measured serum concentrations was sufficiently accurate for AUC24 estimation. Ctrough >10 mg/L correlated highly to AUC24 ≥400 mg⋅h/L."

This chronic pain condition affects the trigeminal nerve, also known as the 5th cranial nerve. Antiseizure drugs are the main biomedical treatment of TN. However, TN is not the only source of chronic facial pain (CFP). Background persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) is also a chronic disorder. The underlying pathophysiologies of TN and PIFP are still unknown. Occlusal equilibration appliance (OEA) will stop bruxism by relaxing all mastication muscle especially, The Lateral Pterygoid muscle. The posterior trunk of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve normally descends deep to the lateral pterygoid muscle. In three of 52 dissections the three branches of the posterior trunk were observed to pass through the medial fiber of the lower belly of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Case description: A 70 year-old Thai female with left facial pain was diagnosed by a neurologist with TN 4 years prior to seeking occlusal equilibration. The cause of facial pain was treated with occlusal equilibration appliance. Conclusion: A complete dissipation of pain was achieved after using occlusal equilibration appliance for 2 weeks and 3 days. The present article is the one of the first to demonstrate the efficacy of occlusal equilibration appliance treatment for chronic facial pain. As the present article shows, OEA treatment affects TN and CFP successfully. However, additional large-scale studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of OEA in TN and CFP treatment."

To overcome these limitations, universal vaccine strategies that aim at eliciting broadly protective antibodies to conserved epitopes of the hemagglutinin show promise for protecting against diverse and drifted influenza viruses. Here a vaccination strategy that focuses antibody responses to conserved epitopes of the H3 hemagglutinin is described. The approach is based on antigenic silencing of the immunodominant major antigenic sites of an H3 protein from 2014 by replacing them with corresponding sequences of exotic avian hemagglutinins, yielding “mosaic” hemagglutinins. In mice, vaccination with inactivated viruses expressing mosaic hemagglutinins induced highly cross-reactive antibodies against the H3 stalk domain that elicited Fc-mediated effector functions in vitro. In addition, the mosaic viruses elicited head-specific antibodies with neutralizing and hemagglutination-inhibiting activity against recent H3N2 viruses in vitro. Immune sera protected mice from heterologous challenge with viruses carrying H3 proteins from 1968 and 1982, whereas immune sera generated with a seasonal vaccine did not protect. Consequently, the mosaic vaccination approach provides a promising avenue toward a universal influenza virus vaccine."

Xylitol and sorbitol, which are naturally occurring sugar alcohols (polyols) found in many fruits and vegetables, exhibit the potential caries-reducing effect and are widely used for diabetic patients as low-calorie sweeteners. In the present study, computational tools were applied to investigate the structural details of binary complexes formed between these two polyols and the T1R2-T1R3 heterodimeric STR. Principal component analysis revealed that the Venus flytrap domain (VFD) of T1R2 monomer was adapted by the induced-fit mechanism to accommodate the focused polyols, in which α-helical residues 233–268 moved significantly closer to stabilize ligands. This finding likely suggested that these structural transformations might be the important mechanisms underlying polyols-STR recognitions. The calculated free energies also supported the VFD of T1R2 monomer as the preferential binding site for such polyols, rather than T1R3 region, in accord with the lower number of accessible water molecules in the T1R2 pocket. The E302 amino acid residue in T1R2 was found to be the important recognition residue for polyols binding through a strongly formed hydrogen bond. Additionally, the binding affinity of xylitol toward the T1R2 monomer was significantly higher than that of sorbitol, making it a sweeter tasting molecule."

Therefore, a dataset of schistosome targets is necessary for drug development. Phosphorylation regulates signalling pathways to control cellular processes that are important for the parasite’s growth and reproduction. Inhibition of key phosphoproteins may reduce the severity of schistosomiasis. In this research, we studied the phosphoproteomes of S. mekongi male and female adult worms by using computational and experimental approaches. Using a phosphoproteomics approach, we determined that 88 and 44 phosphoproteins were male- and female-biased, respectively. Immunohistochemistry using anti-phosphoserine antibodies demonstrated phosphorylation on the tegument and muscle of male S. mekongi worms and on the vitelline gland and gastrointestinal tract of female worms.

The cellulase was found to be approximately 55 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Using CMC as a substrate, the specific activity of the cellulase was 62.9 units (U) mg−1 with Vmax and Km values of 37.87 mol min−1 mg−1 and 3.02 mg mL−1, respectively. Characterization of the enzyme revealed it to be an extremozyme, having an optimum activity at pH 10, 60 °C, and 200 g L−1 of NaCl. The enzyme activity was not significantly altered by the addition of divalent metal cations at 2 mM and neither did ß-mercaptoethanol, while EDTA was found strongly inhibiting the cellulase. Compared with commercial cellulase, the purified cellulase from A. flavus was more active in the extremity of conditions, especially at pH 10, 60 °C, and 150 g L−1 NaCl, whereas the commercial cellulase had a very low activity."

The new diluent, which has a branched-chain structure, increased the extraction performance of the OH-aliquat up to 50% HSS removal from MEA solution compared to our previous straight-chained 1-octanol diluent. The extractant also performed very well in removing HSS from MDEA and AMP with the ease of HSS extraction increasing in the order of AMP < MEA < MDEA for which the oxalate was removed by nearly 100% regardless of the type of amine and concentration. In blended MEA, AMP and MDEA, the extractant had a higher chemical affinity in removing all HSS when compared with single MEA. The extractant could also remove major neutral degradation products found in MEA solution. High temperature and low CO2 loading conditions were found to be favorable in maximizing the ability of the extractant to remove both product types. This finding revealed that the exact location where the amine slipstream should be taken for simultaneous extraction of all degradation products is at the exit point of the lean-rich amine heat exchanger. The regeneration of extractant using sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) also indicated the reusability of the extractant as long as its reactive molecules remained. The results obtained from this study are being used for further development of the extraction process that can be used as a permanent replacement for conventional reclaiming techniques."

In addition to a set of well-known determinants, the patient’s health insurance status could also influence the prescription practice. Purpose: Although many guidelines suggest using anti-osteoporosis medications in patients who suffered from fragility hip fractures, low rate of prescription was encountered all over the world. In this study, we aimed to explore potential determinants affecting the prescription of anti-osteoporosis medications by orthopedic surgeons. Materials and methods: Online questionnaire survey was conducted among randomly selected orthopedic surgeons in Thailand. We inquired the factors associated with anti-osteoporosis medication prescription (likely to prescribe, unlikely to prescribe, or not influential). The reasons for not prescribing were also inquired. Results: Two hundred and ninety-four participants responded to the questionnaires. Age, gender, previous fragility fracture, and BMD results seemed to influence the medication prescription. Interestingly, the type of reimbursement was responded as an important factor. The leading reason for not prescribing the medication was due to the high cost of the treatment. Conclusions: Knowing the factors affecting the prescription of anti-osteoporosis medication is beneficial for strategic planning in order to increase the rate of prescription. The gap of treatment may be reduced, and the morbidity and mortality of the patients can be decreased."

One of the factors that affect efficacy of PRF is the concentration of the incorporated cytokines. However, there is inadequate information regarding PRF preservation. Thus, this study was conducted to build on the knowledge in canine study regarding cytokine concentration and also the effect of storage condition. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and vascular endothelial growth factor subunit A (VEGF-A) in canine’s blood (n = 10) using advanced PRF plus technique were determined by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 3 different time points; immediately (baseline), 7 days after storage at − 20 °C, and 14 days after storage at − 20 °C. Data on concentration at each time points were compared. The result revealed a pattern of time-dependent decay; TGF-β1 decreased from 171.50 ng/ml (at baseline) to 125.8 ng/ml (day 7) and 88.9 ng/ml (day 14), VEGF-A decreased from 88.21 pg/ml (at baseline) to 70.82 pg/ml (day 7) and 63.44 pg/ml (day 14). These findings indicated that PRF provided the highest cytokine concentration while used promptly after preparation."

Optimizing system performance is becoming a great challenge for an ever-increasing large-scale distributed application system in the digital economy on the Internet of Things (IoT) era. In a centralized BPM, many indicators, such as security and openness, or cost and flexibility, are conflicting with each other. For example, inviting new partners across enterprises, domains, and regions to form a service workflow exposes new risks and needs additional security mechanisms for scrutiny; enhancing the flexibility of business workflow compositions increases the cost of security assurance. Blockchain technology (BCT) has thrown the light on the development of vital solutions to various BPM problems. BCT has to be integrated with other BPM system components that often involve IoT devices to implement specified functionalities related to the application. Currently, the potentials of using BCT have been explored although still at an early stage. In this paper, the states of the art are presented to identify emerging research topics, challenges, and promising applications in integrating BCT into the development of BPM."

The traditional mechanisms for QoS measurements rely on the centralized trusted third parties who use specialized agents to collect data and measure the performances of services. However, these mechanisms are ineffective to deal with highly dynamic and distributed nature of IoT-based services. Moreover, the dynamism of QoS needs to collect, update, and access reliable quality relevant data frequently, while lacking trust becomes a major hurdle for data utilization. It is our argument that the QoS measurement of IoT-based services would be decentralized and the trusts be built from collectively trusted subnetworks. In this paper, we propose to integrate the blockchain technologies (BCT) with a multi-agent approach to warrantee the trustiness of real-time data for the measurement of QoS in the IoT environment. The proposed approach is verified by some demonstrative examples in addressing QoS specification patterns commonly found in service-based applications (SBAs), where qualitative analyses are conducted for the evaluation of the patterns."

PCC6803 was engineered by interrupting the α-ketoglutarate decarboxylase (KGD) and overexpressing the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) pathways to create ∆Kgd, GADox, and GADox/∆Kgd mutants with the aim to enhance GABA accumulation. Supplementation of 20 mM glutamate or 0.5 mM spermidine increased the GABA contents by several folds in engineered strains. Supplementation of glutamate not only increased the GABA accumulation of cells but also improved the growth rates of engineered strains, signifying that the GAD pathway plays a crucial role in maintaining the intracellular glutamate homeostasis in Synechocystis. The high GABA level was detected in GADox/∆Kgd grown in 0.1% glucose-supplemented medium, ~ 240-folds higher than that in WT grown without glucose. Overall results suggested that the optimization of carbon and nitrogen sources was effective in enhancing the GABA accumulation in Synechocystis overexpressing the GAD and lacking the functional KGD pathway. This work provides an insight into the strategy to improve GABA production in cyanobacteria and possibly in plants as well."

Predominant pollen was identified. Results characterising antioxidant properties (DPPH radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and carbon-centred radicals scavenging activity) were confirmed via both Electron Spinning Resonance and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). They showed that only hydroxyl radicals scavenging activity and ORAC were significantly different. Type and amount of phenolics in honey samples identified using HPLC could differentiate botanical source. Gallic acid and kaempferol were potential marker phenolics for longan honey. Multivariate statistical analysis allowed discrimination of honey from different botanical sources based on their phenolic profiles."
['Multidisciplinary'],"δ-MnO2 nanoflower/graphite cathode for rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries  2019, The Author(s).Manganese oxide (MnO2) is one of the most promising intercalation cathode materials for zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). Specifically, a layered type delta manganese dioxide (δ-MnO2) allows reversible insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions and exhibits high storage capacity of Zn2+ ions. However, a poor conductivity of δ-MnO2, as well as other crystallographic forms, limits its potential applications. This study focuses on δ-MnO2 with nanoflower structure supported on graphite flake, namely MNG, for use as an intercalation host material of rechargeable aqueous ZIBs. Pristine δ-MnO2 nanoflowers and MNG were synthesized and examined using X-ray diffraction, electron spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. Also, performances of the batteries with the pristine δ-MnO2 nanoflowers and MNG cathodes were studied in CR2032 coin cells. MNG exhibits a fast insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions with diffusion scheme and pseudocapacitive behavior. The battery using MNG cathode exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 235 mAh/g at 200 mA/g specific current density compared to 130 mAh/g which is displayed by the pristine δ-MnO2 cathode at the same specific current density. MNG demonstrated superior electrical conductivity compared to the pristine δ-MnO2. The results obtained pave the way for improving the electrical conductivity of MnO2 by using graphite flake support. The graphite flake support significantly improved performances of ZIBs and made them attractive for use in a wide variety of energy applications."

A recent review found no strong evidence for improvement of cognitive function, suggesting negative results were due to limitations in dose, standardization and product variation. We used a standardized extract of C. asiatica (ECa 233) to study behavioral, cellular and molecular effects on learning and memory enhancement. ECa 233 (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg) was given orally to normal rats twice a day for 30 days. We used the Morris water maze to test spatial learning and performed acute brain slice recording to measure changes of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a core brain region for memory formation. Plasticity-related protein expressions (NR2A, NR2B, PSD-95, BDNF and TrkB) in hippocampus was also measured. Rats receiving 10 and 30 mg/kg doses showed significantly enhanced memory retention, and hippocampal long-term potentiation; however, only the 30 mg/kg dose showed increased plasticity-related proteins. There was an inverted U-shaped response of ECa 233 on memory enhancement; 30 mg/kg maximally enhanced memory retention with an increase of synaptic plasticity and plasticity-related proteins in hippocampus. Our data clearly support the beneficial effect on memory retention of a standardized extract of Centella asiatica within a specific therapeutic range."

Here, we used the draft Artemia transcriptome database to search for other genes in the HSP70 family. Four novel HSP70 genes were identified and designated heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), heat shock 70 kDa cognate 5 (HSC70-5), Immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BIP), and hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 (HYOU1). For each of these genes, we obtained nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, and reconstructed a phylogenetic tree. Expression analysis revealed that in the juvenile state, the transcription of HSP70 and HSC70 was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in a population of A. franciscana selectively bred for increased induced thermotolerance (TF12) relative to a control population (CF12). Following non-lethal heat shock treatment at the nauplius stage, transcription of HSP70, HSC70, and HSC70-5 were significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated in TF12. In contrast, transcription of the other HSP70 family members in A. franciscana (BIP, HYOU1, and HSPA4) showed no significant (P > 0.05) induction. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that not all members of the HSP70 family are involved in the response to heat stress and selection and that especially altered expression of HSC70 plays a role in a population selected for increased thermotolerance."

Sergentomyia gemmea has been suspected several times to transmit Leishmania martiniquensis. Some captures carried out in Thailand and Lao People's Democratic Republic have emphasized the scarcity of Se. gemmea, comprising only 1% of the collected females. The sequencing of cytochrome B mtDNA of our specimens showed that our specimens are not grouped with other Se. gemmea previously deposited in GenBank. The latter are grouped with some Se. khawi and Se. hivernus that we processed in the present study. We suspect misidentifications and propose focusing on the most useful characters for identification of Se. gemmea based on the examination of type-specimens. The examination of the ascoids exhibiting anterior spurs is the most important one. However, we also describe Se. raynali n. sp. exhibiting comparable spurs but differing from Se. gemmea by its original cibarium. Finally, the vectorial role of Se. gemmea appears very questionable in the absence of new evidence."

Using account-level loan data to study the impact of Thailand’s first-car-buyer tax rebate scheme at both individual and postcode levels, we find that the program led to higher loan delinquency and crowded out other loan originations, which are symptoms implied by excessive debt burden. The adverse impacts were more pronounced for passenger car buyers than for truck buyers and there were local negative spillovers to non-participants. Our findings raise questions about the merit of promoting economic growth by inducing debt-fueled spending and suggest that the design of durable goods stimulus policy should focus more on productive business durables than on consumer durables."

PCC 6803 assimilates carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source, and a major portion of the assimilated carbon is metabolically consumed by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Effects of partial interference of TCA cycle metabolic activity on other carbon metabolism have yet to be examined. Here, the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt, one of the metabolic pathways for completing TCA cycle in Synechocystis, was disrupted via inactivating the glutamate decarboxylase gene (gdc). Under normal photoautotrophic condition, cell growth and the level of the TCA cycle metabolites succinate, malate and citrate were decreased by 25%, 35%, 19% and 28%, respectively, in Δgdc mutant relative to those in the wild type (WT). The cellular levels of glycogen and total lipids of the Δgdc mutant were comparable to those of the WT, but the intracellular levels of pyruvate and bioplastic poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) were 1.23- and 2.50-fold higher, respectively, in Δgdc mutant. Thus, disruption of the GABA shunt pathway reduced the TCA cycle metabolites levels, but positively enhanced the bioaccumulation of pyruvate and PHB. The PHB production rate in Δgdc mutant was 2.0-fold higher than in the WT under normal photoautotrophy."

Theoretical calculations imply that the introduction of Mo2C produces a graphene wave structure, which in some senses behaves like N doping to form localized charges. Being an active electrocatalyst, MoNCs demonstrate a Tafel slope as low as 60.6 mV dec−1 and high durability of up to 10 h in acidic media. Besides charge engineering, plentiful defects and hierarchical morphology also contribute to good performance.

In this report, we describe current trends in HSCT throughout the Asia-Pacific region and differences among nations in this region and various global registries. Since 2008, more than 10,000 HSCTs have been recorded each year by the Asia-Pacific Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group Data Center. Between 2005 and 2015, the greatest increase in the number of HSCTs was observed in Vietnam. Allogeneic HSCT was performed more frequently than autologous HSCT, and a majority of cases involved related donors. Regarding allogeneic HSCT, the use of cord blood has remained steady, especially in Japan, and the number of cases involving related HLA non-identical donors has increased rapidly, particularly in China. The incidence of hemoglobinopathy, a main indication for allogeneic HSCT in India, China, Iran, and Pakistan, increased nearly six-fold over the last decade. Among the 18 participating countries/regions, the transplant rate per population varied widely according to the absolute number of HSCTs and the national/regional population size. We believe that this report will not only benefit the AP region but will also provide information about HSCT to other regions worldwide."

Delimiting species in widespread taxa is an intriguing problem; the edible operculated land snail Cyclophorus volvulus (Müller, 1774) is a good example since it shows a high degree of shell and color variation along with a widespread distribution throughout Thailand. Taxonomic boundaries for C. volvulus were examined and clarified using a combined morphological and phylogenetic approach, the latter of which was based on both nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences. Moreover, three species delimitation analyses were applied: Poisson tree processes (PTP), automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD), and generalized mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC). All phylogenetic trees revealed that C. volvulus was polyphyletic and comprised of three clades that coincided with their geographic distribution. The three species delimitation analyses concurred with the phylogenies and formed at least three groups. According to the results, C. volvulus s.l., as currently recognized, consists of three distinct species in Thailand: C. volvulus s.s., C. occultus sp. nov., and C. borealis sp. nov., which are described herein.

Assessing antibiotics on planktonic bacteria can result in failure against biofilm infections. Currently, antibiotics to treat biofilm infections are administered empirically, usually without considering the susceptibility of the biofilm objectively before beginning treatment. For effective therapy to resolve biofilm infections it is essential to assess the efficacy of commonly used antibiotics against biofilms. Here, we offer a robust and simple assay to assess the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilms. In the present work, we carefully optimized the incubation time, detection range, and fluorescence reading mode for resazurin-based viability staining of biofilms in 96-well-plates and determined minimal biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) for A. baumannii isolates from patients with chronic infection. By applying this assay, we demonstrated that antibiotic response patterns varied uniquely within the biofilm formation of various clinical samples. MBEC-50 and 75 have significant discriminatory power over minimum inhibitory concentrations for planktonic suspensions to differentiate the overall efficiency of an antibiotic to eradicate a biofilm. The present assay is an ideal platform on which to assess the efficacy of antibiotics against biofilms in vitro to pave the way for more effective therapy."

However, the hypercoagulable state, as well as the molecular mechanism of this aspect of the pathogenesis of β-thalassemia/HbE, remains poorly understood. To address this issue, fifteen non-splenectomized β-thalassemia/HbE patients, 8 splenectomized β-thalassemia/HbE patients and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited to this study. Platelet activation and hypercoagulable parameters including levels of CD62P and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 were analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. A proteomic analysis was conducted to compare the platelet proteome between patients and normal subjects, and the results were validated by western blot analysis. The β-thalassemia/HbE patients showed significantly higher levels of CD62P and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 than normal subjects. The levels of platelet activation and hypercoagulation found in patients were strongly associated with splenectomy status. The platelet proteome analysis revealed 19 differential spots which were identified to be 19 platelet proteins, which included 10 cytoskeleton proteins, thrombin generation related proteins, and antioxidant enzymes. Our findings highlight markers of coagulation activation and molecular pathways known to be associated with the pathogenesis of platelet activation, the hypercoagulable state, and consequently with the thrombosis observed in β-thalassemia/HbE patients."

Meanwhile, postoperative topical steroid decreases the downtime, yet still possibly increases other steroid side effects. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moisturizer containing 5% panthenol, madecassoside, and copper-zinc-manganese (experimental cream) versus 0.02% Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) cream in decreasing adverse effects and downtime after FrCO2 laser, with wound healing improvement and prevention of certain steroid-related side effects like postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Methods: We conducted a double-blinded, split face, randomized controlled trial in 20 subjects receiving FrCO2 laser on both sides of the faces and randomly treated with two posttreatment regimens on each side for 7 days. Clinical, expert panel assessment of photography, downtime, side effects, and biometric evaluation for erythema and melanin were performed on baseline, immediately after treatment, day 3, 5, 7, 14, 30 and, 60 postoperatively. Results: Both experimental cream (EC) and 0.02% TA cream could significantly reduce postlaser downtime including swelling, redness, crusting, and scaling in 5-7 days, with comparable efficacies in decreasing downtime and adverse reactions, as well as wound healing improvement and lower PIH without statistically significant difference between the two treatments. The incidence of PIH was 60% in the EC treated group with minimal intensity. Conclusion: The moisturizer with anti-inflammatory ingredients could be a novel treatment modality for reduction of postablative laser downtime by using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents to avoid adverse effects and improve wound healing process with lower PIH."

We find that increases in traded-sector productivity in Asian emerging and developing countries have a positive effect on economic growth and international trade for most countries.
['Multidisciplinary'],"Halve the dose while maintaining image quality in paediatric Cone Beam CT  2019, The Author(s).Cone beam CT (CBCT) for dentomaxillofacial paediatric assessment has been widely used despite the uncertainties of the risks of the low-dose radiation exposures. The aim of this work was to investigate the clinical performance of different CBCT acquisition protocols towards the optimization of paediatric exposures. Custom-made anthropomorphic phantoms were scanned using a CBCT unit in six protocols. CT slices were blinded, randomized and presented to three observers, who scored the image quality using a 4-point scale along with their level of confidence. Sharpness level was also measured using a test object containing an air/PMMA e,dge. The effective dose was calculated by means of a customized Monte Carlo (MC) framework using previously validated paediatric voxels models. The results have shown that the protocols set with smaller voxel size (180 µm), even when decreasing exposure parameters (kVp and mAs), showed high image quality scores and increased sharpness. The MC analysis showed a gradual decrease in effective dose when exposures parameters were reduced, with an emphasis on an average reduction of 45% for the protocol that combined 70 kVp, 16 mAs and 180 µm voxel size. In contrast, both “ultra-low dose” protocols that combined a larger voxel size (400 µm) with lower mAs (7.4 mAs) demonstrated the lowest scores with high levels of confidence unsuitable for an anatomical approach. In conclusion, a significant decrease in the effective dose can be achieved while maintaining the image quality required for paediatric CBCT."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Vertical transmission of Zika virus in Culex quinquefasciatus Say and Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes  2019, The Author(s). Several mosquito species have been described as vectors for the Zika virus (ZIKV), such as those in the Aedes, Anopheles, Mansonia and Culex genera. Our previous survey studies were found the ZIKV RNA positive in both male, female and larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus Say and Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes collected from active ZIKV infected patients’ homes in Thailand. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate whether ZIKV could be vertically transmitted in Cx. quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Laboratory and field colonies of these mosquito species were maintained and artificially fed with ZIKV in human blood. Fully engorged mosquitoes (F 0 ) were selected and reared for the vertical transmission study. The subsequent mosquito generations were fed with human blood without the virus. ZIKV in the mosquitoes was detected by hemi-nested RT-PCR and sequencing. C6/36 cells were used to isolate ZIKV from samples that tested positive by hemi-nested RT-PCR. Moreover, ZIKV was identified by immunocytochemical staining 7 days after infection in several organs of infected F 0 females, including the salivary glands, midguts, yoke granules and facet cells of the eye. The localization of the ZIKV antigen was identified by the presence of the specific antibody in the salivary glands, midguts, yoke granules and facet cells. ZIKV was detected in female and male Cx. quinquefasciatus until the F 6 and F 2 generations, respectively. The isolated virus showed cytopathic effects in C6/36 cells by 5 days postinfection. The results suggested that the vertical transmission of ZIKV occurs in Cx. quinquefasciatus in the laboratory. However, we were able to detect the presence of ZIKV in Ae. aegypti in only the F 1 generation in both male and female mosquitoes, and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were not able to vertically transmit the virus at all. Data obtained from this study could be valuable for developing a better understanding of the role of Cx. quinquefasciatus as a potential vector for ZIKV transmission in Thailand and may be useful in creating more effective mosquito vector control strategies in the future."

Objective: This study investigated the arterial anastomosis between the submental and sublingual arteries that can lead to the emboli and subsequent tongue infarction during chin augmentation. Methods: Forty-two formaldehyde-embalmed cadavers and four soft-embalmed cadavers were dissected to verify the incidence and source of the ascending mental artery. Ultrasonographic study of the artery was performed in 10 healthy volunteers. Attention was paid to discriminate whether the ascending mental artery arose from the submental artery or the sublingual artery using the arch of the mylohyoid muscle as the discriminating landmark. Results: Incidence of ascending mental artery from the sublingual artery was 7.1% in the studied population. All ascending mental arteries were 0.7 ± 0.2 mm in diameter at the mental protuberance and were branches of the submental artery that arose from the facial artery, except for two arteries that arose from the sublingual artery. Ultrasonographic study revealed that one left and one right sublingual artery from the lingual arteries penetrated the mylohyoid muscle near the midline to become the ascending mental artery in two volunteers. The ascending mental artery from the other side continued from the submental artery. Conclusion: Findings from the cadaveric dissections and ultrasonographic study revealed that the ascending mental artery may be a branch that continues from the lingual artery, or communicates with the sublingual artery through the mouth floor."

Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) by synthetic agonists was found to improve cognition in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mice. However, these LXR agonists induce hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis, hampering their use in the clinic. We hypothesized that phytosterols as LXR agonists enhance cognition in AD without affecting plasma and hepatic triglycerides. Phytosterols previously reported to activate LXRs were tested in a luciferase-based LXR reporter assay. Using this assay, we found that phytosterols commonly present in a Western type diet in physiological concentrations do not activate LXRs. However, a lipid extract of the 24(S)-Saringosterol-containing seaweed Sargassum fusiforme did potently activate LXRβ. Dietary supplementation of crude Sargassum fusiforme or a Sargassum fusiforme-derived lipid extract to AD mice significantly improved short-term memory and reduced hippocampal Aβ plaque load by 81%. Notably, none of the side effects typically induced by full synthetic LXR agonists were observed. In contrast, administration of the synthetic LXRα activator, AZ876, did not improve cognition and resulted in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver. Administration of Sargassum fusiforme-derived 24(S)-Saringosterol to cultured neurons reduced the secretion of Aβ 42 . Moreover, conditioned medium from 24(S)-Saringosterol-treated astrocytes added to microglia increased phagocytosis of Aβ. Our data show that Sargassum fusiforme improves cognition and alleviates AD pathology. This may be explained at least partly by 24(S)-Saringosterol-mediated LXRβ activation."

Being stigmatized can result in depression, which can negatively impact antiretroviral medication adherence. This quasi-experimental research study aimed to examine the effects of cognitive-behavioral group therapy using art as a medium on depressive symptoms and medication adherence. Forty-six MSM were assigned (23 × 2) either to a weekly 2-h art-based CBGT group session for a total of 8 weeks or to a no-intervention control group. The experimental group of 23 met in 4 separate small groups. Pre-intervention period analyses indicated no significant differences between the two groups in the key variables examined, together with demographic information including the participants’ ages, education levels, and CD4 (T cells) levels. Measures of depressive symptoms and antiretroviral medication adherence were administered pre- and post-intervention. Using MANOVA, findings suggested that depressive symptom scores among the intervention group were reduced significantly post-treatment (p <.01) and were significantly lower than those of the control group (p <.001). Scores among the experimental group for medication adherence increased significantly pre- to post-treatment (p <.025); however, post-treatment scores were not significantly different between the experimental and control groups. These findings provide initial evidence for the potential effectiveness of art-based CBGT in alleviating depressive symptoms and enhancing antiretroviral medication adherence in MSM with HIV."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Genetic and evolutionary analysis of a new Asia-4 lineage and naturally recombinant canine distemper virus strains from Thailand  2019, The Author(s).Canine distemper virus (CDV), a pathogen causing fatal disease in a wide range of carnivores, can be classified into several geographically-related lineages. It is unclear how genetic recombination contributed to the evolution and emergence of the novel CDV strains and the evolutions of these strains are not fully yet investigated. In this study, the complete genome sequences of eight CDV viruses, isolated from domestic dogs in Thailand, were investigated. Interestingly, most of the identified CDV strains (CDV1-3, -5, -8 TH/2014) clustered as a novel Asia-4 lineage, while the CDV4, -6, -7 TH/2014 belonged to the Asia-1 lineage. Recombination analysis revealed that the CDV4 TH/2014 is a putative recombinant virus from the Asia-1 and America-2 parent viruses. In contrast, no recombination events were detected in the Asia-4 lineage, indicating that it is a distinctive lineage. Evolutionary analysis suggested that the CDV Asia-4 lineage had emerged since 1924 and shared common ancestor with the America-2 lineage. Pressure analysis revealed that CDV nucleotides were under negative selection pressure for its rapid adaptation. These findings demonstrate the evolution of CDV Asia-4 lineage and identified the Asia-1 recombination event. The information regarding genetic diversity of CDVs is essential for further CDV’s research and monitoring."

Although prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has recently been associated with the ASD risk, whether BPA dysregulates ASD-related genes in the developing brain remains unclear. In this study, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi isolated from neonatal pups prenatally exposed to BPA was conducted and revealed a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ASD. Among the DEGs, several ASD candidate genes, including Auts2 and Foxp2, were dysregulated and showed sex differences in response to BPA exposure. The interactome and pathway analyses of DEGs using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed significant associations between the DEGs in males and neurological functions/disorders associated with ASD. Moreover, the reanalysis of transcriptome profiling data from previously published BPA studies consistently showed that BPA-responsive genes were significantly associated with ASD-related genes. The findings from this study indicate that prenatal BPA exposure alters the expression of ASD-linked genes in the hippocampus and suggest that maternal BPA exposure may increase ASD susceptibility by dysregulating genes associated with neurological functions known to be negatively impacted in ASD, which deserves further investigations."

The ‘missing Xe paradox’ is one of the phenomena at the Earth’s atmosphere. Studying the ‘missing Xe paradox’ will provide insights into a chemical reaction of Xe with C. We search the ground–state structure candidates of xenon carbides using the Universal Structure Predictor: Evolutionary Xtallography (USPEX) code, which has been successfully applied to a variety of systems. We predict that XeC 2 is the most stable among the convex hull. We find that the I4 ¯ 2m structure of XeC 2 is the semiconducting phase. Accurate electronic structures of tetragonal XeC 2 have been calculated using a hybrid density functionals HSE06, which gives larger more accurate band gap than a GGA–PBE exchange-correlation functional. Specifically, we find that the I4 ¯ 2m structure of XeC 2 is a dynamically stable structure at high pressure. We also predict that the P6/mmm structure of XeC 2 is the superconducting phase with a critical temperature of 38 K at 200 GPa. The ground-state structure of xenon carbides is of critical importance for understanding in the missing Xe. We discuss the inference of the stable structures of XeC 2 . The accumulation of electrons between Xe and C led to the stability by investigating electron localization function (ELF)."

Point-of-care testing (POCT) for uropathogen detection and chemical screening has great benefits for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The goal of this study was to develop a portable and inexpensive paper-based analytical device (PAD) for cultivating bacteria in situ and rapidly testing for nitrite on the same device. The PAD was fabricated using a wax printing technique to create a pattern on Whatman No. 1 filter paper, which was then combined with a cotton sheet to support bacterial growth. Nitrite detection was based on the principle of the Griess reaction, and a linear detection range of 0–1.6 mg/dL (R 2 = 0.989) was obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis demonstrated that the bacteria were able to grow and formed a cluster on the cellulose fibres within 2 hours. The enzyme β-glucuronidase, which is specifically produced by Escherichia coli, was able to convert the pre-immobilized 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronide sodium salt (X-GlcA), a colourless substrate, generating a blue colour. Under optimum conditions, the proposed device allowed bacterial concentrations in the range of 10 4 –10 7 colony forming units (CFU)/mL to be quantified within 6 hours. Moreover, the use of this device enables the identification of E. coli pathogens with selectivity in real urine samples. In conclusion, the PAD developed in this study for UTI screening provides a rapid, cost-effective diagnostic method for use in remote areas."

The anti-Topoisomerase 1 antibody is a common autoantibody in SSc with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, which is one of the clinical subtypes of SSc. On the other hand, an immunodominant peptide of topoisomerase 1 (Top1) self-protein (residues 349–368) was reported to have strong association with ATASSc. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was performed on the complexes of Top1 peptide with various HLA-DR subtypes divided into ATASSc-associated alleles (HLA-DRB1*08:02, HLA-DRB1*11:01 and HLA-DRB1*11:04), suspected allele (HLA-DRB5*01:02), and non-associated allele (HLA-DRB1*01:01). The unique interaction for each system was compared to the others in terms of dynamical behaviors, binding free energies and solvation effects. Our results showed that three HLA-DR/Top1 complexes of ATASSc association mostly exhibited high protein stability and increased binding efficiency without solvent interruption, in contrast to non-association. The suspected case (HLA-DRB5*01:02) binds Top1 as strongly as the ATASSc association case, which implied a highly possible risk for ATASSc development. This finding might support ATASSc development mechanism leading to a guideline for the treatment and avoidance of pathogens like Top1 self-peptide risk for ATASSc."

This entity is considered to be a variant of sialolipoma which harbours oncocytic nodules within a well-circumscribed lipomatous mass. We report a parotid mass in 73-year-old female that was difficult to diagnose in imaging and on biopsy. Ultrasonography and MRI demonstrated a mass with features thought to be consistent with lipoma. Twice needle core biopsies were performed. Both were indefinite for diagnosis. The first report favoured a lipoma and the second report suggested the lesion represented oncocytic hyperplasia or an oncocytoma. The microscopic examination of the excised surgical specimen demonstrated typical features of oncocytic sialolipoma, characterized by a predominately lipomatous component, sparse normal-appearing salivary gland tissue and multiple oncocytic nodules. This is the second case of oncocytic sialolipoma reported to occur in the parotid gland."

Population structure inferred by core genome (cg)MLST and Bayesian clustering analysis also strongly indicated distribution of two GBS populations in both Thailand and Vietnam. Deep phylogenetic analysis implied by CRISPR array's spacer diversity was able to cluster GBS isolates according to their temporal and geographic origins, though ST7 has varying CRISPR1-spacer profiles when compared to ST283 strains. Based on overall genotypic features, Thai ST283 strains were closely related to the Singaporean ST283 strain causing foodborne illness in humans in 2015, thus, signifying zoonotic potential of this GBS population in the country."

The SO3H-MCM-41 catalyst was synthesized by co-condensation in the presence of tetraethyl orthosilicate, 3-mercaptopropyl (methyl) dimethoxysilane (MPMDS) and cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide. In the last step, the solid catalyst (SH-MCM41) was oxidized by H2O2 to SO3H-MCM-41. The acid capacity of the obtained SO3H-MCM-41 catalyst was quantified by back titration with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. The physical and chemical properties of the SO3H-MCM-41 were characterized by nitrogen adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffractometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The effect of varying the catalyst loading (wt.%), reaction time (h) and temperature (°C) and molar composition of MPMDS on the biodiesel yield were investigated using a 2k factorial design. The optimal conditions to maximize the biodiesel yield, obtained from the response surface analysis using a Box–Behnken design, was a 14.5 wt.% catalyst loading, and a reaction time and temperature of 48 h and 129.6 °C. Under these conditions a fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) yield of 84% was predicted, and an 83.10 ± 0.39% yield experimentally obtained."

All rights reserved.In many provinces of Mekong delta, excessive groundwater extraction has resulted in many serious groundwater-related problems. To solve problems relevant to increasing water demand as well as other negative influence of groundwater depletion, an exigent question was raised whether at what time in future is the limits to local groundwater use reached? Hence, there is a need to know groundwater use (GWU) pattern and distribution in the study area for future groundwater management. In this study, firstly, the study used socio-economic data of Tra Vinh Province to classify groups of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, potential of water resources and population distributed in each district in order to design and conduct the socio-economic survey and to explore information relevant to GWU for each purpose. Secondly, the data set of 419 survey questionnaires per 9 surveyed communes were analysed by SPSS tool to estimate ratio of household using groundwater (RHHUG) for each purpose as well as average pumping rate (APR) per household for domestic use and per ha for agriculture use, respectively. Thirdly, the APRs were extended to propose the total GWU pattern and distribution during 2007-2016 by using socio-economic data of the province and expand to spatial distribution by using correlation with land surface temperature (LST) which was estimated from Landsat 8 images. Besides, the groundwater flow model of the study area was developed to verify the estimated amount of groundwater pumping (pattern and distribution) in the period. The study found that the GWU of Tra Vinh Province in dry season of 2016 was 346,279 m3/d in which two coastal districts occupied more than 50 percentages, i.e., about 188,551 m3/d. RHHUG increased from 1.5 to 2 times during the period of 2007 to 2016 in this area. LST distribution performed a good correlation (adj-R2 = 0.646) with GWU distribution in Tra Cu district. Results of groundwater modelling also showed that the discharge from aquifer (mainly pumping) was always higher than the recharge to aquifer."

All rights reserved.An over-strength factor in seismic design plays an important role in computing actual forces in a structural member designed to remain elastic. However, sources contributing to this over-strength have not yet been systematically quantified for tall buildings. This paper aims to investigate the contribution from different sources of the over-strength factor in a reinforced concrete (RC) tall building. The effect of how floor slabs are modeled in nonlinear structural models to compute lateral load capacity of the building is also investigated. 39-story RC building subjected to earthquake ground motions in Bangkok was first designed according to the current building codes. Then, pushover analysis was conducted to compute lateral load capacity of the building with three different specified strengths: design strength (with Φ factor), nominal strength (without Φ factor), and actual strength (with material over-strength). It was found that modeling floor slabs by elastic shell elements in nonlinear structural model should not be used in computing the ultimate lateral load capacity of the building because the contribution from slab-column framing action is unrealistically large at large roof displacement. When floor slabs are modelled by inelastic effective beam width approach, slab-column framing action contributes about 60% of the ultimate lateral load capacity of the building. The building has an overall lateral over-strength factor of 3.36 to 3.71. The over-strength factor arising from design process is 2.12 to 2.42 in which the contributions from strength reduction factor, material over-strength, and other sources involving the design requirements are about 1.10, 1.17, and 1.77, respectively. The over-strength factor arising from redundancy due to the redistribution of internal forces is about 1.55 and the contribution from steel strain hardening to the over-strength factor is relatively small."

The focus is on English and national languages, the two most important languages in those countries. A review of related past studies did not provide an answer to the question that we were interested in; i.e., which language is chosen for radio broadcasts in asean countries between the national language, which is the language most people understand and signifies national identity, and English, which is the lingua franca of the region and an international language? Data was taken from a sample of programs broadcast by radio stations in the ten asean countries. The results show that Singapore ranks the highest in using English in broadcasting (50% of all the programs), while Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam rank the lowest in using English (0%) but highest in using their national languages (100%). Code-switching between the countries’ national languages and English is found in five countries listed from highest to lowest as: the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and Thailand. Codeswitching is absent in Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. We conclude that despite the importance of English in the asean community, most asean countries prefer to use their national languages in radio broadcasting."

All rights reserved.Typical reinforced concrete short column is brittle in shear rather than flexure under lateral cyclic loading due to its shear deficiency. This paper presents the improvement of seismic behaviour of the reinforced concrete short columns which were strengthened by using ferrocement with expanded metal. Full scale experiments were conducted for two strengthened concrete columns with different volume fractions of expanded metal and the control specimen under lateral cyclic loading. It was found that the seismic behaviour in terms of the shear strength, stiffness, displacement ductility, and energy dissipation were significantly improved. The expanded metal mesh with the high specific surface provided the better performance for controlling the crack propagation. The brittle shear failure mode of the stirrup was reduced and the ductile flexure mode of the longitudinal reinforcement was dominant. The reduced shear force of the stirrup was compensated by the shear force of the expanded metal reinforcement which experienced relatively large strain. The technique of steel angle installation at the corners of column can successfully prevent the effect of sharpened corner wrapping of the mesh. A model to predict the shear strength of the strengthened column is presented in term of the global efficiency factor for expanded mental."

All rights reserved.The performance of precast concrete load-bearing walls exposed to fire is investigated using 3-D thermal and structural models. The thermal model is validated by comparing the predicted temperatures with results from the fire tests carried out in the present study, previous experimental studies, and Eurocode 2. The structural model is validated by comparing the predicted displacements and crack patterns with results from the fire tests carried out in the present study. It is found that the results obtained from the thermal model and the structural model are in line with the experimental data and Eurocode 2 results. The validated 3-D model of precast concrete load-bearing walls is used to study the effect of load level, slenderness ratio and boundary conditions on the fire performance of the walls. The results show that the fire resistance rating of load-bearing walls decreases with increasing load level and slenderness ratio, while the fire resistance rating of the walls increases when rotational restraints are imposed at the ends of the walls. Finally, equations are presented for estimating the fire resistance rating of the walls with different support conditions."

All rights reserved.This paper presents the 3D finite element (FE) analysis of the concrete-encased steel (CES) columns subjected to concentric or eccentric loadings. A new simplified technique of FE modelling that incorporates the concrete confinement behavior of the composite columns is proposed. This technique eliminates the need of predefining zones and constitutive properties of the confined concrete. After validated with past experimental data, the FE analysis is conducted to construct the strength interaction diagrams of the short CES columns. The effects of material properties including the compressive strength of concrete and yield strength of structural steel on the strength interaction diagrams of CES columns are numerically investigated. The FE results show that the concrete strength only has a significant effect on the column strength under combined compression and bending (compression phase) of the interaction diagram, while the yield strength of structural steel has a significant effect on both compression and tension phases. A comparison between the strength interaction diagrams predicted by FE analysis and the plastic stress distribution method specified in AISC360-16 “Specification for Structural Steel Buildings” shows that the design provision underestimates the strength of the short CES columns subjected to concentric or eccentric loadings. Such underestimation reduces as the compressive strength of concrete decreases or yield strength of structural steel increases."

All rights reserved.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to respiratory rate measurement using resonance tube to enhance the performance of microphone inserted and fixed at the end of the tube to catch breath sound signal from the mouth and/or nose. The signal is amplified and passed into envelope detector circuit after which it is compared with a suitable reference voltage in comparator circuit to generate a pulse train of square wave synchronized with the respiratory cycle. A simple algorithm is developed in a small microcontroller to detect rising edges of each consecutive square wave to calculate respiratory rate together with analysis of breathing status. In order to evade noises which will cause errors and artifacts in the measuring system, the reference voltage is creatively designed to intelligently adapt itself to be low during expiration period and high during inspiration and pause period using the concept of resolving contradiction in the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ). This makes the developed device simple and low-cost with no need for complicated filtering system. It can detect breath sound as far as 250 cm from the nose and can perform accurately as tested against End Tidal CO2 Capnography device. The result shows that the developed device can estimate precisely from as low as 0 BrPM to as high as 98 BrPM and it can detect shallow breathing as low as 10 mV of breath sound."
