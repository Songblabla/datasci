['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Time-periodic quantum states of weakly interacting bosons in a harmonic trap  2020 Elsevier B.V.We consider quantum bosons with contact interactions at the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) of a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic trap. At linear order in the coupling parameter g, we construct a large, explicit family of quantum states with energies of the form E0+gE1/4+O(g2), where E0 and E1 are integers. Any superposition of these states evolves periodically with a period of 8π/g until, at much longer time scales of order 1/g2, corrections to the energies of order g2 may become relevant. These quantum states provide a counterpart to the known time-periodic behaviors of the corresponding classical (mean field) theory."

Nevertheless, the poor conductivity and infinite relative volume changes limit its further practical applications. Herein, we developed a promising cathode design by ball milling of electrolytic manganese dioxide (MnO2) in the presence of graphite nanosheets. MnO2/graphite hybrids with the increase of contact surface and interfacial interaction are beneficial to construct an interfacial 3D conductive network and improve the inherent stability, which achieve the minimum volume change. As expected, the rate and cycling performance of MnO2/graphite hybrids (230 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 80 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, 80.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1) are better than that of MnO2 (113 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 24 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, 51.2% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1). The reduced volume change during charging/discharging can be observed via in situ optical observations. Furthermore, the Zn ion battery delivers higher energy density of 247 Wh kg−1 at 0.27 kW kg−1 and higher power density of 11.78 kW kg−1 at 78 Wh kg−1. Our work demonstrates the successful and large-scale conversion of industrial electrolytic manganese dioxide into a high-performance cathode of ZIBs."
"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Metals and Alloys', 'Materials Chemistry']","Fabrication of molybdenum doped carbon nitride nanosheets for efficiently photocatalytic water splitting  2020 Elsevier B.V.Rational design of photocatalyst with efficient performance in water splitting is highly desired for solar energy utilization. In this work, a simple and facile strategy was developed to synthesize Mo doped graphic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by a two-step thermal treatment process. As obtained product exhibits sheet-like morphology with porous structure, and the formation mechanism could be ascribed to the exfoliation effect in thermal environment. Photocatalytic property investigation reveals that Mo doped g-C3N4 nanosheets present greatly improved hydrogen evolution rate of 1.6 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light, which is about 9.4 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The improved performance could be well attributed to its enhanced visible light absorption, well suppressed carrier recombination and greatly increased specific surface area. Accordingly, our work provides a promising and straight forward way to develop advanced photocatalyst with high efficiency for renewable energy generation."
"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Metals and Alloys', 'Materials Chemistry']","Near-room-temperature superconductivity of Mg/Ca substituted metal hexahydride under pressure  2020 Elsevier B.V.A quest for room-temperature superconductors is undergoing rapid innovation due to the continuing proliferation of experimental and theoretical researches on high-pressure physics. Hydrogen-caged metal compounds have been proposed to promote high critical temperature superconductivity at pressures, providing a decent opportunity to investigate related phenomena at experimentally attainable pressures. This breakthrough is attributable to the uplifting key parameters, such as electron-phonon interaction and maximum phonon frequency, once thought to be limited, by utilising high pressures. A large class of metal polyhydrides has been theoretically proposed and experimentally realised to promote near-room-temperature superconductivity under high pressures. In this work, we theoretically reported the near-room-temperature superconductivity in a symmetrically Mg/Ca substituted hexahydride, i.e. Mg0.5Ca0.5H6. We showed that this ternary Mg0.5Ca0.5H6 compound adopts an Im3¯m structure, wherein a metal atom is embedded in a H24 cage, is thermodynamically and dynamically stable at pressures ranging from 200 to 400 GPa. The analyses of the electronic band structure, Fermi surface topologies, phonon dispersion, and spectral function manifest strong support for superconductivity. We obtained λ=2.53 and ωlog=1,400K for our Mg/Ca substituted hexahydride at 200 GPa, exhibiting a near-room-temperature Tc of 288 K, which completely exceeds the calculated Tc of its parent compounds, i.e. MgH6 and CaH6."
['Hepatology'],"Autophagy related protein 9A increase in hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and the role in apoptosis  2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All Rights Reserved.The majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases are associated with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Autophagy related protein 9A (ATG9A) is a transmembrane protein required for autophagosome formation. In order to investigate the role of ATG9A in HBV-associated HCC, ATG9A protein expression was determined in tumor liver tissues and compared with adjacent nontumor tissues from HCC patients with or without HBV infection. In HBVassociated HCC tissues, ATG9A protein level was increased in tumor liver tissues, but not in cases of non-HBV HCC. Our findings suggested that ATG9A might be involved in HBV and cancer cell survival. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the function of ATG9A in HBV replication using RNA interference to evaluate the HBV DNA level using real-time PCR. In the present study, there were no significant differences between shATG9A-transfected HepG2.2.15 cells and the mock control. However, we found that silencing ATG9A affected apoptosis in HepG2.2.15 and HepG2 cell lines. Our results indicated that ATG9A might be partly involved in the survival of HCC. Thus, the inhibition of ATG9A together with other targets might be a potential drug target for HCC treatment."
"['Materials Science (all)', 'Engineering (all)']",Deterioration of Open-cell Aluminum Foam in Strong Sulfuric Acid  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Open-cell aluminium foam was fabricated by pressure infiltration and salt leaching method. The processing conditions to obtain uniform interconnected pore structure aluminium foam were melting at 650°C for 1.5 h with the applied pressure of 1.5 bar. Aluminum foams were sectioned into thin pieces to investigate for deterioration behaviour in strong sulfuric acid for 30 days. Significant weight reduction of about 50% was observed when the specimen piece was submersed in 1.0 M H2SO4 in the first three days after which the weight reduction slightly increased to 60%. Al and Cu were the two main elements that had been leached out from the surface of aluminum foam in contact with the acid resulting in the formation of sulfates.
"['Materials Science (all)', 'Engineering (all)']","Kinetic study for the co-pyrolysis of water hyacinth biomass with waste polystyrene  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Co-pyrolysis behavior of water hyacinth (WHC) and waste PS using thermogravimetric analysis to determine kinetic parameters was investigated. TG and DTG results indicated that the pyrolysis of WHC and mixture of WHC and waste PS could be divided into three stages. It was found that co-pyrolysis of WHC and waste PS delayed the pyrolysis process with a wider decomposition temperature range, when compared with the pyrolysis of PS. The results compared with the pyrolysis of individual components revealed a positive synergistic interaction between WHC and waste PS according to the difference in weight loss. Coats-Redfern method was applied in the second stage to evaluate the activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A) from the data of weight loss using three major reaction mechanisms. Two conversion temperature zones, zone I of 240-400 °C and zone II of 400-530 °C, were identified and a best-fit model describing the co-pyrolysis behavior of mixture was achieved. The addition of waste PS to WHC led to a slight decrease in the activation energy in the first zone and then the activation energy significantly reduced in the second zone. Chemical reaction and diffusion-controlled reaction mechanisms could be kinetically examined and enabled good explanation of the co-pyrolysis behavior of the mixture of WHC and waste PS as well as individual pyrolysis."

All rights reserved.Carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to methanol is a promising way to mitigated CO2 emission. the Cu/ZnO catalyst applied with molecular sieves was tested on alcohol assisted methanol synthesis at 423 K and 5 MPa. The Cu/ZnO was synthesized by coprecipitation at optimal parameters (precipitation temperature = 333 K, pH = 8) in two different aging time (30min and 1h). The formation of Cu/ZnO was confirmed by XRD technique. The physiochemical properties of Cu/ZnO were analysed by SEM-EDX, N2-adsorption and desorption, and H2-TPR. the Cu/ZnO_1h with a longer aging time showed a larger specific surface area (100.58 m2/gcat) and well dispersion. The effect of molecular sieve was investigated. The molecular sieve only adsorbed the target compounds and did not involve as catalyst in the reaction. Methanol yield increased from 8.5% to 33.6% when Cu/ZnO was loaded with molecular sieve 3Å. The adsorption of water shifted the reaction equilibrium toward to more methanol yield. In contrast, when Cu/ZnO with molecular sieve 5Å was used, methanol yield decreased to 4%. It was likely that methanol product was adsorbed by molecular sieve 5Å and was separated from ethyl acetate which is a by-product."
"['Materials Science (all)', 'Engineering (all)']","Performance and cost analysis of hydrogen production from steam reforming and dehydrogenation of ethanol  2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Mitigation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has been a worldwide concern. Decreasing CO2 emission by converting it into higher value products such as methanol can be a promising way. However, hydrogen (H2) cost and availability are one of key barriers to CO2 conversion. Ethanol can be a sustainable source for H2 due to its renewable nature and easy conversion to H2-rich gas mixtures through ethanol steam reforming process. Nevertheless, steam reforming of ethanol generates CO2. Hence, this research is focused on different methods of H2 productions about a 1,665.47 t/y from ethanol for supplying to methanol plants was performed using Aspen PLUS V10. The ethanol steam reforming process required the lowest required ethanol feed for a certain amount of H2. In contrast, the ethanol steam reforming process presented significant amount of CO2 emission from reaction and electricity consumption. But the ethanol dehydrogenation of ethanol not only generates H2 without CO2 emission from the reaction but also ethyl acetate or acetaldehyde, which are value chemicals. However, ethanol dehydrogenation processes in case II and III presented relatively higher cost because by-products (ethyl acetate or acetaldehyde) were rather difficult to be separated."
['Hematology'],"Biomarker-guided preemption of steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease with a-1-antitrypsin  2020 by The American Society of HematologySteroid-refractory (SR) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but its occurrence is not accurately predicted by pre-HCT clinical risk factors. The Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) algorithm probability (MAP) identifies patients who are at high risk for developing SR GVHD as early as 7 days after HCT based on the extent of intestinal crypt damage as measured by the concentrations of 2 serum biomarkers, suppressor of tumorigenesis 2 and regenerating islet-derived 3a. We conducted a multicenter proof-of-concept “preemptive” treatment trial of a-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a serine protease inhibitor with demonstrated activity against GVHD, in patients at high risk for developing SR GVHD. Patients were eligible if they possessed a high-risk MAP on day 7 after HCT or, if initially low risk, became high risk on repeat testing at day 14. Thirty high-risk patients were treated with twice-weekly infusions of AAT for a total of 16 doses, and their outcomes were compared with 90 high-risk near-contemporaneous MAGIC control patients. AAT treatment was well tolerated with few toxicities, but it did not lower the incidence of SR GVHD compared with controls (20% vs 14%, P 5.56). We conclude that real-time biomarker-based risk assignment is feasible early after allogeneic HCT but that this dose and schedule of AAT did not change the incidence of SR acute GVHD. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03459040."
"['Organic Chemistry', 'Polymers and Plastics', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Materials Chemistry']","Origins of Electrostriction in Poly(vinylidene fluoride)-Based Ferroelectric Polymers  2020 American Chemical Society.Although electrostriction is ubiquitous for dielectric polymers, giant electrostriction has not been observed until relaxor ferroelectric (RFE) poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based polymers are achieved. However, the exact origin for giant electrostriction in these polymers has not been fully understood. By studying the electrostriction in the uniaxially stretched films of a ferroelectric poly(VDF-co-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] random copolymer and an RFE poly(VDF-co-TrFE-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)] random terpolymer in this work, we confirmed that ferroelectric switching with large hysteresis, such as in the case of P(VDF-TrFE), was not genuine electrostriction. By decreasing large ferroelectric domains to the nanometer scale (i.e., 2-3 nm), such as in the case of the P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) terpolymer, electrostriction with low hysteresis could be achieved. Two origins of the large electrostriction in these polymers were identified. The first was the mechano-electrostriction due to the poling field-induced conformation transformation of oriented polymer chains. The second was the electric repulsion of electrically aligned nanodomains. These effects could occur in both crystals and the oriented amorphous fraction, which links between the nanocrystals and the isotropic amorphous fraction. When the poling field was relatively low (e.g., <40 MV/m), the mechano-electrostriction was the major contribution and the electric repulsion effect was a minor contribution to electrostriction. Meanwhile, a strong temperature dependence of the low-field electrostriction coefficient was observed. Finally, we found an empirical inverse relationship between the electrostriction coefficient and the product of Young's modulus and dielectric constant. The knowledge obtained from this study provides an insightful understanding of the electrostriction mechanism in PVDF-based electroactive polymers, which will find potential applications in sensors and actuators for wearable electronics and soft robotics."

S. NIDHAN et al.  2020 American Physical Society.The coherent structures in the turbulent wake of a disk at a moderately high Reynolds number (Re) of 50000 are examined using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) which considers all three velocity components in a numerical database. The SPOD eigenvalues at a given streamwise (x) location are functions of azimuthal wave number (m), frequency (St), and SPOD index (n). By x/D=10, two specific modes dominate the fluctuation energy: (i) the vortex shedding (VS) mode with m=1,St=0.135,n=1, and (ii) the double helix (DH) mode with m=2,St→0,n=1. The VS mode is more energetic than the DH mode in the near wake but, in the far wake, it is the DH mode which is dominant. The DH mode, when scaled with local turbulent velocity and length scales, shows self-similarity in eigenvalues and eigenmodes while the VS mode, which is a global mode, does not exhibit strict self-similarity. Modes m=0, 3, and 4, although subdominant, also make a significant net contribution to the fluctuation energy, and their eigenspectra are evaluated. The reconstruction of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and Reynolds shear stress, (ux′ur′), is evaluated by varying (m,St,n) combinations. Higher SPOD modes contribute significantly to the TKE, especially near the centerline. In contrast, reconstruction of (ux′ur′) requires far fewer modes: |m|≤4, |St|≤1, and n≤3. Among azimuthal modes, m=1 and 2 are the leading contributors to both TKE and (ux′ur′). While m=1 captures the slope of the shear-stress profile near the centerline, m=2 is important to capture (ux′ur′) at and near its peak. SPOD is also performed in the vicinity of the disk to describe the modal transition to the principal contributors in the wake. The leading SPOD modes show a high-frequency shear-layer peak close to the disk and the vortex shedding mode commences its initial dominance of the wake at the end of the recirculation region."

This transformation using phenyliodine(iii) dicarboxylates as alkyl radical precursors and N-tosyl amidyl as the weakly coordinating directing group provides diverse (Z)-β-alkenyl alkylsulfones in moderate to good yields through direct C(sp2)-H alkylsulfonylation. This decarboxylative alkylsulfonylation from sulfur dioxide under copper catalysis proceeds efficiently, and the weak nitrogen coordination provides excellent regio- A nd stereoselectivities. Moreover, the synthetic practicability of this transformation is demonstrated through a gram-scale synthesis.

The extraction and defibrillation of nanometer-scale cellulose fibers from such waste using strong chemical solutions have been extensively investigated. However, the using of strong chemical solutions can cause adverse effects to the fibers as well as negatively affect the environment. Some evidence has shown that mechanical treatments, such as steam explosion and high-pressure homogenization, are environmentally friendly when compared with chemical treatment techniques. This work aimed to isolate the cellulose nanofibers from sugarcane bagasse waste using steam explosion pretreatment at various temperatures (195, 200, 205, and 210 °C) and durations (5, 10, and 15 min) before passing through a microfluidizer within 12 passes of 200 mL cellulose suspension. The mean separation analysis using Duncan's Multiple Range test showed that higher temperatures significantly improved the efficiency of non-cellulosic substances reduction, as evidenced by an increment of whiteness index (81.39–90.02), thermal degradation temperature (313.92–326.34 °C) and crystallinity index (74.27–81.42%). The obtained cellulose nanofibers exhibited very fine diameter within the range of 3–7 nm, had a high cellulose content (92.74 ± 0.14%) and a low density (0.8989 g/cm3). The obtained cellulose nanofibers could be applied in various fields such as medical, cosmetic, food packaging, and electronic device applications."
"['Pharmacology', 'Biological Psychiatry']","Mitochondria and immunity in chronic fatigue syndrome  2020It is widely accepted that the pathophysiology and treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) could be considerably improved. The heterogeneity of ME/CFS and the confusion over its classification have undoubtedly contributed to this, although this would seem a consequence of the complexity of the array of ME/CFS presentations and high levels of diverse comorbidities. This article reviews the biological underpinnings of ME/CFS presentations, including the interacting roles of the gut microbiome/permeability, endogenous opioidergic system, immune cell mitochondria, autonomic nervous system, microRNA-155, viral infection/re-awakening and leptin as well as melatonin and the circadian rhythm. This details not only relevant pathophysiological processes and treatment options, but also highlights future research directions. Due to the complexity of interacting systems in ME/CFS pathophysiology, clarification as to its biological underpinnings is likely to considerably contribute to the understanding and treatment of other complex and poorly managed conditions, including fibromyalgia, depression, migraine, and dementia. The gut and immune cell mitochondria are proposed to be two important hubs that interact with the circadian rhythm in driving ME/CFS pathophysiology."

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.This study identified the effects of pursed-lip breathing (PLB), forward trunk lean posture (FTLP), and combined PLB and FTLP on total and compartmental lung volumes, and ventilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sixteen patients with mild to moderate COPD performed 2 breathing patterns of quiet breathing (QB) and PLB during FTLP and upright posture (UP). The total and compartmental lung volumes and ventilation of these 4 tasks (QB-UP, PLB-UP, QB-FTLP, PLB-FTLP) were evaluated using optoelectronic plethysmography. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to identify the effect of PLB, FTLP, and combined strategies on total and compartmental lung volumes and ventilation. End-expiratory lung volume of ribcage compartment was significantly lower in PLB-UP than QB-UP and those with FTLP (P < .05). End-inspiratory lung volume (EILV) and end-inspiratory lung volume of ribcage compartment were significantly greater during PLB-FTLP and PLB-UP than those of QB (P < .05). PLB significantly and positively changed end-expiratory lung volume of abdominal compartment (EELVAB) end-expiratory lung volume, EILVAB, tidal volume of pulmonary ribcage, tidal volume of abdomen, and ventilation than QB (P < .05). UP significantly increased tidal volume of pulmonary ribcage, tidal volume of abdomen, and ventilation and decreased EELVAB, end-expiratory lung volume, and EILVAB than FTLP (P < .05). In conclusion, combined PLB with UP or FTLP demonstrates a positive change in total and compartmental lung volumes in patients with mild to moderate COPD."

Collectively known as the satellitome, this genomic component offers exciting evolutionary insights into aspects of primate genome biology that raise new questions and challenge existing paradigms. A complete human reference genome was recently reported with telomere-to-telomere human X chromosome assembly that resolved hundreds of dark regions, encompassing a 3.1 Mb centromeric satellite array that had not been identified previously. With the recent exponential increase in the availability of primate genomes, and the development of modern genomic and bioinformatics tools, extensive growth in our knowledge concerning the structure, function, and evolution of satellite elements is expected. The current state of knowledge on this topic is summarized, highlighting various types of primate-specific satellite repeats to compare their proportions across diverse lineages. Inter- and intraspecific variation of satellite repeats in the primate genome are reviewed. The functional significance of these sequences is discussed by describing how the transcriptional activity of satellite repeats can affect gene expression during different cellular processes. Sex-linked satellites are outlined, together with their respective genomic organization. Mechanisms are proposed whereby satellite repeats might have emerged as novel sequences during different evolutionary phases. Finally, the main challenges that hinder the detection of satellite DNA are outlined and an overview of the latest methodologies to address technological limitations is presented."

Typical LPS contains GlcN disaccharide as the core of lipid A. However, some bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospira interrogans contain GlcN3N in lipid A instead. This modification has been shown to dampen the host immune response and increase resistance to antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, investigation of the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of GlcN3N has promising applications in the development of vaccines, antibiotics, or usage of the enzymes in chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified LPS. Here, we describe biochemical and structural investigation of GnnA from A. ferrooxidans (AfGnnA) that is responsible for oxidation of UDP-GlcNAc, which subsequently undergoes transamination to produce UDP-GlcNAc3N as a precursor for LPS biosynthesis. AfGnnA is specific for NAD+ and UDP-GlcNAc. The crystal structures of AfGnnA in combination with molecular dynamics simulation and mutational analysis suggest the substrate recognition mode and the catalytic mechanism. K91 or H164 is a potential catalytic base in the oxidation reaction. The results will not only provide insights into the biosynthesis of unusual LPS but will also lay the foundation for development of more immunogenic vaccines, novel antibiotics, or utilization of GnnA in the synthesis of UDP-sugars or modified LPS."

Using semantic computation models, we can construct a model in a semantic space. In this paper, we present a mechanism to execute models presented by the semantic spaces. We have presented a mechanism to implement combinational and sequential logic computations based on the semantic space model. The combinational and sequential logic computations are the basic functions in computer systems. However, we still need a control mechanism like that in computers.

The most important contribution of this paper is that we first present a concept for control and program based on the semantic space model. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism, we performed a demonstration experiment. In the experiment, an agent is constructed for unmanned ground vehicle control with the control mechanism. A video camera is used to determine the position of the vehicle and obstacles on the road.

All rights reserved.Fluorescein sodium (FluNa) is an organic xanthene-derivative fluorochrome appearing as crimson powder. In the form of solution, fluorescein absorbs blue light and emits green-to-yellow fluorescence under the incidence of visible or ultra-violet light. In petroleum industry, it is normally used as fluorescent tracer to determine reservoir connectivity between injection and production wells. In this study, fluorescein concentration at 10 ppm was critical concentration that reversed relationship between fluorescence intensity and fluorescence concentration. Emission wavelength at maximum fluorescence intensity became a function of fluorescein concentration until 512 nm at 1 ppm and there was no longer reduction of emission wavelength beyond this value at lower concentration. Fluorescence of fluorescein could not be observed by naked eyes at concentrations below 100 ppb, whereas its detection limit by fluorescence spectrophotometer could be lowered to 1 ppb. Fluorescence spectra of fluorescein concentrations at 10 ppt and 100 ppt were similar to those of tap water, formation water, and deionized water. Therefore, detection limit of fluorescein was determined to be at 1 ppb. Fluorescence of fluorescein was photodegraded by light up to 30% when stored inside transparent glass bottles and being exposed to light for 7 days and fluorescence of the solution became darker with time. On the other hand, fluorescence intensities of FluNa solution stored inside amber-coloured glass bottles in both all-time concealment and normal room conditions were almost identical. Fluorescence spectra of the solution at pH of 3 had lower fluorescence intensity and shorter emission wavelength at maximum fluorescence intensity than the solutions at pH of 7 and 11 that were mostly identical. Fluorescence of fluorescein was not affected by temperature in the range of 30-70°C for 12 days. Hence, the storage conditions for fluorescein solution were recommended to be stored inside amber-coloured glass bottle to prevent photodegradation with pH 7 or above."

PHIV had higher incidence of any HR-HPV infection than HU adolescents {33.05 [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.82 to 52.46] vs. 15.73 [95% CI: 8.18 to 30.22] per 100 person-years, P = 0.04}. The persistence of any HR-HPV genotypes (detected at ≥2 annual visits) was not different by group (PHIV 27% vs. HU 23%, P = 0.75). Having ≥3 sex partners in past 6 months (adjusted prevalence ratio 2.39, 95% CI: 1.14 to 5.05; P = 0.02) and co-infection with other sexually transmitted infections (syphilis, chlamydia, and/or gonorrhea) were associated with persistent HR-HPV infection (adjusted prevalence ratio 6.21, 95% CI: 2.87 to 13.41; P < 0.001).Conclusions: Thai PHIV male adolescents had a higher incidence of HR-HPV infection than those without HIV. Having multiple sex partners and co-infection with sexually transmitted infections was associated with persistent HR-HPV infection. These data demonstrate the need to prioritize PHIV male adolescents in routine and catch-up HPV vaccination programs."

Among the different types of oil palm residues, i.e., trunk, frond, and empty fruit bunch, the trunk residue offers the highest synthesis gas (syngas) (H2 and CO) yields via the gasification process; therefore, it was selected as the biomass model compound. The effect of gasification operating conditions on the syngas composition, yield, bio-methanol production, energy consumption, and exergy performance was examined. The yield of syngas increased with increasing gasifying temperature, whereas that of bio-methanol exhibited the opposite trend due to the decrease in H2 concentration of the syngas. The gasifier was an important unit for enhancing the exergy efficiency of the system, which was decreased when the equivalent ratio (ER) and gasifying temperature increased. Recirculating pressure swing adsorption offgas to the gasifier did not benefit bio-methanol production, nor did it improve energy and exergy performance. The maximum yield of bio-methanol was achieved by a once-through process that maintained the gasifying temperature at 750 °C and ER at 0.25. Under these conditions, the maximum energy and exergy efficiencies were 38.57 and 25.44%, respectively."

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses data from companies in Thailand for the 1998–2016 period. To measure the cost of debt, this study uses the realized interest cost, measured as the total interest expense for the one year ahead divided by the average value of total debt outstanding during that year. Findings: The results show a positive association between the cost of debt and two measures of public-client specialization and busyness, which are the number of public clients audited by an individual audit partner in each year and the proportion of the number of public clients divided by the number of total clients in an individual audit partner’s portfolio. Originality/value: In the literature, there is a lack of research on whether a higher number of public clients in an audit partner’s portfolio leads to better or worse perceived audit quality. This study extends prior literature by examining whether creditors’ perception of audit quality depends on the audit partner specialization or busyness and specifically, on the number of public clients of the auditor. The findings indicate that public-client busyness of a particular audit partner, rather than the audit partner public-client specialization, matters in the cost of debt."

The drug-matrix hydrogels based on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were prepared by solution casting method using citric acid as the crosslinking agent at various amounts. The 5-fluorouracil, an anticancer non-ionic drug, was released from the CMC hydrogels under applied electrical field. The diffusion coefficient and the release mechanism of the drug of the CMC hydrogels were investigated by the modified Franz-diffusion cell with the PBS buffer solution at the pH value of 7.4 and at 37 °C for the duration of 24 h. The effects of mesh size, electric potential, and electrode polarity were systematically investigated. The swelling test illustrated an increase in the mesh size with decreasing crosslinking agent. In addition, the drug diffusion coefficient increased with decreasing crosslinker: repeated group mole ratio. The diffusion coefficient depended critically on the applied electric potential and the electrode polarity. The non-ionic drug release mechanisms were identified as the matrix deswelling and electroosmosis, in addition to the pure diffusion without electric field. Thus, CMC has been shown a potential bio-based matrix for electrically controlled non-ionic drug delivery."

However, there is a paucity of research examining children’s engagement in making in low-income formal school settings. Likewise, little work has been done to explore the transformative perspectives of both the children and the people around them. This study aims to explore a Culturally Relevant Constructionist Design framework that emphasizes making as a way of building connections to ones’ community. The participants’ shifting perspectives and receptivity in engaging in maker activities that involve making inventions for their community, inspired by the nation’s most beloved figure, King Bhumibol are evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates fourth-grade students, a teacher and community members around a public school in Thailand. Using qualitative research methods, data collection includes interviews, field notes observation, photos and videos of the sessions. This paper presents three case studies that represent the shifting perspectives and receptivity of teachers, community members and students through engaging in making experience. The first case illustrates the ways in which building for others supports the students’ formation of an identity of a creator. The two cases describe a teacher and a community member who developed new-found perceptions of students as valuable contributors to the community. Findings: The findings highlight making inventions for the community as ways to connect teachers, community members and students together. The study also identifies key perceptions and experiences that empower students’ as contributors to their community. Through the process of making, the teacher and the community members also developed new-found positive perspectives of the students. Particularly, they viewed the students beyond traditional school performance metrics, and considered their other latent abilities. Practical implications: This study discusses these findings in light of previous research on maker education especially in low-income communities. It also showcases the role of making for the betterment of the community as a tool for engendering change in schools and empowering students to design and make personally and socially meaningful projects. The study also highlights how design-based research carried out in the international context, particularly in Thai locality and classrooms. Originality/value: This study argues against the deficit lens that assumes a low sense of expectation for what students from lower-income schools can do. Students hold unique worldviews that lead them to create innovations relevant to their local and cultural needs. The study addresses this gap by designing a framework that emphasizes making relevant cultural connections to students’ communities. The study also showcases maker-centered experiences that enable students to express their ideas, to cultivate relationships, to help others and to see themselves in new ways. The perspectives of the participants hold implications beyond the predominant focus of maker education initiatives."

The effect of modifier type on the CO2 adsorption capacity of the NR/silica foam composites was investigated under ambient temperature and pressure. The CO2 adsorption capacity of the NR/silica foam composite material increased from 1.81 to 6.71 mg/g after filling with silica particles modified by 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane. The NR/silica foam composite material filled with silica particles modified with a short chain structure (3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane) showed a higher CO2 adsorption capacity than those with a longer modifying chain structure (N-[(3-trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine or N-[(3-trimethoxysilyl)propyl]diethylenetriamine). The increasing of adsorption temperature caused the chains of the long-chain modifier on the silica particle surface to become more flexible, resulting in a high selectivity for capturing CO2. The NR/silica foam composite filled with unmodified or modified silica particles showed a high reusability compared to NR foam."

With the proliferation of food safety incidents in recent years, social media has often been a major channel for public engagement in risk communication because of its social networking and immediate interaction. To understand the users’ needs and satisfaction, this study proposed a model to develop and evaluate the antecedents of continuance intention toward food safety information from social media. Based on the questionnaire collected from 289 Facebook users, this study assessed the integrated model of the expectation-confirmation theory and technology acceptance model with technology readiness as moderator. The results showed that the perceived ease-of-use, usefulness, and confirmation indirectly affected social media continuance usage intention through satisfaction; perceived ease-of-use, usefulness, and satisfaction were the direct determinants that affected the users’ social media continuance intention. Furthermore, positive technology readiness had significant effects on the relationship between the perceived ease-of-use, usefulness, confirmation, satisfaction, and continuance intention toward food safety information.

However, their 3D printability remains a challenge with most reported materials suffering from high brittleness and low toughness. Here, we have described especially modified epoxy resins that enable 3D printing with both fast and slow curing rates. These materials exhibit greatly enhanced toughness, tunable thermomechanical properties, and excellent shape memory behavior. Two different printing systems, including a two-part static mixing printhead and a single extrusion printhead, were developed for fast- and slow-curing epoxies, respectively. The rheology of inks in both systems has been modified into printable thixotropic fluids with the aid of silica nanoparticles and other additives. Epoxide-functionalized telechelic polybutadiene was added into the resins, which are then introduced inside the epoxy network after cross-linking. The addition of polybutadiene rubber significantly improves the toughness (over 135%), fracture strain (over 200%), and shape memory behavior. By adding different amounts of the rubber telechelic, thermomechanical properties, including modulus, elongation, and Tg of epoxy, can be well controlled in a wide range to satisfy different applications."

However, less attention has been paid to whether or not this way of thinking and methodological processes can be fully applied to specific settings like medical startups. Some challenges such as implementation, resource allocation, working procedures, and organizational transformation could be different in shapes and forms and in intensity vis-à-vis medical startups. The study aims to cope with this deficiency by, firstly, reviewing previous empirical studies that presented process models, challenges, and positive effects of the agile manifesto and the agile-stage-gate model on well-established firms. Secondly, to investigate the agile application in startup settings, the researchers conducted a longitudinal case study by drawing on a successful medical product startup in Thailand that has engaged in the actual implementation of the agile manifesto and agile-stage-gate model in its product development. Thirdly, the study compared the results of implementing the agile in large firms and the medical startup case in this study to investigate similarities and differences in terms of challenges and effects. The study showed both correlations in the same and contrasting directions of the previous studies and the case study's results. The findings of this study can be created and categorized into four aspects of applying the agile-stage-gate in a startup, including balance transformation, work process, person-job fit, and team collaboration.

The W boson decays are selected by requiring one identified electron or muon and an imbalance in transverse momentum. The two jets are required to have a high dijet mass and a large separation in pseudorapidity. The measurement is based on data collected with the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The observed (expected) significance for this process is 4.9 (4.6) standard deviations. After combining with previously reported CMS results at 8 TeV, the observed (expected) significance is 5.3 (4.8) standard deviations. The cross section for the electroweak Wγjj production in a restricted fiducial region is measured as 20.4±4.5fb and the total cross section for Wγ production in association with 2 jets in the same fiducial region is 108±16fb. All results are in good agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Constraints are placed on anomalous quartic gauge couplings in terms of dimension-8 effective field theory operators."

All rights reserved..We have performed a search over 3440 deg2 of Epoch 1 (2017-2019) of the Very Large Array Sky Survey to identify unobscured quasars in the optical (0.2 < z < 3.2) and obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared that have brightened dramatically in the radio over the past one to two decades. These sources would have been previously classified as ""radio-quiet""quasars based on upper limits from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey (1993-2011), but they are now consistent with ""radio-loud""quasars (). A quasi-simultaneous, multiband (∼1-18 GHz) follow-up study of 14 sources with the VLA has revealed compact sources (<0.″1 or <1 kpc) with peaked radio spectral shapes. The high-amplitude variability over decadal timescales at 1.5 GHz (100% to >2500%) but roughly steady fluxes over a few months at 3 GHz are inconsistent with extrinsic variability due to propagation effects, thus favoring an intrinsic origin. We conclude that our sources are powerful quasars hosting compact/young jets. This challenges the generally accepted idea that ""radio-loudness""is a property of the quasar/AGN population that remains fixed on human timescales. Our study suggests that frequent episodes of short-lived AGN jets that do not necessarily grow to large scales may be common at high redshift. We speculate that intermittent but powerful jets on subgalactic scales could interact with the interstellar medium, possibly driving feedback capable of influencing galaxy evolution."

Typical types of synthetic FRP(s) are aramid, glass, carbon, PEN (polyethylene naphthalates) and PET (polyethylene terephthalate), whereas natural FRP(s) include flax, sisal, hemp and jute. In this article, the performance of a novel, low-cost and sustainable strengthening technique i.e., fiber rope reinforced polymer (FRRP) composites to enhance the axial compressive strength, strain and deformability of concrete specimens through external wrapping is explored. The outstanding benefits of the newly proposed FRRP composites are low-cost, wide availability, easy application and more environmentally friendly. In this research, 39 circular plain concrete (PC) cylinders were tested to failure under uniaxial compression. The research parameters covered fiber rope type (such as hemp, cotton and polyester) and number of FRRP layers. Experimental results proved that external confinement by using FRRP is very effective to enhance ultimate strength, strain and deformability of the concrete. Further, based on the test results, the implementation of the existing ultimate compressive strength and strain models established for the synthetic and natural FRP(s) is evaluated to assess their application to the newly proposed FRRP confinement. It is found that more or less all considered models do not accurately predict the tested ultimate compressive strength and strain of the FRRP-confined concrete. In the end, new ultimate strength and strain models are proposed to accurately predict the ultimate compressive strength and strain of concrete specimens confined with fiber rope reinforced polymer composites. The predicted ultimate compressive strength and strain values compare favorably with the experimental results of the present study."

The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a 13 TeV center-of-mass energy recorded at the CERN LHC, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 137 fb-1. As the predominant decay modes of the Higgs and Z bosons are to a pair of quarks, the analysis focuses on final states consisting of jets resulting from the six quarks produced in the events. Since the two jets produced in the decay of a highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs or Z boson can merge to form a single jet, nine independent analyses are performed, categorized by the number of observed jets and the reconstructed event mode. No signal in excess of the expected background is observed. Lower limits are set on the VLQ mass at 95% confidence level equal to 1570 GeV in the case where the VLQ decays exclusively to a b quark and a Higgs boson, 1390 GeV for when it decays exclusively to a b quark and a Z boson, and 1450 GeV for when it decays equally in these two modes.

It is structurally dominated by NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW trending normal faults as a result of multistage rifting since the Late Oligocene. Half-graben and full-graben basin geometries can be observed from 2D regional seismic sections. In this study, structural restoration techniques were applied to validate the structural interpretation of the original hardcopy of the 2D seismic sections. Stratigraphic information is compiled from published papers and well reports. Our results revealed that most of the deformation was concentrated during the Late Oligocene. Main depocenters for the syn-rift sediments focused in the basin center along the west-dipping normal faults. These faults cut the prerift section and their orientations were possibly controlled by the Permo-Triassic fabrics that underlie the Phetchabun Basin. By measuring the length of the profiles before and after faulting, the restorations show that the extensions of the Wichianburi Subbasin decrease from 12.30% during the main rift phase (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene) to 2.53% during the second phase of rifting. Rifting only focused in the basin center with the development of NNW-SSE to N-S trending intrarift faults. Since the Middle Miocene, the Wichianburi Subbasin has developed under the tectonic phase of post-rift subsidence with interruption by intrusive activities."

The bacterial consortia were enriched by incubating rubber wastewater sludge in a medium containing 2-MBT for 28 days. Stepwise acclimatization was conducted with increasing 2-MBT concentrations from 50 to 200 mg L−1 in nitrogen-containing medium for 76 days. The process significantly increased the bacterial number and changed the dominant populations. Among these consortia, the EN consortium from benzothiazole-containing sludge had the highest specific 2-MBT biodegradation rate of 5.2 ± 0.5 mg L−1 day−1 mg protein-1 and could degrade up to 300 mg L−1 2-MBT. From 16S rRNA gene analysis, Pseudomonas was the dominant genus at approximately 70 % of the total population. Stenotrophomonas was the second most abundant populations and have never been reported for 2-MBT biodegradation. The EN consortium removed 65–79 % and 90–93 % of 112 mg L−1 2-MBT and ∼4000 mg L−1 COD in rubber wastewater, respectively, which were significantly higher than the values of natural attenuation. Therefore, the EN consortium could be an ideal inoculum for the post-treatment of benzothiazoles in rubber industrial wastewater."

Transient perturbations in free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) concentrations are indispensable for the translation of signals into adaptive biological responses. The transient increase in [Ca2+]cyt levels is sensed by an array of Ca2+ sensor relay proteins such as calmodulin (CaM), eventually leading to conformational changes and activation of CaM. CaM, in a Ca2+-dependent manner, regulates several transcription factors (TFs) that are implicated in various molecular, physiological, and biochemical functions in cells. CAMTA (calmodulin-binding transcription activator) is one such member of the Ca2+-loaded CaM-dependent family of TFs. The present review focuses on Ca2+ as a second messenger, its interaction with CaM, and Ca2+/CaM-mediated CAMTA transcriptional regulation in plants. The review recapitulates the molecular and physiological functions of CAMTA in model plants and various crops, confirming its probable involvement in stress signaling pathways and overall plant development. Studying Ca2+/CaM-mediated CAMTA TF will help in answering key questions concerning signaling cascades and molecular regulation under stress conditions and plant growth, thus improving our knowledge for crop improvement."

Pain features including intensity, number of locations, impact, and duration were evaluated. Psychometric measures assessed pain-related catastrophizing and disability, illness perception, distress, anxiety, depression, injustice experience, dysmorphic concerns, and insomnia. Results: Most patients were between 30 and 59 years old (58.3%), female (69.8%), working (66.0%), and experienced pain for more than 6 months (68.5%). Pain intensities were higher in women than men and higher in disabled than working patients. Scores indicating elevated stress and depression were also observed in disabled patients. The sample prevalence rates of clinically relevant axis II instrument scores were as follows: Graded Chronic Pain Scale for the Head (GCPS-H), 27%; Patient Health Questionnaire 4 (PHQ4), 21%; PHQ9, 21%; Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), 20%; General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7), 15%; Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), 15%; Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ), 14%; GCPS for the Body (GCPS-B), 13%; PHQ for Stress (PHQstr), 6%; and Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ), 2%. Noteworthy results of correlation analysis of the clinically relevant axis II scores and pain measures were as follows: the PHQstr had moderate associations (0.34–0.43) with the sum of pain intensity at rest and during function, number of pain locations, and typical pain intensity. The IEQ scores were moderately associated with typical pain intensity at 0.39. The DCQ scores were moderately associated with pain extension at 0.41. Conclusions: Moderate correlations of certain pain and well-being measures were found in patients reporting clinically relevant stress, injustice experience, and dysmorphic concern, all of which reflect impaired well-being. PHQ4 is suitable for routine distress screening in the clinical setting."
['Veterinary (all)'],"The Expression of Proteins Related to Serotonin Pathway in Pulmonary Arteries of Dogs Affected With Pulmonary Hypertension Secondary to Degenerative Mitral Valve Disease  Copyright  2020 Sakarin, Surachetpong and Rungsipipat.Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can cause medial thickening, a hallmark of pulmonary arterial remodeling. The serotonin (5HT) pathway has been suggested as a factor associated with PH by inducing pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) proliferation, a major cause of medial thickening. This study aims to demonstrate the expression of molecules in the 5HT pathway in the pulmonary artery of dogs affected with PH secondary to degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) compared to DMVD and healthy control dogs. Materials and Methods: The study included lung samples from the carcasses of 19 older small-breed dogs (Control n = 5, DMVD n = 7, DMVD+PH n = 7). Lung tissue sections were performed Hematoxylin and Eosin staining for measuring the percentage of medial thickness and immunohistochemistry for evaluating the expression of proteins in the 5HT pathway including serotonin transporter (SERT), serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2A), tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2). Results: Medial thickening of the pulmonary arteries was found in the DMVD and DMVD+PH groups compared to the control. The medial thickening of the DMVD+PH group was increased significantly compared to that in the DMVD group. Intracytoplasmic expression of proteins related to the 5HT pathway was mainly presented in the medial layer of the pulmonary arteries. The control group showed a low expression of proteins related to the 5HT pathway. An intensive expression of SERT, 5HT2A, TPH1, and ERK1/2 protein was seen in the DMVD and DMVD+PH groups. Interestingly, pERK1/2 was strongly represented only in the DMVD+PH group. Conclusions: Overexpression of proteins related to the 5HT pathway including SERT, 5HT2A, TPH1, ERK1/2, and pERK1/2 was associated with medial remodeling in dogs affected with secondary to DMVD."

To enter human cells, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-RBD) initially binds to the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2-PD). Using peptides to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 is a potential therapeutic solution for COVID-19. A previous study identified a 23-mer peptide (SBP1) that bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD with comparable KD to ACE2. We employed computational protein design and molecular dynamics (MD) to design SARS-CoV-2-RBD 25-mer peptide binders (SPB25) with better predicted binding affinity than SBP1. Using residues 21-45 of the α1 helix of ACE2-PD as the template, our strategy is employing Rosetta to enhance SPB25 binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-RBD and avoid disrupting existing favorable interactions by using residues that have not been reported to form favorable interactions with SARS-CoV-2-RBD as designed positions. Designed peptides with better predicted binding affinities, by Rosetta, than SPB25 were subjected to MD validation. The MD results show that five designed peptides (SPB25F8N, SPB25F8R, SPB25L25R, SPB25F8N/L25R, and SPB25F8R/L25R) have better predicted binding affinities, by the MM-GBSA method, than SPB25 and SBP1. This study developed an approach to design SARS-CoV-2-RBD peptide binders, and these peptides may be promising candidates as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors."

We here report post-marketing safety data on the use of the vaccines in individuals in the community obtained through active pharmacovigilance surveillance including pregnant women participating in a prospective observational study. Between May 2017 and February 2020 for TdaPgen and between June 2018 and February 2020 for aPgen, participating health care providers vaccinated and collected safety data for 11,429 exposed adolescents and adults. This included 1778 pregnant women. The incidence rate of adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) was 11.5 per 1000 of vaccinated individuals (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 9.7–13.6). AEFIs mostly concerned local pain at the injection site and muscle pain, and symptoms were mild and mostly resolved within a few days with no complications. The incidence rate of AEFIs in women vaccinated during pregnancy was 1.1 per 1000 (95% CI 0.3–4.1). Of 833 pregnant women vaccinated with recombinant aPgen or TdaPgen, 91.4% (95% CI 89.3–93.3) had uncomplicated pregnancies and 98.7% (95% CI 97.7–99.4) of the 855 babies delivered by these women were born healthy, which exceeds rates generally reported in Thailand. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported during the surveillance period. In conclusion, active pharmacovigilance confirms that the recombinant pertussis vaccines aPgen (Pertagen) and TdaPgen (Boostagen) are safe in adolescents and adults, including pregnant women vaccinated in the second or third trimester of pregnancy."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Two widely investigated methane hydrate promoters, tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) and cyclopentane (CP), for methane hydrate formation and dissociation were comparatively investigated in the quiescent reactor at 2.5 °C and 8 MPa. The results indicated that the increase in the mass fraction TBAB decreased the induction time. However, it did not significantly affect the methane uptake. In the presence of CP, the increase in the CP concentration resulted in an increase in the induction time due to the increasing thicknesses of the CP layer in the unstirred reactor. Moreover, the methane uptake was varied proportionally with the CP concentration. The addition of TBAB resulted in a higher methane uptake than that of CP, since the presence of TBAB provided the cavities in the hydrate structure to accommodate the methane gas during the hydrate formation better than that of CP. On the contrary, the presence of CP significantly increased the induction time. Although the methane recovery remained relatively the same regardless of TBAB and CP concentrations, the recovery was higher in the presence of TBAB."

In Bangladesh, the practice of EBF among adolescent mothers remains unexplored. The aim of our study was to understand the EBF practices among adolescent mothers and their determinants in both the Health and Demographic Surveillance (HDSS) system areas of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) service area (ISA) and government service area (GSA) in rural Matlab, Bangladesh. For the purpose of our study, we collected relevant information from the database of the Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) of icddr,b and performed analysis to understand the trends and identify the determinants of EBF and identify the determinants of EBF among adolescent mothers living in two areas between 2007 and 2015. In total, 2947 children born to adolescent mothers were included in our final analysis. We used the Kaplan–Meier and the Cox-proportional hazards models to determine the differences in EBF practices in the two areas. We noted a lower trends of EBF in the ISA compared to the GSA in bivariate analysis. However, after adjusting for confounding variables, EBF status was 15% lower in the GSA than the ISA (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72–0.99). The father’s education was significantly different among the two populations. In both study areas, the coverage of EBF among adolescent mothers was lower than the national average (42% vs. 65%).

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections and are often caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). We investigated the distribution of phylogenetic groups, adhesin genes, antimicrobial resistance, and biofilm formation in E. coli isolated from patients with UTIs. Methods. In the present study, 208 UPEC isolated from Thai patients were classified into phylogenetic groups and adhesin genes were detected using multiplex PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using agar disk diffusion. The Congo red agar method was used to determine the ability of the UPEC to form biofilm. Results. The most prevalent UPEC strains in this study belonged to phylogenetic group B2 (58.7%), followed by group C (12.5%), group E (12.0%), and the other groups (16.8%). Among adhesin genes, the prevalence of fimH (91.8%) was highest, followed by pap (79.3%), sfa (12.0%), and afa (7.7%). The rates of resistance to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanate were 65%, 54.3%, and 36.5%, respectively. The presence of adhesin genes and antibiotic resistance were more frequent in groups B2 and C compared to the other groups. Of the 129 multidrug-resistant UPEC strains, 54% were biofilm producers. Our findings further indicated that biofilm production was significantly correlated with the pap adhesin gene (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion. These findings provide molecular epidemiologic data, antibiotic resistance profiles, and the potential for biofilm formation among UPEC strains that can inform further development of the appropriate prevention and control strategies for UTIs in this region."

Twelve children with SDCP were tested with three conditions of STS task: low chair with horizontal seat (control), low chair with anterior seat inclination (AiC), and high chair with horizontal seat (HiC) conditions. A 3D motion analysis system and two force plates were used to collect and analyze the movement time, mechanical work, kinematics, and kinetics. The results showed that in the AiC and HiC conditions, movement time and mechanical work during STS were significantly reduced when compared with the control condition. In addition, in the AiC condition, trunk alignment at the beginning of the STS task improved and the range of pelvis movement reduced, whereas in the HiC condition, the range of movement of hip, knee, and ankle joint and maximum hip and knee extension moment were reduced in children with SDCP when compared with the control condition. These results suggest that chair height and anterior seat inclination may have a positive effect on STS ability in children with SDCP. Trial register No. TCTR20170619003."

Yet, secondary bacterial infection is uncommon. However, as epithelium is injured and barrier function is lost, bacterial products entering the circulation might contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Methods: We studied 19 adults, severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 13th March and 17th April 2020. Blood samples on days 1, 3, and 7 of enrollment were analyzed for endotoxin activity assay (EAA), (1 → 3)-β-d-glucan (BG), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the circulating bacteriome. Results: Of the 19 patients, 13 were in intensive care and 10 patients received mechanical ventilation. We found 8 patients with high EAA (≥ 0.6) and about half of the patients had high serum BG levels which tended to be higher in later in the illness. Although only 1 patient had a positive blood culture, 18 of 19 patients were positive for 16S rRNA gene amplification. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The diversity of bacterial genera was decreased overtime. Conclusions: Bacterial DNA and toxins were discovered in virtually all severely ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients. This raises a previously unrecognized concern for significant contribution of bacterial products in the pathogenesis of this disease."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The increased use of a new rice cultivar is the result of increasing consumer demands for healthier choices. In this study, physicochemical, thermal, pasting, and functional properties of flour from RD43 rice, a new rice variety, and its food application were investigated. RD43 rice flour demonstrated an irregular and polyhedral shape with a volume mean diameter of 103 ± 0.15 µm. In addition, the amylose content of RD43 rice and Hom Mali rice flour was 19.04% and 16.38%, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transforms Infrared (FTIR) confirmed the presence of a V-type crystalline structure and less crystallinity in RD43 rice flour, which resulted in a significant reduction of the water absorption index (WAI), swelling power (SP), water solubility index (WSI), gelatinization temperature, and pasting properties. Comparing with Hom Mali rice flour, RD43 rice flour had greater ability to disrupt cholesterol micellization and bind bile acid. Furthermore, it had lower starch digestibility, with a lower percentage of rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and higher percentage of undigestible starch than Hom Mali rice flour. Moreover, steamed muffins based on RD43 rice flour had lower starch digestibility than Hom Mali steamed muffins. The sensory analysis showed no significant differences between Hom Mali and RD43 steamed muffins. The findings suggest that RD43 rice flour could be an alternative ingredient for lowering the glycemic index of food products."

One way to deal with this imbalance problem is to modify the standard classification algorithm to capture minority instances and majority instances simultaneously. This work modifies the recursive partitioning algorithm based on a set of tubes, called the tube-tree algorithm. A tube-tree is a collection of tubes building from the combination of the input attributes where an internal node contains distinct class tubes corresponding to their respective classes. A tube composes of three components: a core vector, a tube length, and a tube radius built for each class regardless of its size suitable for an imbalance dataset. The forty six experiments are derived from the KEEL repository to compare the performance of the tube-tree with the support vector machine, the decision tree from C4.5, the decision tree from C5.0, and the naive Bayes classifier. The results of the tube-tree show the improvement over other classifiers of recall, and F1-measure except precision via the Wilcoxon signed rank test."

This study quantifies elemental composition of rainwater and aerosol collected simultaneously during 2019 monsoon season from Kolkata, a megacity in Eastern India marred by air pollution to understand sources and estimate wet deposition flux. Elemental composition (Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Mn, V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) of rainwater was measured in ICP MS along with pH, conductivity, chloride (Cl−), nitrate (NO3−) and sulphate (SO42−) ions. Trace metal composition of PM10 collected in between rain events were also analysed to understand anthropogenic sources and atmospheric leaching of metals. Crustal enrichment factors (EFs) identified anthropogenic sources for Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in PM10. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three anthropogenic sources, industrial emission, traffic emission and waste incineration in addition to the natural background from the crustal dust for the aerosol metals. Majority of rainwater samples had almost neutral pH (average 6.81 ± 0.74, 1SD), with a range of 5.4 to 8.0. In rainwater, Na and Cl− had marine origin and majority of SO42− had non-marine sources. Cu, Zn, Cd, V, Cr and Pb concentrations of rainwater follow the trend in PM10 most likely because part of the metals are derived from aerosol leaching. The EFs indicated that all the metals except Fe had anthropogenic origin in rainwater. The wet deposition fluxes were in the order of Ca > Na > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Mn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > V > Cd. Overall, the results show significant influence of anthropogenic sources on rainwater chemistry in addition to natural soil dust and marine aerosols. In spite of anthropogenic influence, the trace metal and anion concentrations in rainwater are well within the limits prescribed by World Health Organization (WHO), European Union (EU), USA and Indian Drinking Water Standards."

Of all the isolates, ABR604 and ABR601 were resistant to 12 and 10 out of the 15 antimicrobials tested, respectively. This study indicates the presence of MDR A. baumannii in pets other than dogs and cats and highlights the possible role of these animals as reserviors for the spread of MDR A. baumannii to humans, animals and environment."

All rights reserved.The piglet pre-weaning mortality is a major problem in swine production. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of dietary gel protein supplementation on pre-weaning mortality and growth in piglets. A total of 48 Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred sows were included in this study. On farrowing day, the sows were randomly allocated into two experimental groups by parity: Control (n=20) and Treatment (n=28). The piglets in the Control group sows (n=234) were not orally supplemented and the piglets in the Treatment group sows (n=316) were orally supplemented with gel protein (Porcistart®, Virbac. Co., Ltd., Loudeac, France). The piglets in the treatment group had ad libitum access to gel protein in a container placed in the creep area for the piglets. The feeding protocols were carried out from farrowing day until Day 7 after farrowing. The creep feed was provided from day 7 until weaning. On Day 7 after farrowing, 2 mL blood samples were obtained from 160 piglets (Control, n = 54 and Treatment, n = 106) randomly selected from sows included in the experiment for IGF-1 analysis. The piglet body weight was recorded at Days 3, 10 and weaning. The litter weight gains were calculated. The piglet pre-weaning mortality was determined at Days 3, 10 of life and at weaning. The lactation length, litter size at Days 3 and 10 and weaning were 25.5 ± 0.9 days, 11.5 ± 1.8 piglets/litter, 10.0 ±1.5 piglets/litter and 9.6 ± 2.1 piglets/litter, respectively. No effect of gel protein supplementation on piglet weaned weight and piglet pre-weaning mortality was found in the present study (P > 0.05). On average, the serum IGF-1 concentration was 128.1 ± 54.7 ng/ml (range 22.6-243.5 ng/ml) and piglet weaned weight was 6.7 ± 1.3 kilograms (range 4.4-8.9 kilograms). Serum IGF-1 concentration in the treatment group (140.3 ng/ml) was higher than in the control group sows (120.2 ng/ml, P = 0.027). In conclusion, dietary gel protein supplementation in the piglets increased piglet serum IGF-1 but had no effect on weight and pre-weaning mortality in piglets."

All rights reserved.Campylobacter is considered to be a major foodborne pathogen associated with human bacterial gastroenteritis in many parts of the world. Southeast Asia (SEA) has been challenging for infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance in recent years. Antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter isolates has been reported in humans and animals in this region. Since the SEA region is one of the top tourist destinations of the world, the provision of safe food is of importance for the travel-related foodborne infections. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the status of antibiotic resistance of Campylobacter spp. in the SEA region to reduce the impact of infection and to implement mitigation strategies. This review provides further insights into the true burden of the trend of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter spp. in the SEA region. Based on the published data, antimicrobial resistance of both human and animal in Campylobacter isolates is becoming increasingly common in SEA, especially to fluoroquinolones and tetracycline. Therefore, appropriate interventions are required to minimize Campylobacter contamination and to harmonize the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in SEA."

Published by Oxford University Press and Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.Background: Fluoroscopy is often used during the endoscopic drainage of pancreatic-fluid collections (PFCs). An electrocautery-enhanced coaxial lumen-apposing, self-expanding metal stent (ELAMS) facilitates a single-step procedure and may avoid the need for fluoroscopy. This study compares the treatment outcomes using ELAMS with and without fluoroscopy. Methods: Patients with PFCs who had cystogastrostomy from January 2014 to February 2017 were enrolled. Two groups were studied based on fluoroscopy use. Technical success was defined as uneventful insertion of ELAMS at time of procedure. Clinical success was defined as (i) clinical resolution of symptoms after the procedure and (ii) >75% reduction in cyst size on computed tomography 8 weeks after stent placement. Adverse events including bleeding, stent migration, and infection were recorded. Results: A total of 21 patients (13 males) had PFCs drainage with ELAMS in the study period. The mean age was 51.6 ± 14.2 years. Thirteen patients had walled-off necrosis while eight had a pancreatic pseudocyst. The mean size of the PFCs was 11.3 ± 3.3 cm. Fluoroscopy was used in seven cases (33%) and was associated with a longer procedure time compared to non-fluoroscopy (43.1 ± 10.4 vs 33.3 ± 10.5 min, P = 0.025). This association was independent of the size, location, or type of PFCs. Fluoroscopy had no effect on the technical success rates. In fluoroless procedures, the clinical resolution was 91% as compared to 71% in fluoroscopy procedures (P = 0.52) and the radiologic resolution was 57% as compared to 71% in fluoroscopy procedures (P = 0. 65). Three cases of stent migration/displacement occurred in the fluoroless procedures. Conclusions: ELAMS may avoid the need for fluoroscopy during cystogastrostomy. Procedures without fluoroscopy were significantly shorter and fluoroscopy use had no impact on the technical or clinical success rates."

Architecture designs often grow in depth and usually outperform their predecessors. However, these deep networks are not optimized for a specific application, especially with limited datasets such as X-ray dataset. Moreover, training these networks require considerable GPU resources. YOLOv3 is an object detection network iterated to include the recent developments in the deep learning research field. Thus, it also has a deep backbone network similar to Residual Network. The developments incorporated are effective in general datasets and benchmarks but needlessly big for a specialized application. Hence, this paper proposes methods to create a suitable backbone for YOLOv3 with Neuroevolution. Neuroevolution is an optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm, which does not require gradients to optimize. Using Neuroevolution, a small network for limited dataset can be designed without human expertise. Experimental results show that it can compete with the larger networks in terms of accuracy."

A zinc-air battery (ZAB) is a promising ESS due to its high capacity, low cost and high potential to support circular economy principles. However, despite ZABs' technological advancements, a generic dynamic model for a ZAB, which is a key component for effective battery management and monitoring, is still lacking. ZABs show nonlinear behaviour where the steady-state gain is strongly dependent on operating conditions. The present study aims to develop a dynamic model, being capable of predicting the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of a refuellable ZAB, using a linear parameter-varying (LPV) technique. The LPV model is constructed from a family of linear time-invariant models, where the discharge current level is used as a scheduling parameter. The developed LPV model is benchmarked against linear and nonlinear model counterparts. Herein, the LPV model performs remarkably well in capturing the nonlinear behaviour of a ZAB. It significantly outperforms the linear model. Overall, the LPV approach provides a systematic way to construct a robust dynamic model which well represents the nonlinear behaviour of a ZAB."

In this study, cell suspension cultures of M. alba that produced mulberroside A and other phytochemicals were treated with 20 min UV-C irradiation to investigate the effect of time after UV-C treatment on levels of mulberroside A, oxyresveratrol, resveratrol, and rutin. The amount of mulberroside A produced from cell suspension cultures of M. alba that were treated with UV-C was significantly higher than the control. However, there were no significant differences in the levels of oxyresveratrol, resveratrol, and rutin. The effect of UV-C in combination with precursor feeding on phytochemical production of cell suspension cultures of M. alba was investigated. L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine were used as precursors. The addition of 0.05 mM L-phenylalanine 5 d prior to UV-C irradiation doubled the content of mulberroside A in cell suspension cultures of M. alba as compared to the non-irradiated and untreated cells. The use of precursor feeding in combination with UV-C irradiation could be an alternative method for the production of mulberroside A in M. alba."

The individual hydrogels prepared by crosslinking with divinyl sulphone (DVS), were kept together and left to dry. The evaporation preceded the pendant DVS groups on the surface of the two hydrogels to react and bind. The finally obtained fused xerogel can be stored for a long time and used on demand as an uniaxially swelling bigel.

This paper incorporates an experimental investigation into the seismic response of nonductile bridge piers strengthened with low-cost glass fiber reinforced polymers (LC-GFRP). Three full-scale bridge piers were tested under lateral cyclic loading. A control bridge pier was tested in the as-built condition and the other two bridge piers were experimentally tested after strengthening them with LC-GFRP jacketing. The LC-GFRP strengthening was performed using two different configurations. The control bridge pier showed poor seismic response with the progress of significant cracks at very low drift levels.

All rights reserved.Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has been studied as a multi-functional agent for bone tissue engineering. An osteo-inductive effect of wild-type TMV has been reported, as it can significantly enhance the bone differentiation potential of bone marrow stromal cells both on a two-dimensional substrate and in a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel system. A TMV mutant (TMV-RGD1) was created which featured the adhesion peptide arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD), the most common peptide motif responsible for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, on the surface of the virus particle to enhance the bio-functionality of the scaffold material. We hypothesised that the incorporation of either wild-type TMV or TMV-RGD1 in the 3D hydrogel scaffold would induce bone healing in critical size defects of the cranial segmental bone. We have previously tested the virus-functionalised scaffolds, in vitro, with a hyaluronic acid-based system as an in-situ hydrogel platform for 3D cell encapsulation, culture, and differentiation. The results of these experiments suggested the potential of the virus-functionalised hydrogel to promote in vitro stem cell differentiation. The hydrogel-forming system we employed was shown to be safe and biocompatible in vivo. Here, we further explored the physiological responses regarding bone regeneration of a calvarial defect in both normal and osteoporotic ovariectomized rat models. Our results, based on histological analysis in both animal models, suggested that both wild-type TMV and TMV-RGD1 functionalised hydrogels could accelerate bone regeneration, without systemic toxicity, evaluated by blood counts. New bone formation was intensified by the incorporation of the RGD-mutant viral particles. This finding increased the potential for use of the rod-shaped plant virus as a platform for the addition of powerful biofunctionality for tissue engineering applications.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.This study aimed to examine the predictive validity of two internationally well-known instruments, the Modified Home Falls and Accidents Screening Tool (Modified HOME FAST) and the Modified Home Falls and Accidents Screening Tool-Self Report (Modified HOME FAST-SR), and the newly developed Thai Home Falls Hazard Assessment Tool (Thai-HFHAT) (69 items) in predicting falls among older Thai adults. It also aimed to examine the predictive validity of the two abbreviated versions (44 and 27 items) of the Thai-HFHAT, which were developed post hoc to accommodate older adults’ limited literacy and poor vision and to facilitate the identification of high-impact home fall hazards that are prevalent in the Thailand context. A prospective cohort study was conducted among 450 participants aged 60 years and above who were assessed by the aforementioned tools at baseline, for which data on fall incidence were then collected during the one-year follow-up. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs); then, Harrell’s C-statistics and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to identify the best cutoff point, sensitivity and specificity for each instrument. The results showed that the fall hazard rate was 2.04 times per 1,000 person-days. Taking into account both the predictive validity and applicability, the Thai-HFHAT (44 items) was found to be the most suitable screening tool due to its highest sensitivity and specificity (93% and 72%) at the cutoff score of 18. In conclusion, our study showed that these internationally validated home fall hazard assessment tools were quite applicable for Thailand, but further tailoring the tools into a specific local context yielded even more highly valid tools in predicting fall risk among older Thai adults. Although these findings were well reproducible by inferring from the internal validation results, further external validation in the independent population is necessary."

This study was aimed at investigating the frequency, phenotype, and function of circulating MAIT cells, as well as their alterations after successful direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in HCV-infected patients with or without HIV infection. Methods A total 85 patients (51 HCV-monoinfection and 34 HCV/HIV-coinfection), who received elbasvir/grazoprevir from a clinical trial and 20 healthy controls were included. MAIT cells in blood were characterized using flow cytometry at baseline and 24 weeks post-treatment. Results HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfected patients achieved similar sustained virological response rates (SVR24, 94.1% vs. 97.1%). Circulating MAIT cells in the monoinfection and coinfection groups were presented at low frequencies in comparison with healthy controls (median, 1.1% vs. 1.1% vs. 2.4%, P<0.001) and exhibited features of chronic activation and impaired functional capacity. A negative correlation between circulating MAIT cell frequency and liver stiffness assessed by magnetic resonance elastography was observed. Compared with baseline, increased in circulating MAIT cells after successful DAA therapy was mainly detected in HCV-monoinfected patients compared with HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals. Moreover, MAIT cell restoration was predominantly observed among patients with significant fibrosis to cirrhosis (F2-F4). Conclusions These data indicated that dysregulation of MAIT cells might play a role in the progression of chronic HCV infection. Partial restoration of MAIT cell frequency and function was observed after successful DAA therapy, particularly in HCV-monoinfected patients."

The SPPA is a model that the potential investors supply and sell the PV output power to customers with the discount rates, directly. If the excess energy supplied to the grid is allowable, the investors will get additional revenue from the reverse power. The proposed rates from the investors are practically formulated in term of the SPPA discount rates on utility's retail rate. Therefore, to convince the customers while retaining revenue of the investors, attractive and feasible SPPA discount rates should be investigated thoroughly. The proposed methodology in this paper to determine the SPPA discount rates for rooftop PVs under the SPPA and BTMS is presented. The cost optimization was developed and proposed to minimize the SPPA electricity charges while maintaining an acceptable internal rate of return (IRR). The benefit of the customers is the lower electricity charges, while the benefit of the investors is the sold power from rooftop PVs. Furthermore, with the proposed methodology, the large general service load in Thailand to assess the effect of the rate of excess energy and size of rooftop PVs. From the result, it showed that an oversized rooftop PVs will restrict the SPPA discount rates. The customers will get the higher SPPA discount rate if the rate of excess energy increases."

The salient features of these bricks are low price, low weight and required less use of cement mortar during construction. In the past many studies have been published on axial compression of CCI brick walls. This study aims to investigate the lateral cyclic response of CCI brick masonry walls under earthquake loading. To achieve this, a comprehensive experimental program was established in which a total number of six large-scale CCI brick masonry walls were constructed and tested under lateral cyclic loading. Different types of walls such as solid walls and walls with window openings were constructed and tested. In addition, different construction methods such as dry stacking, use of cement sand grout and steel bars were exercised to evaluate their efficiency on strength and ductility of the CCI hollow brick masonry walls. The experimental results indicate that dry stacking method is very vulnerable against lateral loading. Use of cement sand grout and steel bars is found very effective to enhance strength of CCI brick masonry walls. The damage pattern of the CCI hollow brick masonry walls with openings is observed very destructive as compared with solid walls (walls without openings)."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.CD161 expression on CD4+ T cells is associated with a Th17 functional phenotype, as well as with an innate capacity to respond to interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18 without T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Chronic HIV-1 infection is associated with loss of the CD161+ CD4 T cell population, and non-human primate studies suggest that their depletion is associated with disease progression. However, the dynamics of the CD161+ CD4+ T cell population during acute HIV-1 infection remains unknown. In this study, we characterize peripheral blood CD161+ CD4+ T cells in detail, and examine how they are affected during the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. Unbiased surface proteome screening and principal component analysis indicated that CD161+ CD4+ T cells are relatively phenotypically homogeneous between donors, and are intermediates between conventional CD4 T cells and innate-like T cells. In acute untreated HIV-1 infection, the circulating CD161+ CD4+ T cell population decreased in frequency, as did absolute cell counts starting from peak viral load, with elevated levels of activation and exhaustion markers expressed throughout acute HIV-1 infection. The capacity of these cells to respond to stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18 was also reduced. Early initiation of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) during acute HIV-1 infection restored the functionality of peripheral blood CD161+ CD4+ T cells, but not their frequency. In contrast, early ART initiation prevented the decline of colonic CD161+ CD4+ T cells that otherwise started during acute infection. Furthermore, loss of peripheral and colonic CD161+ CD4+ T cells in untreated infection was associated with levels of viral load. These results suggest that acute HIV-1 infection has profound effects on the CD161+ CD4+ T cell population that could not be completely prevented by the initiation of ART."

The effects of experimental parameters including concentrations of Fenton’s reagents, pH, and light intensity on the decolorization efficiency and initial rate constant of RR239 were evaluated. As the concentration of Fenton’s reagents increased, the decolorization efficiency increased because of quick oxidation and Fe2+-consumption. At pH 3, complete decolorization of RR239 was attained in 10 min using Fe2+ and H2 O2 concentrations of 0.075 and 5 mM, respectively. Decolorization efficiency improved when using photo-assistance to regenerate Fe2+ catalyst. At 2 min, both Fenton oxidation and photo-Fenton oxidation using 9 W of UV light decolorized RR239 by 65%, but the initial rate constant was higher using 9 W photoassistance. Moreover, 18 W of UV yielded the highest RR239 decolorization of 72% at 2 min with an initial rate of 28.01 mM–1 min–1. A further increase in UV light intensity from 18 to 27 W depressed the initial rate constant. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals were 60% and 30%, respectively, under 18 W-assisted oxidation on Fe2+ catalyst.

This prompts the need for a comprehensive review of the global literature that summarizes the global economic burden and a description of methodology details and their variation. This study aimed to systematically identify studies on cost of illness and economic evaluation associated with snakebites, summarize study findings, and evaluate their methods to provide recommendations for future studies. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Econlit for articles published from inception to 31 July 2019. Original articles reporting costs or full economic evaluation related with snakebites were included. The methods and reporting quality were assessed. Costs were presented in US dollars (US$) in 2018. Results Twenty-three cost of illness studies and three economic evaluation studies related to snakebites were included. Majority of studies (18/23, 78.26%) were conducted in Low- and Middle-income countries. Most cost of illness studies (82.61%) were done using hospital-based data of snakebite patients. While, four studies (17.39%) estimated costs of snakebites in communities. Five studies (21.74%) used societal perspective estimating both direct and indirect costs. Only one study (4.35%) undertook incidence-based approach to estimate lifetime costs. Only three studies (13.04%) estimated annual national economic burdens of snakebite which varied drastically from US$126 319 in Burkina Faso to US$13 802 550 in Sri Lanka. Quality of the cost of illness studies were varied and substantially under-reported. All three economic evaluation studies were cost-effectiveness analysis using decision tree model. Two of them assessed cost-effectiveness of having full access to antivenom and reported cost-effective findings. Conclusions: Economic burdens of snakebite were underestimated and not extensively studied. To accurately capture the economic burdens of snakebites at both the global and local level, hospital data should be collected along with community survey and economic burdens of snakebites should be estimated both in short-term and long-term period to incorporate the lifetime costs and productivity loss due to premature death, disability, and consequences of snakebites"

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated different stages of ischemic stroke in different vascular territories, suggesting cardiogenic embolism. Past history was significant for advanced-stage adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix under chemoradiation treatment. On echocardiogram, vegetation at the aortic valve was observed. With the absence of evidence of infectious endocarditis, diagnosis of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis was made, and the patient was treated by long-term anticoagulant. This case is unique in terms of the adenocarcinoma cell type of cervical cancer, which is uncommon and has been rarely reported to be related to nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis."
['Energy (all)'],"Alternative liquid fuel from pyrolysis of polyethylene wax  2020 The AuthorsPolyethylene wax was investigated its possibility to be liquid fuel using non-catalytic pyrolysis process at pyrolysis temperature of 400, 450 and 500 °C. The results showed that at 450 °C pyrolysis temperature, the highest liquid product yield was 78.24 and the left part was the incondensable gas and a solid fuel. The results from the elemental analysis showed the products obtained from pyrolysis had similar components for all conditions. The carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen contents were in the range of 76.49–86.38%, 12.99–14.77%, 4.67–6.38%, and 0.46–2.09%, respectively. The results of the chemical structure analysis by GC–MS showed that the increasing pyrolysis temperature resulted in the mainly increasing of the straight-chain paraffin but instead reducing the structure of the double bonds. The results from the fuel property analysis indicated that the specific gravity, viscosity, and heating value of pyrolysis oil were as 0.83, 2.17 cSt, and 10,939 cal/g respectively, that is consistent with the conventional diesel standards. However, the flashpoint still needs to be improved continuously."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Quantity takeoff based on building information modeling (BIM) is more reliable, accurate, and rapid than the traditional quantity takeoff approach. However, the quality of BIM models affects the quality of BIM-based quantity takeoff. Our research focuses on drywalls, which consist of wall framings and wall panels. If BIM models from the design phases do not contain wall framing models, contractors or sub-contractors cannot perform quantity takeoff for purchasing materials. Developing wall framing models under a tight schedule in the construction phase is time-consuming, cost-intensive, and error-prone. The increased geometries in a BIM model also slow down the software performance. Therefore, in this research, an automatic method is proposed for calculating quantities of wall framings from drywalls in a BIM model. Building elements that overlap with the drywalls are subtracted from the drywall surfaces before calculation. The quantities of wall framings are then embedded into the properties of drywall in the BIM model and hence they can be extracted directly from the BIM model. A prototype system is developed and the proposed method is validated in an actual construction project. The results of the case study showed that the prototype system took 282 s to deliver accurate quantities of wall framings with deviations of 0.11 to 0.30% when compared to a baseline, and the file size of the BIM model after applying the proposed method was increased very slightly from 47.0 MB to 47.1 MB. This research contributes to developing an approach for quantity takeoff of wall framings that are not present in a BIM model. Accurate quantities of wall framings can be obtained while the time and cost of developing wall framings for quantity takeoff can be saved. The proposed method does not increase the geometries in the BIM model; therefore, the file size of the model does not increase greatly, which stabilizes the software performance."

All rights reserved.This paper proposes the calculation of the simple levelized cost of electricity of PV and battery energy storage system for supporting the investment decision of the EV hybrid charging station. The paper introduces the problems of EV charging against the grid power system. Thus, the hybrid charging for EV is suggested. The study provides an architecture of the hybrid EV charging station along with the factor impacting the EV infrastructure for acknowledgment. The cost elements of the station are presented to address the benefits of the investment. Besides, the profit is mainly from the margin of the electricity price, therefore, this study compares the electricity cost of PV and PV equipped with a battery with the commercial on-peak electricity tariff. The results show that the charging cost contributed by PV alone has the lowest amount throughout the study period year 2020 – 2030. In contrast, the hybrid charging cost contributed by PV and battery has a higher value than the on-peak tariff during 2020 – 2025 but it is lower afterward. The result supports the feasibility of charging an EV by solar power and the hybrid power system in the future."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Happiness around the world: A combined etic-emic approach across 63 countries  2020 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.What does it mean to be happy? The vast majority of cross-cultural studies on happiness have employed a Western-origin, or ""WEIRD"" measure of happiness that conceptualizes it as a self-centered (or ""independent""), high-arousal emotion. However, research from Eastern cultures, particularly Japan, conceptualizes happiness as including an interpersonal aspect emphasizing harmony and connectedness to others. Following a combined emicetic approach (Cheung, van de Vijver & Leong, 2011), we assessed the cross-cultural applicability of a measure of independent happiness developed in the US (Subjective Happiness Scale; Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999) and a measure of interdependent happiness developed in Japan (Interdependent Happiness Scale; Hitokoto & Uchida, 2015), with data from 63 countries representing 7 sociocultural regions. Results indicate that the schema of independent happiness was more coherent in more WEIRD countries. In contrast, the coherence of interdependent happiness was unrelated to a country's ""WEIRD-ness."" Reliabilities of both happiness measures were lowest in African and Middle Eastern countries, suggesting these two conceptualizations of happiness may not be globally comprehensive. Overall, while the two measures had many similar correlates and properties, the self-focused concept of independent happiness is ""WEIRD-er"" than interdependent happiness, suggesting cross-cultural researchers should attend to both conceptualizations."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Leptospira infection can cause potential hazards to human health by stimulating inflammation, which is mediated mainly through the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) pathway. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are promising for medical applications, as they display both bioinert and noncytotoxic characteristics. AuNPs have been shown to have the ability to modify immune responses. To understand the in vitro immunomodulatory effect of AuNPs in a Leptospira infection model, the activation of TLR2 expression was examined in HEK-Blue-hTLR2 cells treated with Leptospira serovars and/or AuNPs (10 and 20 nm). The ability of AuNPs to modulate an inflammatory response induced by Leptospira was examined in terms of transcript expression level modulation of three proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) using two-stage quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The results revealed that the administration of 10 nm AuNPs could augment the Leptospira-induced TLR2 signaling response and upregulate the expression of all three cytokine gene transcripts, whereas the 20 nm AuNPs attenuated the TLR2 activation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. This indicates that AuNPs can modulate inflammatory parameters in Leptospira infection and different-sized AuNPs had different immunomodulatory functions in this model."

All rights reserved.This paper examines the progressivity impacts of tax subsidies in the Thai personal income tax system on household saving and investment using tax return data from Thailand. It measures the tax progressivity using the Suits index and computes bootstrapped confidence intervals. It finds that overall, the subsidies make the tax system significantly more progressive-the regressive effects of the deduction mechanism are outweighed by voluntary participation and the design regarding capped contribution levels. However, there is a strong heterogeneity in the progressivity impacts, with some tax subsidies being highly regressive. It also illustrates that turning tax deductions into non-refundable credits could have important effects on progressivity. Our findings raise concerns about the equity implications of such tax subsidies and suggest that policymakers should pay serious attention to the design of tax subsidies as well as the propensity of households to save or invest in different classes of assets."

In patients with rebleeding, the rescue treatment with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is recommended. However, in a real world setting where the accessibility to TIPS is limited, repeated endoscopic therapy is inevitably performed. Objective: To study the outcomes of EVL on rebleeding and mortality in the resource-limited setting. Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent EVL during 2017 to 2018 are included. Patients were treated with vasoactive drugs and EVL until the eradication of varices. We focus on the outcome of a second attempt at EVL to control EVB. The rebleeding and mortality rate within 6 months after the combined treatment were collected. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors of rebleeding. Results: There were 339 EVL performed during the 2-year period. Of these procedures, EVL was indicated to control acute EVB in 118 patients. EVB in 98 patients (83%) were successfully controlled in only one session of EVL, while those of 20 patients (17%) required at least 2 sessions to control the recurrent EVB. In the rebleeding group, no patient rebled within 5 days after the first EVL, while 15 patients (75%) rebled within 6 weeks. Once rebled, the second EVL was performed. There were 5 patients (25%) whom the second EVL failed to control the recurrent EVB. Those recurrent EVB were finally controlled by the other endoscopic therapy. The 6-week mortality after rebleeding was 15%. Hepatocellular carcinoma and creatinine are factors associated with recurrent EVB within 6 weeks with odds ratio (OR) 5.96 (95% CI 1.41 to 25.19, p = 0.02) and OR 1.47 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.11, p = 0.04), respectively. Conclusion: The second attempt at endoscopic therapy can be considered to control recurrent EVB after the first EVL with a success rate of 75% in area where an accessibility to a treatment with TIPS is limited."

Materials and Methods: Between January 2013 and June 2019, 171 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent minimally invasive radical prostatectomy. These were LRP in 62 patients and RALP in 109 patients. All clinical data were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographic data, perioperative parameters, pathological reports, oncological outcomes, and functional outcomes including continence and potency rate at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were compared between groups. Results: Patients in the RALP group were significantly younger (p=0.03) and had a shorter follow-up period (p=0.004). The estimated blood loss was significantly lower in the RALP group (p=0.001). There were no significant differences in intraoperative and 30-day postoperative complications. Pathological results and overall positive surgical margin rate (PSM) were not significantly different. In pT3 patients, PSM was significantly lower in the RALP group (p=0.045). Oncological outcomes were not different in term of biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate (p=0.3), median time to BCR (p=0.45), BCR-free survival (p=0.81), and overall survival (p=0.99). The continence rate was significantly better in the RALP group in every period after surgery (p=0.01, <0.001, 0.001, and p=0.02 at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively).

Gut dysbiosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Objective: To investigate the effect of synbiotic supplementation in children with NAFLD. Materials and Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted during February to October 2016. All subjects had NAFLD defined by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value of greater than 225 dB/m without other causes of fatty liver. Participants received either a mixture of chicory inulin, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis or placebo for 16 weeks. Body mass index (BMI), serum alanine transaminase (ALT), and liver stiff ness measurement (LSM) with simultaneous CAP determination were assessed at baseline and after the completion of the intervention. Body mass index Z-score adjusted for age and sex was determined according to the 2007 WHO child growth references. Results: There were 18 (78% male) and 19 (58% male) children in synbiotic and placebo groups. Children in intervention group had significantly greater mean age than those in placebo group (13.3+2.1 vs. 11.26+2.7 years, p = 0.02). There was no difference of baseline BMI Z-score, serum ALT, CAP, and LSM between the two groups. After the completion of the intervention, BMI Z-score significantly decreased in both groups. The reduction of CAP value tended to be significant in the placebo group (p = 0.047). The median (IQR) between-group difference in change from baseline for BMI Z-score, serum ALT, CAP, and LSM values were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The present study is unable to demonstrate the beneficial effect of this particular synbiotic on BMI and hepatic derangement in children with NAFLD. The search for appropriate prebiotic type, dosage and strain of probiotic as well as the duration of treatment for pediatric NAFLD is still required."

Additionally, there have also been worldwide increases in herbal-induced liver injury (HILI) and supplement-induced liver injury (SILI). Studies on DILI, HILI, and SILI have shown that liver injury is the result of an idiosyncratic reaction and was geographically distinct. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of DILI, HILI, and SILI in a Thai population. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively included patients (both outpatients and inpatients) who were diagnosed with DILI-HILI-SILI at a tertiary care university hospital setting from January 2014 to December 2019. The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) score was used to assess causality in suspected cases with a cut-off score of >3. R ratio was used to identify the 3 types of liver injury: hepatocellular, cholestasis, or mixed type. Results: Seventy patients were suspected to have DILI during the study period. Twenty-three patients were excluded due to incomplete data or RUCAM score <3. The remaining 47 patients were included. Of these, 26 cases (55.3%) were due to herbs or supplements and 17 (36.2%) were admitted for a high degree of liver injury. Chinese traditional complementary (12.7%) and multi-herbal products (12.7%) were the common causes of HILI and SILI, respectively. Antimicrobial agents (19.1%) and analgesics (10.6%) were the common causes of conventional drug-induced liver damage. The liver injury patterns in DILI from conventional drugs were hepatocellular (R>5) in 47.6% and cholestatic pattern (R<2) in 33.3%, which was not significantly different (p>0.05). For the HILI and SILI groups, the liver injury patterns were hepatocellular in 46.2% and cholestatic pattern in 15.4% (p = ns). The duration of exposure to diagnosis was similar between the DILI and HILI-SILI groups (3.7 vs. 5.6 months, p = 0.42). The DILI group had longer hospital stay than the HILI and SILI groups (13.5 vs. 7 days; p = 0.63). The overall mortality rate was 2.9%, with one death in each group. Conclusion: Herbal and dietary supplements played an important role in DILI and showed a trend of shorter hospital stays. Hepatocellular liver injury pattern was the most common clinical finding in patients with DILI, HILI, and SILI."

Objective: To evaluate the outcome of GERD patients at 12 months after fundoplication. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study includes children who were diagnosed GERD and underwent fundoplication between January 2006 and December 2018 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Studied outcomes were the need of antireflux medications, prevalence of persistent symptoms, GERD-related hospitalization rate, re-operation rate, and mortality rate at 12 months after fundoplication. Results: Overall, 59 patients (49% male) were included in the present study. The median age (IQR) at the time of GERD diagnosis and fundoplication was 11 (5 to 48) and 18 (8 to 66) months, respectively. All children had comorbid conditions, the most common of which was neurological impairment (n = 48, 81%). Fifty-seven and 2 patients underwent Nissen and Thal fundoplication, respectively. At 12-month follow-up, 30 (51%) were prescribed antireflux medications and 25 (42%) had persistent GERD symptoms. The median (IQR) hospitalization rate was 2.5 (2 to 3) times/year. Only 1 (1.7%) patient, who had esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula, underwent reoperation due to fundoplication disruption. There were 9 deaths (15.3%). Causes of death were GERD-related aspiration pneumonia (n = 1), sepsis (n = 5), hospital-acquired pneumonia (n = 2), and recurrent ependymoma (n = 1). Conclusion: Most patients with GERD who have comorbid conditions have persistent symptoms and need continuing antireflux medications after fundoplication. Therefore, long-term follow-up of GERD patients following fundoplication is essential, particularly those at risk of a high failure rate of fundoplication."

The results are compared to calculations at leading and next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant using different parton shower models. The variation of the ratio of cross sections with R is well described by calculations including a parton shower model, but not by a leading-order quantum chromodynamics calculation including nonperturbative effects. The agreement between the data and the theoretical predictions for the ratios of cross sections is significantly improved when next-to-leading order calculations with nonperturbative effects are used.

The semen was diluted with Beltsville thawing solution extender supplemented with different concentrations of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin [0 (control), 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5%] in the diluted semen. The semen samples were evaluated using a computer-assisted sperm analysis system to determine sperm motility and sperm kinetic parameters (i.e., the curvilinear velocity, VCL; straight line velocity, VSL; average path velocity, VAP; linearity, LIN; straightness, STR; amplitude of lateral head, ALH; wobble, WOB; and beat cross frequency, BCF). Additionally, sperm viability, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, and plasma membrane integrity were evaluated after 4 (day 0), 72 (day 3), 120 (day 5), and 168 (day 7) h of storage using SYBR-14–ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1), EthD-1, JC-1, and the short hypo-osmotic swelling test, respectively. The analyses were carried out by using the general linear mixed model (MIXED) procedure of SAS. The statistical models for each data set included group, day after storage, and interaction between group and day after storage. The boar was included as a random effect. On day 0 after storage, progressive motility, VCL, VSL, VAP, and plasma membrane integrity of boar sperm in 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation were greater than those in the 0.4 and 0.5% groups (P < 0.05). On day 3 after storage, total motility and progressive motility, VCL, VSL, VAP, LIN, WOB, BCF, and plasma membrane integrity in 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation were significantly greater than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The total motility and progressive motility, VAP, and WOB in 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation were greater than those in the control group on day 5 after storage (P < 0.05). No effects of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation on acrosome integrity and mitochondria activity were found on days 3, 5, and 7 after storage. However, the motility and progressive motility and the values for all sperm kinetic parameters except ALH in 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation were greater than those in the control group on day 7 after storage (P < 0.05). In conclusion, 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation in semen extender improved sperm motility, sperm activity, morphology, and life span in chilled boar sperm."

Wound infiltration with local anesthetics may improve postoperative pain, but true multimodal approaches for achieving analgesia after spinal surgery remain unknown.Questions/purposesIn this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial after lumbar interbody fusion, we asked: (1) Does multimodal analgesia reduce VAS pain scores by a clinically important amount? (2) Does this analgesic approach reduce the amount of morphine patients consume after surgery? (3) Is this approach associated with fewer opioid-related side effects after surgery?MethodsThis study included 80 adult patients undergoing lumbar interbody fusion who were randomized into two groups: A control group (n = 40) who received infiltration of the surgical incision at the end of the procedure with an injection of 0.5% bupivacaine 100 mg (20 mL) and epinephrine 0.5 mg (0.5 mL), and the multimodal group (n = 40), who received wound infiltration with the same approach but with different medications: 0.5% bupivacaine 92.5 mg (18.5 mL), ketorolac 30 mg (1 mL), morphine 5 mg (0.5 mL), and epinephrine 0.5 mg (0.5 mL). There were no between-group differences in the proportion of patients who were male, nor in the mean age, height, weight, preoperative pain score, or surgical time. All treatments were administered by one surgeon. All patients, the surgeon, and the researchers were blinded to the allocation of patients to each group. Pain at rest was recorded using the VAS. Postoperative morphine consumption (administered using a patient-controlled analgesia pump) and opiod-associated side effects including nausea/vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, and respiratory depression were assessed; this study was analyzed according to intention-to-treat principles. No loss to follow-up or protocol deviations were noted. We considered a 2-cm change on a 10-cm scale on the VAS as the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Differences smaller than this were considered unlikely to be important.ResultsAt no point were there between-group differences in the VAS scores that exceeded the MCID, indicating no clinically important reductions in pain associated with administering multimodal injections. The highest treatment effect was observed at 3 hours that showed only a -1.3 cm mean difference between the multimodal and the control groups (3.2 ± 1.8 versus 4.5 ± 1.9 [95% CI -1.3 to -0.3]; p < 0.001), which was below the MCID. Morphine consumption was very slightly higher in the control group than in the multimodal group (2.8 ± 2.8 versus 0.3 ± 1.0, mean difference 2.47; p < 0.001). The percentage of patients reporting opioid-related side effects was lower in the multimodal group than in the control group. The proportions of nausea and vomiting were higher in the control group (30% [12 of 40] than in the multimodal group (3% [1 of 40]; p = 0.001). All of these side effects were transient and none was severe.ConclusionsMultimodal wound infiltration with an NSAID and morphine did not yield any clinically important reduction in pain or opioid consumption. Since no substantial benefit of adding these drugs to a patient's aftercare regimen was achieved, and considering the potential risks of administering opioids and NSAIDs (such as, polypharmacy in older patients, serious adverse effects of NSAIDs), we recommend against routine use of this approach in clinical practice.Level of EvidenceLevel I, therapeutic study."
['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"Inclusive search for highly boosted Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV  2020, The Author(s).A search for standard model Higgs bosons (H) produced with transverse momentum (pT) greater than 450 GeV and decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs (b b ¯) is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at s = 13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb−1. The search is inclusive in the Higgs boson production mode. Highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs bosons decaying to b b ¯ are reconstructed as single large-radius jets, and are identified using jet substructure and a dedicated b tagging technique based on a deep neural network. The method is validated with Z →b b ¯ decays. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events above the background assuming no Higgs boson production is observed with a local significance of 2.5 standard deviations (σ), while the expectation is 0.7. The corresponding signal strength and local significance with respect to the standard model expectation are μH = 3.7 ± 1.2(stat)−0.7+0.8(syst)−0.5+0.8(theo) and 1.9 σ.

The koi showed lethargy, loss of swimming activity, were lying at the bottom of the pond, and gasping at the water’s surface. Some clinical signs such as skin hemorrhages and ulcers, swelling of the primary gill lamella, and necrosis of gill tissue, presented. Clinical examination showed co-infection by opportunistic pathogens including Dactylogyrus sp., Gyrodactylus sp. and Saprolegnia sp. on the skin and gills. Histopathologically, the gill of infected fish showed severe necrosis of epithelial cells and infiltrating of eosinophilic granular cells. Electron microscope examination detected few numbers of virions were present in the cytoplasm of gill tissue which showed an electron dense core with surface membranes worn by surface globular units. Molecular detection of CEV DNA from gill samples of fish was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed by nested-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that CEV isolate had 99.8% homology with the CEV isolated from South Korea (KY946715) and Germany (KY550420), and was assigned to genogroup IIa.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Aim This study aimed to identify differences in physical performance across various socioeconomic groups within an older population and to convert those differences into a common metric to facilitate comparisons of aging speed across socioeconomic subgroups. Methods We employed data from the 2009 National Health Examination Survey of Thailand. Physical performance was assessed using three health characteristics: grip strength, as a measure of upper body strength; walking speed, as a measure of lower body strength; and a combined measure of grip strength and walking speed, to capture the strength of the whole body. Education level and income were used to distinguish socioeconomic subpopulations. We followed a characteristic-based age approach to transform these population characteristics, which were measured in different units, into a common and comparable aging metric, referred to as α − age. Results Physical aging trajectories varied by sex and socioeconomic status. Some education, particularly secondary or higher education levels, was significantly associated with greater physical strength in older age for both men and women, whereas higher income was significantly associated with physical strength only for men. Across the three health characteristics, having a primary education slowed age-related declines by up to 6.3 years among men and 2.8 years among women, whereas being in a higher income group slowed age-related declines by 8.2 years among men and up to 4.9 years among women. Conclusions This study adds new evidence from a developing Asian country regarding the difference in aging speeds across subpopulations associated with different levels of education and income."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Rhinacanthus nasutus (L.) Kurz (Acanthaceae) (Rn) is an herbaceous shrub native to Thailand and much of South and Southeast Asia. It has several synonyms and local or common names. The root of Rn is used in Thai traditional medicine to treat snake bites, and the roots and/or leaves can be made into a balm and applied to the skin for the treatment of skin infections such as ringworm, or they may be brewed to form an infusion for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Rn leaves are available to the public for purchase in the form of “tea bags” as a natural herbal remedy for a long list of disorders, including diabetes, skin diseases (antifungal, ringworm, eczema, scurf, herpes), gastritis, raised blood pressure, improved blood circulation, early-stage tuberculosis antitumor activity, and as an antipyretic. There have been many studies investigating the roles of Rn or compounds isolated from the herb regarding diseases such as Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes and infection with bacteria, fungi or viruses. There have, however, been no clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of Rn in the treatment of any of these disorders, and the safety of these teas over long periods of consumption has never been tested. This review assesses the recent research into the role of Rn and its constituent compounds in a range of diseases."

PSI-MS was used to accelerate and monitor the time course of the reaction of dansyl chloride with aniline, in acetonitrile, to produce dansyl aniline. Three distinct PSI arrangements were explored in this study representing alternative approaches for sample loading and interaction; conventional single tip as well as two novel setups, a dual-tip and a co-axial arrangement were designed so as to limit any on-paper interaction between reagents. The effect on product abundance was investigated using these different paper configurations as it relates to the time course and distance of microdroplet travel. It was observed that product yield increases at a given distance and then decreases thereafter for all PSI configurations. The fluorescent property of the product (dansyl aniline) was used to visually inspect the reaction progress on the paper substrate during the spraying process. Amongst the variety of sample loading methods the novel dual-tip arrangement showed an increased product yield and microdroplet density, whilst avoiding any on-paper interaction between the reagents."

We investigate the N = 2 preserving exactly marginal operators of 3d S-fold SCFTs. Two families of such theories are considered: one is constructed by gauging the diagonal flavour symmetry of the T(U(2)) and T(U(3)) theories, and the other by gauging the diagonal flavour symmetry of the T[212][212](SU(4)) theory. In both families, it is possible to turn on a Chern-Simons level for each gauge group and to couple to each theory various numbers of hypermultiplets. The detailed analysis of the exactly marginal operators, along with the superconformal indices, allows us to determine whether supersymmetry gets enhanced in the infrared and to deduce the amount of supersymmetry of the corresponding SCFT."
['Environmental Engineering'],"Application of cell immobilization technology to promote nitritation: A review  2020 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.Nitritation, the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite without subsequent oxidation to nitrate, is a starting step for nitrite-based nitrogen removal approaches. This process can be induced by maintaining specific operating conditions that facilitate ammonia oxidation but deteriorate nitrite oxidation. In recent years, a number of publications have demonstrated the ability of cell immobilization to maintain nitritation and an oxygen-limiting strategy was suggested to be a key to the success of the approach. However, several aspects related to the success and failure of such systems remains unclear and requires further in-depth clarification. This review provides current information on the utilization of cell immobilization in nitritation reactors. Common operating strategies that promote nitritation by controlling environmental conditions are summarized in the first part of the review. The application of cell immobilization, including cell attachment, cell granulation, and cell entrapment systems, as well as microenvironments, and microbial distributions within cell immobilization matrices, are elaborated in the middle part of the review. Problems encountered in the operation of nitritation reactors using cell immobilization are discussed as opportunities for further research at the end of the review."
['Gastroenterology'],"Genistein attenuated gastric inflammation and apoptosis in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastropathy in rats  2020, The Author(s).Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer diseases and cancer. Genistein (4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), a tyrosine-specific-protein kinase inhibitor, has been shown to exert an anti-inflammatory property. The aim of this study was to examine the treatment effects of genistein and its mechanisms in rats with H. pylori infection. Methods: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (6 rats per group): (1) control group (Con); (2) H. pylori infected group (HP): the rats were inoculated with H. pylori (108− 1010 CFU/mL; 1 mL/rat.) for 3 consecutive days; and (3) HP + genistein group (HP + Gen): the rats were inoculated with H. pylori as above. Then, they were gavaged with genistein (16 mg/kg BW) for 14 days. Gastric tissue was used for the determination of nuclear factor (NF)-κB expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), degree of apoptosis by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) reaction, and histopathology. Serum samples were used to measure the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1). Results: Rats in the HP group had significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, NF-κB expression and apoptotic cells when compared with the Con group, and these markers significantly decreased in HP + Gen group when compared with the HP group. The histopathology of HP group showed moderate gastric inflammation and many HP colonization. Gastric pathology in HP + Gen group demonstrated the attenuation of inflammatory cell infiltration and H. pylori colonization. Conclusion: Genistein exerted its gastroprotective effects through the reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, nuclear receptor NF-κB expression and gastric mucosal apoptosis in rats with H. pylori-induced gastropathy."

Data concerning the skin findings exclusively in post-BaS patients remain limited. Methods: Seventy post-BaS patients were examined for cutaneous abnormalities. The patients were divided into those with successful weight loss (% excessive body weight loss (EBWL) of at least 50%) and a non-successful group (%EBWL < 50%). Results: Forty-six patients with successful weight loss demonstrated a significantly lower prevalence of acanthosis nigricans on the neck, axillae and inguinal areas, keratosis pilaris (KP) and pebble fingers. However, a higher prevalence of alopecia was observed. After adjustment with patients’ factors, KP (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.21, 95%CI 0.06–0.74, p = 0.02) and pebble fingers (aOR = 0.09, 95%CI 0.01–0.89, p = 0.04) remained significantly less likely in patients with successful weight loss. Laboratory results comparing pre- and post-surgery values revealed significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and triglyceride and an increase of high-density lipoproteins in both groups. However, significant decreases of liver aminotransferases (AST and ALT) were observed only in the successful group (p = 0.04, 0.003). Nonetheless, a decrease in vitamin B12 (p = 0.01) was observed in the successful group. Conclusion: Weight loss after BaS provided an improvement for metabolic profiles. Successful weight reduction resulted in better skin improvement. However, nutritional supplements may be necessary. Trial registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20171003002.

All rights reserved.Despite the significant improvement in survival outcomes of multiple myeloma (MM) over the past decade, it remains an incurable disease. Patients with triple-class refractory MM have limited treatment options and a dismal prognosis. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen has transformed the treatment armamentarium of relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM), with unprecedented overall response rates in this difficult-to-treat patient population. However, a significant proportion of patients ultimately relapse despite achieving deep remission. Several innovative approaches, including alternative/dual-antigen-specific CAR T-cell constructs, genetically engineered “off-the-shelf” CAR T cells, and strategies to counteract an immunosuppressive microenvironment, may dramatically reshape the field of CAR T-cell therapy in the future. These strategies are being actively investigated in preclinical and early clinical trial settings with the hopes of enhancing the durability of responses and, thereby, improving the overall survival of RRMM patients after CAR T-cell therapy."
['Hematology'],"Thrombolytic therapy in acute venous thromboembolism  2020 American Society of Hematology. All rights reserved.Although anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), the use of thrombolytic agents or thrombectomy is required to immediately restore blood flow to thrombosed vessels. Nevertheless, systemic thrombolysis has not clearly been shown to improve outcomes in patients with large clot burdens in the lung or legs as compared with anticoagulation alone; this is in part due to the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage in a small percentage of patients to whom therapeutic doses of a thrombolytic drug are administered. Algorithms have been developed to identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes resulting from large clot burdens and at low risk for major bleeding in an effort to improve outcomes in those receiving thrombolytic therapy. In acute pulmonary embolism (PE), hemodynamic instability is the key determinant of short-term survival and should prompt consideration of immediate thrombolysis. In hemodynamically stable PE, systemic thrombolysis is not recommended and should be used as rescue therapy if clinical deterioration occurs. Evidence is accumulating regarding the efficacy of administering reduced doses of thrombolytic agents systemically or via catheters directly into thrombi in an effort to lower bleed rates. In acute deep venous thrombosis, catheter-directed thrombolysis with thrombectomy can be used in severe or limb-threatening thrombosis but has not been shown to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. Because the management of acute VTE can be complex, having a rapid-response team (ie, PE response team) composed of physicians from different specialties may aid in the management of severely affected patients."

The efficiency of polysaccharides extracted from sea grapes for prebiotic properties was conducted by comparing the growth of probiotic bacteria Bacillus subtilis at different concentrations in co-cultured with pathogenic bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a gram-negative motile bacterium that inhabits marine and estuarine environments throughout the world, causes of violent diseases outbreak in aquatic animals. The experimental research was 4 treatments with 4 replications including control group (LB broth), extracted sea grape enrichment in LB broth at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.7 mg.C/l. The result showed that the highest growth of probiotic bacteria appeared significantly at extracted sea grape in LB broth with 0.5 mg.C/l (1.64×107 ± 6.04×106 cfu/ml). The said concentration was used as benchmark to clarify the pathogenic resistance. The comparison between monoculture of probiotic bacteria and co-culture of probiotic bacteria plus pathogenic bacteria indicated that there was non significantly different in growth of the bacterias. Hence extracted polysaccharides from sea graps (C. lentilifera) had potential to be utilized not only as a growth enrichment of probiotic bacteria but also inhibiting pathogenic bacteria."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The effects of chili on gastric accommodation (GA) in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients have not been explored. Methods: In total, 15 healthy volunteers (HV) and 15 pH-positive non-erosive GERD (NERD) patients underwent single-photon emission computed tomography after ingesting 2 g of chili or placebo in capsules in a randomized double-blind crossover fashion with a one-week washout period. GA was the maximal postprandial gastric volume (GV) after 250 mL of Ensure® minus the fasting GV. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated by using a visual analog scale. Results: NERD patients but not HV had significantly greater GA after chili compared to a placebo (451 ± 89 vs. 375 ± 81 mL, p < 0.05). After chili, the postprandial GVs at 10, 20, and 30 min in NERD patients were significantly greater than HV (10 min, 600 ± 73 vs. 526 ± 70 mL; 20 min, 576 ± 81 vs. 492 ± 78 mL; 30 min, 532 ± 81 vs. 466 ± 86 mL, all p < 0.05). In NERD, chili was associated with significantly less satiety, more severe abdominal burning (p < 0.05), and a trend of more severe heartburn (p = 0.06) compared to the placebo. In HV, postprandial symptoms after chili and placebo ingestion were similar (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Chili enhanced GA in NERD patients but not in HV. This suggests that the modulation of GA in NERD is abnormal and likely involves transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) sensitive pathways."

The activity of resveratrol plus antimicrobial agents was determined by checkerboard and time-kill assay against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolated from patients at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Overexpression of efflux pumps that mediates chlorhexidine susceptibility was characterized by the ethidium bromide accumulation assay. The effect of resveratrol on the expression of efflux pump genes (adeB, adeJ, adeG abeS, and aceI) and the two-component regulators, adeR and adeS was determined by RT-qPCR. The combination of resveratrol and chlorhexidine resulted in strong synergistic and bactericidal activity against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Up-regulation of adeB and aceI was induced by chlorhexidine. However, the addition of resveratrol increased chlorhexidine susceptibility with increased intracellular accumulation of ethidium bromide in A. baumannii indicating that resveratrol acts as an efflux pump inhibitor. Expression of adeB was significantly reduced in the combination of resveratrol with chlorhexidine indicating that resveratrol inhibits the AdeB efflux pump and restores chlorhexidine effect on A. baumannii. In conclusion, reduced adeB expression in A. baumannii was mediated by resveratrol suggesting that AdeB efflux pump inhibition contributes to the synergistic mechanism of resveratrol with chlorhexidine. Our finding highlights the potential importance of resveratrol in clinical applications."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background The concerns of people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) about their disease are often different from the objective clinical picture and subject to various influencing factors, including disease progression. Currently our understanding of these concerns is limited, particularly in Asian countries. Methods A 50-item survey on Parkinson’s Disease Patients’ Concerns (PDPC Survey) was developed by a multidisciplinary care team. The subjective greatest concerns (most commonly concerning symptoms) of patients at a specialist centre in Bangkok, Thailand, were explored and categorised according to disease stage and age at onset of PD. Results Data for 222 patients showed concerns varied widely. Motor symptoms giving the greatest concern were problems with walking and/or balance (40.5% of patients), while the most commonly concerning non-motor symptom (NMS) was constipation (41.0%). Patterns were observed amongst different patient subgroups. Early PD patients (H&Y stage 1) were more concerned about NMS than motor symptoms, while the reverse was true for advanced PD patients. Young-onset PD patients showed significantly greater concerns than typical-onset patients about motor symptoms relating to social functioning, working and stigmatisation, such as speech (p = 0.003). Conclusions This study, in an Asian patient cohort, provides an assessment of a wide range of PD patients’ concerns, encompassing not only motor symptoms and NMS, but also treatment-related adverse events, care in the advanced stage, and the need for assistive devices. Identifying the concerns of individual PD patients and implementing a patient-centred approach to care is critical to their wellbeing and optimal outcomes. The PDPC survey can help healthcare teams build a more accurate picture of patients’ experiences to inform clinical management."

By extending the class of fermionic solutions of the Dirac equation in the curved space of wormhole surface to include normal modes with real energy and momentum, we found a quantum selection rule for the scattering of fermion waves to the wormhole. The newly found momentum–angular momentum relation implies that only fermion with the quantized momentum k=m′/aq can be transmitted through the hole. The allowed momentum is proportional to an effective angular momentum quantum number m′ and inversely proportional to the radius of the throat of the wormhole a. Flux dependence of the effective angular momentum quantum number permits us to select fermions that can pass through according to their momenta. A conservation law is also naturally enforced in terms of the unitarity condition among the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. The scattering involving quasinormal modes (QNMs) of fermionic states in the wormhole is subsequently explored. It is found that the transmitted waves through the wormhole for all scenarios involving QNMs are mostly suppressed and decaying in time. In the case of QNMs scattering, the unitarity condition is violated but a more generic relation of the scattering coefficients is established. When the magnetic flux ϕ= mhc/ e, i.e., quantized in units of the magnetic flux quantum hc/e, the fermion will tunnel through the wormhole with zero reflection."

The necessity of incorporating dispersion interactions in the state-of-the-art density functional theory for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (MAPI) is demonstrated in this work. Some of the vdW methods were selected to evaluate the corresponding energetics properties of the cubic MAPI with various azimuthally rotated MA organic cation orientations. The highest energy barrier obtained from PBEsol reaches 18.6 meV/MA-ion, which is equivalent to 216 K, the temperature above which the MA cations randomly reorient. Energy profiles calculated by vdW incorporated functionals, on the other hand, exhibit various distinct patterns. The well-developed vdW-DF-cx functional was selected, thanks to its competence, to evaluate the total energies of different MA dipolar configurations in 2 × 2 × 2 cubic supercell of MAPI under pressures. The centrosymmetric arrangement of the MA cations that provide zero total dipole moment configuration results in the lowest energy state profiles under pressure, while the non-centrosymmetric scheme displays a unique behaviour. Despite being overall unpolarised, the latter calculated with PBEsol leads to a rigid shift of energy from the profile obtained from the dispersive vdW-DF-cx functional. It is noteworthy that the energy profile responsible for the maximum polarised configuration nevertheless takes the second place in total energy under pressure."

DM increases the risk of infections caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. We examined the prevalence, subtypes, and risk factors of Blastocystis infection in patients with and without DM in central Thailand. Stool samples and questionnaires were obtained from 130 people in the DM group and 100 people in the non-DM group. Blastocystis infection was identified via a nested polymerase chain reaction and subtyped via sequencing of the partial small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene. Analysis of potential risk factors was conducted via binary logistic regression. The overall prevalence of Blastocystis infection was 10.8%, including rates of 9% and 12.3% in the non-DM and DM groups, respectively. The most prevalent subtype was ST3, followed by ST1, and ST4. Factors that potentially increased the risk of Blastocystis infection include patients being >65 years old, the presence of DM, a DM duration of ≥10 years, a low level of education, and animal ownership. In conclusion, this is the first study of Blastocystis infection in DM, and a high prevalence was found among this population. Therefore, health education promoting sanitation and hygiene is necessary to reduce and prevent infection in the community."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS), a natural polymer derived from chitosan, exerts several biological activities including anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, anti-metabolic syndrome, and drug delivery enhancer. Since COS is vastly distributed to kidney and eliminated in urine, it may have a potential advantage as the therapeutics of kidney diseases. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common genetic disorder characterized by multiple fluid-filled cysts, replacing normal renal parenchyma and leading to impaired renal function and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The effective treatment for PKD still needs to be further elucidated. Interestingly, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been proposed as a drug target for PKD. This study aimed to investigate the effect of COS on renal cyst enlargement and its underlying mechanisms. We found that COS at the concentrations of 50 and 100 µg/mL decreased renal cyst growth without cytotoxicity, as measured by MTT assay. Immunoblotting analysis showed that COS at 100 µg/mL activated AMPK, and this effect was abolished by STO-609, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKKβ) inhibitor. Moreover, COS elevated the level of intracellular calcium. These results suggest that COS inhibits cyst progression by activation of AMPK via CaMKKβ. Therefore, COS may hold the potential for pharmaceutical application in PKD."

Clinical studies show an association between CD and depression and preclinical evidence suggests that depressive-like behaviors in T. cruzi infected mice are due, at least partially, to immune dysregulation. However, mechanistic studies regarding this issue are still lacking. Herein, we present and discuss the state of art of data on CD and depression, and revise the mechanisms that may explain the development of depression in CD. We also discuss how the knowledge generated by current and future data may contribute to the discovery of new mechanisms underlying depressive symptoms associated with CD and, hence, to the identification of new therapeutic targets, which ultimately may change the way we see and treat CD and its psychiatric comorbidities."

This has a protection level II according to the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 0106.01 standard. The effects of MWCNTs mass content in a range of 0 to 2 wt% on tensile, physical and ballistic impact properties of the nanocomposite were investigated. The results revealed that the introduction of MWCNTs enhanced the tensile strength and energy at break of the nanocomposite; the highest values were obtained at 0.25 wt%. In addition, the nanocomposite laminate with 20 plies of aramid fabric showed the lowest back face deformation of 8 mm which was much lower than that specified by the NIJ standard. According to Military Standard (MIL-STD) 662F, the simulation prediction revealed that the ballistic limit of the ballistic helmet nanocomposite was as high as 632 m s−1.

There is lack of guidance on optimal UF practice. We aimed to explore patterns of UF practice, barriers to achieving UF targets, and concerns related to UF practice among practitioners working in Europe. Methods: This was a sub-study of an international open survey with focus on adult intensivists and nephrologists, advanced practice providers, and ICU and dialysis nurses working in Europe. Results: Four hundred eighty-five practitioners (75% intensivists) from 31 countries completed the survey. The most common criteria for UF initiation was persistent oliguria/anuria (45.6%), followed by pulmonary edema (16.7%). Continuous renal replacement therapy was the preferred initial modality (90.0%). The median initial and maximal rate of net ultrafiltration (UFNET) prescription in hemodynamically stable patients were 149 mL/hr. (IQR 100–200) and 300 mL/hr. (IQR 201–352), respectively, compared to a median UFNET rate of 98 mL/hr. (IQR 51–108) in hemodynamically unstable patients and varied significantly between countries. Two-thirds of nurses and 15.5% of physicians reported assessing fluid balance hourly. When hemodynamic instability occurred, 70.1% of practitioners reported decreasing the rate of fluid removal, followed by starting or increasing the dose of a vasopressor (51.3%). Most respondents (90.7%) believed in early fluid removal and expressed willingness to participate in a study comparing protocol-based fluid removal versus usual care. Conclusions: There was a significant variation in UF practice and perception among practitioners in Europe. Future research should focus on identifying the best strategies of prescribing and managing ultrafiltration in critically ill patients."
"['Catalysis', 'Process Chemistry and Technology']","Effect of immobilization methods on the production of polyethylene-cellulose biocomposites via ethylene polymerization with metallocene/MAO catalyst Copyright  2020 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.Polyethylene-cellulose biocomposites were synthesized here via the ethylene polymerization with metallocene as a catalyst along with methylaluminoxane (MAO) as a cocatalyst. The immobilization method in which the catalyst or cocatalyst is fixed onto the catalytic filler (cellulose) can be classified into 3 methods according to the active components fixed onto the filler surface: 1) only metallocene catalyst (Cellulose/Zr), 2) only MAO cocatalyst (Cellulose/MAO) and 3) mixture of metallocene and MAO (Cellulose/(Zr+MAO)). It was found that the different immobilization methods or different fillers altered the properties of the obtained composites and also the catalytic activity of the polymerization systems. It was found that Cellulose/MAO provided the highest catalytic activity among all fillers due to a crown-alumoxane complex, which caused the heterogeneous system with this filler behaved similarly to the homogeneous system. The different fillers also produced the biocomposites with some different properties such as crystallinity which Cellulose/Zr provided the highest crystallinity compared with other fillers as observed by a thermal gravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC). Nevertheless, the main crystal structure indicated to the typical polyethylene was still observed for all obtained biocomposites with different fillers as observed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD)."
"['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging']","Detection of Extrapulmonary Malignancy During Lung Cancer Screening: 5-Year Analysis at a Tertiary Hospital  2020 American College of RadiologyPurpose: The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and outcomes of extrapulmonary malignancies identified on lung cancer screening (LCS) and to determine the cost associated with the investigation of these lesions. Methods: This retrospective study included 7,414 low-dose CT studies performed between June 2014 and December 2019 on 4,160 patients as part of an established LCS program. Patients with indeterminate extrapulmonary lesions were identified, and the diagnostic workup, management, and outcomes of the lesions were determined. Costs related to diagnostic evaluation were estimated using 2020 total facility relative value units and the 2020 Medicare conversion factor. Out-of-pocket costs were extracted from billing records. Results: There were 20 extrapulmonary malignancies among 241 reported lesions in 225 patients (mean age, 66.1 ± 6.4 years; 109 men, 116 women). The prevalence of extrapulmonary malignancy was 20 of 4,160 (0.48%). Early-stage cancers were detected in 13 of 20 (65%). No cancer-specific mortality was observed. The predictive value for malignancy varied by organ (P = .03) and was highest in the chest wall and axilla (36.4%), followed by bone (25%). The average cost on the basis of Medicare reimbursement for diagnosis of an extrapulmonary malignancy on LCS was $1,316.03 ($6.33 per participant and $109.21 per indeterminate incidental lesion). Most patients (203 of 225 [90.2%]) did not have out-of-pocket costs related to diagnostic workup. In those who did, the median cost was $160.60 (range, $75-$606.76). Conclusions: Low-dose CT for LCS detects extrapulmonary malignancy with high predictive value for certain locations. There is cost associated in the workup related to these incidental lesions, but most malignancies are detected at early stages and have good outcomes."
['Materials Science (miscellaneous)'],"Compressive behavior of extremely low strength concrete conﬁned with low-cost glass FRP composites  2020 The AuthorsIn this study, a total of 24 cylindrical concrete specimens were constructed and strengthened using locally available and Low-Cost Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (LC-GFRPs) composites. The considered research parameters were the strength of un-confined concrete (5 MPa and 15 MPa) and the confinement level (one, two, and three layers of LC-GFRP). The specimens were tested to failure under pure axial compression. The results indicate that LC-GFRPs are very beneficial to modify the ultimate load-carrying capacity and ductility of the confined concrete. In the end, the existing expressions, developed mainly for special purpose traditional FRPs to estimate the ultimate strength and strain of the confined concrete, were utilized to assess their application to the LC-GFRP confined concrete. It was found that all considered models are well capable to estimate the ultimate strength of LC-GFRP confined concrete but those models were not able to accurately predict the ultimate strain of the LC-GFRP confined concrete."

The present study aimed to determine factors influencing pre-ovulatory follicle diameter and weaning-to-ovulation interval (WOI) in spontaneously ovulating sows in tropical climates with special emphasis on breed, parity and backfat thickness at weaning. In total, 80 sows were included in the study. Follicle development was determined by using transrectal real-time B-mode ultrasonography every 6 hr after standing oestrus. Weaning-to-oestrous interval (WEI), oestrous-to-ovulation interval (EOI), WOI and the diameter of graafian follicles were investigated in relation to breed, parity number (1, 2–3 and 4–7) and backfat thickness (low, moderate and high) of sows. Overall, WEI, EOI, WOI and the pre-ovulatory follicle diameter were 92.5 ± 21.6 hr, 64.3 ± 19.3 hr, 156.3 ± 29.1 hr and 10.3 ± 2.0 mm, respectively. Pre-ovulatory follicle size was smaller in primiparous sows compared with sows of greater parity, 4–7 (9.7 ± 0.51 and 11.7 ± 0.52 mm, respectively, p <.05). Weaning-to-ovulation interval was positively correlated with WEI (r = 0.75, p <.001) and EOI (r = 0.66, p <.001), but negatively correlated with size of the graafian follicle (r = –0.34, p <.01). Sows with a shorter WEI had a larger pre-ovulatory follicle diameter (at 64 hr after oestrus) (r = –0.37, p <.01). Sows with low backfat thickness had a WOI 23.4 hr longer than those with moderate backfat thickness (p <.05) and 17.6 hr longer than sows with a high backfat thickness (p =.140). The follicle diameter in primiparous sows with high backfat thickness (11.7 ± 1.1 mm) was higher than in those with low (8.9 ± 0.7 mm, p <.05) or moderate (8.6 ± 0.8, p <.05) backfat thickness. In conclusion, factors influencing follicle diameter and WOI in sows included parity number and backfat thickness at weaning. The impact of backfat thickness on follicle diameter, WEI and WOI was most pronounced in primiparous sows."

Acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation using immobilized Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026 on Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) chemically pretreated with H2SO4, NaOH, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM-OAc) was compared in order to investigate the effect of the treatment on butanol production. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and surface area measurement analyses indicated that the alkaline-pretreated Napier grass sample had the highest crystalline level with the lowest lignin content (lignin/cellulose) and a high surface area compared with other pretreated samples, suggesting its potential as an immobilized material. The fermentation was operated in a batch system for 5 days with an initial glucose level of 60 g/L. Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026 immobilized on the NaOH-treated Napier grass gave the highest butanol concentration (8.99 g/L), which corresponded to a 24.7% and 25.6% higher concentration than that when the cells were immobilized on untreated Napier grass and free cell culture, respectively. It is likely that immobilization on NaOH-treated Napier grass increased the cells’ protection from environmental stresses and prevented their washing out due to its swollen structure within an enlarged surface area."

The crystalline structure, morphology, and surface texture of the obtained TiO2 NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm, field emission-scanning electron microscopy, and high resolution-transmission electron microscopy analyses. Under a larger HNO3: TTIP molar ratio, higher hydrothermal temperature, and higher hydrothermal time, the spherical mixed anatase–rutile phase TiO2 NPs were converted to a nanorod (NR)-shaped rutile phase (TiO2-R). The TiO2-R NRs gave the highest methanol conversion level (65%) and hydrogen yield (45%) in the oxidative steam reforming of methanol at 400 °C."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Systems biology analysis of osteogenic differentiation behavior by canine mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow and dental pulp  2020, The Author(s).Utilization of canine mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs) for regenerating incorrigible bone diseases has been introduced. However, cMSCs harvested from different sources showed distinct osteogenicity. To clarify this, comparative proteomics-based systems biology analysis was used to analyze osteogenic differentiation behavior by cMSCs harvested from bone marrow and dental pulp. The results illustrated that canine dental pulp stem cells (cDPSCs) contained superior osteogenicity comparing with canine bone marrow-derived MSCs (cBM-MSCs) regarding alkaline phosphatase activity, matrix mineralization, and osteogenic marker expression. Global analyses by proteomics platform showed distinct protein clustering and expression pattern upon an in vitro osteogenic induction between them. Database annotation using Reactome and DAVID revealed contrast and unique expression profile of osteogenesis-related proteins, particularly on signaling pathways, cellular components and processes, and cellular metabolisms. Functional assay and hierarchical clustering for tracking protein dynamic change confirmed that cBM-MSCs required the presences of Wnt, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and bone-morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, while cDPSCs mainly relied on BMP signaling presentation during osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Therefore, these findings illustrated the comprehensive data regarding an in vitro osteogenic differentiation behavior by cBM-MSCs and cDPSCs which is crucial for further mechanism study and the establishment of cMSC-based bone tissue engineering (BTE) for veterinary practice."

Microstructural observations of the extruded Ti-(N) samples before homogenization, ExTi-(N), revealed the nitrogen element's segregated regions as a result of a short time of the SPS process. Because of the inadequate sintering time, nitrogen atoms were unable to dissolve in the α-Ti matrix homogeneously, which caused a material degradation through brittle failure initiating at high nitrogen absorbed regions. Applying homogenization heat treatment at 1123 K for 180 min followed by hot extrusion, improved microstructural homogeneity without the nitrogen segregation. Furthermore, grain morphology was transformed from coarse elongated grains with substructures into refined equiaxed α-Ti grains. The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the Ti-(N) sample with 0.69 wt%N reached maximum 957 MPa and 1117 MPa, respectively, which represented 148% and 214% increments over as-extruded pure Ti sample. In addition, a 50% enhancement of elongation of homogenized Ti-(N) alloys compared to the non-homogenizing condition was achieved. The improvement of strength and elongation was primarily attributed to grain refinement and solid solution strengthening. The quantitative evaluation of strengthening and mechanisms was discussed in detail by the Hall-Petch formula and Labusch model."

The proposed network structure can be used for problems where input and/or output are defined on a manifold triangle mesh with or without boundary. We demonstrate its applications in cloth upsampling, adding back details to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) compressed cloth, regressing clothing deformation from character poses, and regressing hand skin deformation from bones' joint angles. The data used for training in this work are generated from high resolution extended position based dynamics (XPBD) physics simulations with small time steps and high iteration counts and from an offline FEM simulator, but it can come from other sources. The inference time of our prototype implementation, depending on the mesh resolution and the network size, can provide between 4 to 134 times faster than a GPU based simulator. The inference also only needs to be done for meshes currently visible by the camera."

Because of their high capacity for milk synthesis, dairy ruminants have been distributed throughout the world. In tropical areas, dairy animals face high ambient temperatures (HTa). The indirect effect of HTa on milk synthesis is mediated in part by a reduction in feed intake. The current experiment focused on the direct natural effect of HTa on mammary function. Multiparous Saanen goats were used in this study. The physiological responses for HTa were evaluated from the control period during the winter and from the natural HTa during the summer. Milk samples were collected for isolation of the goat milk cells to study the expression of the β-1,4 galactosyltransferase (β-GALT1), Akt, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) genes. Although goats in the summer maintained rectal temperature and plasma cortisol levels similar to those observed in the winter, the higher respiratory rate and lower feed intake and milk yield (MY) from the goats in the summer indicated that the goats in the summer were exposed to a higher degree of HTa. This was supported by the significantly higher level of plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. Moreover, the relative expression levels of β-GALT1 and Akt were not different. The relative expression of HSP70 during the summer was significantly higher than what was observed in cells isolated in the winter. In conclusion, the HTa effect on MY during the summer was related to its indirect effect on feed intake. The direct HTa effect might be related to HSP70 gene expression in goat milk cells and to plasma GPX activity. However, the natural HTa did not affect the expression of Akt or β-GALT1."

Hence, this study sought to explore the anti-adhesion activity of C. longa extract and Curcumin against Acanthamoeba triangularis trophozoites and cysts in plastic and contact lenses. Our results showed that C. longa extract and Curcumin significantly inhibited the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites and cysts to the plastic surface, as investigated by the crystal violet assay (P < 0.05). Also, an 80–90% decrease in adhesion of trophozoites and cysts to the plastic surface was detected following the treatment with C. longa extract and Curcumin at 1/2 × MIC, compared to the control. In the contact lens model, approximately 1 log cells/mL of the trophozoites and cysts was reduced when the cells were treated with Curcumin, when compared to the control. Pre-treatment of the plastic surface with Curcumin at 1/2-MIC reduced 60% and 90% of the adhesion of trophozoites and cysts, respectively. The reduction in 1 Log cells/mL of the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites was observed when lenses were pre-treated with both the extract and Curcumin. Base on the results obtained from this study, A. triangularis trophozoites treated with C. longa extract and Curcumin have lost strong acanthopodia, thorn-like projection pseudopodia observed by scanning electron microscope. This study also revealed the therapeutic potentials of C. longa extract and Curcumin, as such, have promising anti-adhesive potential that can be used in the management/prevention of A. triangularis adhesion to contact lenses."

This study aims to investigate the association between major depressive episode (MDE) and AUD across various socio-economic groups. Methods: We analysed data from the 2014 Thai National Health Examination Survey containing a random sample of 13,177 adults aged > 20 years from the general population. The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test was used to classify respondents into non-problem drinking (score 0–7), hazardous drinking (score 8–15), and harmful-dependent drinking (score 16–40). MDE was identified using questions based on the DSM-IV. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multinomial logistic regression to determine the strength of associations between MDE as a predictor and AUD as an outcome variable across different socio-economic levels. Results: The prevalence of MDE, hazardous, and harmful-dependent drinking was 2.5, 10.3, and 1.9%, respectively. The association between MDE and AUD was modified by wealth index, education level and area of residence. AORs for the association between MDE and harmful-dependent drinking were high among those in the highest (AOR = 8.68, 95% CI: 5.34, 14.11) and lowest (AOR = 7.14, 95% CI: 3.71, 13.73) levels of wealth index but not significant among those in the middle level (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 0.74, 4.25). Education had the strongest effect on the relationship between MDE and harmful-dependent drinking (AOR = 16.0, 95% CI: 10.30, 24.90 among those completing secondary school or higher and AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.63, 3.33 among those completing primary school only). The association between MDE and harmful-dependent drinking was higher among people who lived in urban areas (AOR = 8.50, 95% CI: 5.50, 13.13) compared to those living in rural areas (AOR = 4.73, 95% CI: 3.31, 6.77). Conclusion: Socio-economic factors modify the association between alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder among Thai people."

The slope of heart rate (fC) versus oxygen uptake (V˙O2), which we call the chronotropic index (CI), can help identify cardiovascular impairment. We aimed to develop a reference equation for CI based on a large number of subjects considered to have normal exercise responses. Methods From a database of 13,728 incremental cycle ergometry exercise tests, we identified 1280 normal tests based on the absence of a clinical diagnosis, normal body mass index, and normal aerobic performance plus absence of cardiovascular disease, medications, or ventilatory limitation. A linear mixed-model approach was used to analyze the relationship between CI and other variables. Results Subjects were age 18-84 yr, and 693 (54.1%) were men. Mean ± SD CI in men was lower than in women, 41.2 ± 9.3 beats per liter versus 63.4 ± 15.7 L-1. Age (in years), sex (0, male; 1, female), height (in centimeters), and weight (in kilograms) were significant predictors for CI:CIi = 106.9 + 0.16 × agei + 14.3 × sexi - 0.31 × heighti - 0.24 × weighti. The SE of estimates ranged from 10.6 to 11.2 L-1 (median of 10.7 L-1). Conclusions We report a reference equation for CI derived from normal subjects. The CI can be used in conjunction with V˙O2max to interpret maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests. We consider a high CI to be cardiovascular impairment and a low CI plus low V˙O2max to be chronotropic insufficiency."

Two linear boundaries were experimentally observed for the transitions between no condensation-induced water hammer and non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and between non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and periodic condensation-induced water hammer. The analytical modeling based on the energy balance equation was conducted to derive the onset of the condensation-induced water hammer. The analytical model suggested that the map of the onset of the condensation-induced water hammer could be displayed by two essential non-dimensional parameters, such as modified Jakob number and Froude number. The model indicated that the slope of the boundary of the onset of the condensation-induced water hammer was the product of modified Stanton number, non-dimensional interfacial area concentration, and non-dimensional temperature difference. The model could predict the boundaries between no condensation-induced water hammer and non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and between non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and periodic condensation-induced water hammer satisfactorily. The one-dimensional nuclear thermal-hydraulic system analysis code, RELAP5, was used for simulating the onset of the condensation-induced water hammer. The obtained boundary corresponded to the experimentally obtained boundary between non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and periodic condensation-induced water hammer."

The continuum-based approach corresponding to the complete version of Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity model is adopted to demonstrate the influence from surface energy. Normal and radial displacement boundary conditions in the contact region corresponding to the frictional indentation problem is formulated in the term of integral equations by employing the relevant displacement Green's function obtained by the use of Hankel integral transform. The contact tractions are solved by applying a collocation technique together with the assumption of a piecewise distribution for the tractions within each discretized annular ring element. The accuracy of proposed solution scheme is validated with existing solutions from classical continuum mechanics for frictional indentation problem of an elastic half-space. Selected numerical results are presented to demonstrate the influence of friction effects on the elastic fields of the layer under the influence of surface energy. It is found that the consideration of frictional contact makes the layer stiffer when compared to the frictionless indentation, and the influence of friction effect is smaller when the surface energy effects are accounted for. In addition, the elastic fields of the layer are clearly size-dependent and the elastic layer becomes stiffer with the presence of surface stresses."

We conducted a longitudinal survey of swine influenza A viruses (S-IAV) circulating in a pig farm with history of endemic S-IAV infection from 2017 to 2018. The samples were collected from 436 pigs including nasal swab samples (n = 436) and blood samples (n = 436). Our result showed that 18.81% (82/436) were positive for influenza A virus and subsequently 57 S-IAV could be isolated. Then 24 out of 57 S-IAVs were selected for whole genome sequencing and could be subtyped as S-IAV-H1N1 (n = 18) and S-IAV-H3N2 (n = 6). Of 24 S-IAVs, we observed 3 genotypes of S-IAVs including rH1N1 (pdm + 1), rH1N1 (pdm + 2), and rH3N2 (pdm + 2). Since all genotypes of S-IAVs in this study contained internal genes from pdmH1N1-2009, it could be speculated that pdmH1N1-2009 was introduced in a pig farm and then multiple reassorted with endemic S-IAVs to generate diversify S-IAV genotypes. Our study supported and added the evidences that pdmH1N1-2009 and it reassortant have predominately persisted in pig population in Thailand. Thus, monitoring of S-IAVs in pigs, farm workers and veterinarians in pig farms is important and should be routinely conducted."

Currently, selective COX-2 inhibitors can provide effective pain reduction with less platelet inhibition compared with conventional NSAIDs. We aimed to compare the analgesic effect and perioperative blood loss (PBL) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between ketorolac and parecoxib administration. Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study of 100 unilateral TKAs. The ketorolac group of 50 patients received an intraoperative periarticular injection (PAI) with 100 mg of bupivacaine and 30 mg of ketorolac. Afterwards, 30 mg of ketorolac was intravenously injected every 12 h until 48 h. In the parecoxib group of 50 patients, 20 mg of parecoxib was added to PAI, and the first intravenous dose was 20 mg followed by 40 mg every 12 h. The primary outcomes were visual analog scales (VASs) of postoperative pain, amount of morphine consumption, PBL, and blood transfusion rate. Results: The ketorolac group had a significantly lower VAS pain score than the parecoxib group at 6 h after TKA (2.38 ± 2.52 vs. 4.12 ± 2.86, P < 0.01). Thereafter, the VAS of both groups and total morphine consumption at 24 and 48 h were comparable. The PBLs of the ketorolac and parecoxib groups were 529.72 ± 263.02 and 402.40 ± 191.47 ml, respectively (P = 0.01). However, the blood transfusion rates between groups were not different. Conclusion: Parecoxib provides comparable analgesic effects to ketorolac. Additionally, perioperative use of parecoxib is safe and is associated with significantly less blood loss after TKA."

Ninety-six BA patients and 56 healthy controls were recruited. Circulating CLU levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Circulating CLU levels were significantly reduced in BA patients – especially those with worse outcomes including jaundice, severe liver fibrosis, and late-stage of hepatic dysfunction. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that circulating CLU levels were negatively associated with outcome parameters indicating jaundice status, degree of fibrosis, and liver dysfunction, but positively correlated with serum albumin and platelet number of BA patients. Lower circulating CLU levels were considerably associated with poor survival of post-operative BA patients. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated a diagnostic value of circulating CLU as a non-invasive indicator for poor outcomes of BA patients (AUC = 0.85), with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 73.5%. All findings indicate that reduced circulating CLU might reflect poor outcomes of BA patients and have potential as a novel biomarker for the disease severity following Kasai-operation."

The fundamental characteristics of CeO2-0.135 led to the highest surface area, surface area normalized reducibility and oxidized gold species (Aun+/Au0) on the surface, relatively higher oxygen vacancies and a smaller average gold particle size (7.9 nm). The activity results show that the Au/CeO2-0.135 has the highest methanol conversion and H2 production rate for oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM). The reducibility and gold particle size played a crucial role in determining the H2/CO2 ratio at the temperature of 200 °C."
"['Chemistry (all)', 'Materials Science (all)', 'Condensed Matter Physics']","Application of synthetic hureaulite as a new precursor for the synthesis of lithiophilite nanoparticles  2020 Elsevier Masson SASPlate-like hureaulite is successfully synthesized via a simple precipitation technique, and its vibrational and thermal behaviors are investigated. Its composition stabilizes at up to 165 °C and decomposes to Mn2P2O7 and Mn3(PO4)2 with different morphologies. Three thermal processes correspond to the first and second dehydrations, and polycondensation. However, the second dehydration shows two characteristics, and hence the deconvolution function is employed, which indicates two different water types in the crystal structure. Olivine-structured lithiophilite with nanosize is obtained from the thermal decomposition of the hureaulite precursor. The relationship between thermal and vibrational data is studied and the results are in agreement with each other. The factor-group analysis of hureaulite is also investigated by analyzing [PO3(HO)]2–, PO43−, and H2O. X-ray diffraction is applied for the sample structure determination. The obtained peaks and the corresponding lattice parameters are also found in agreement with the standard databases. The average crystallite sizes of synthesized compounds are determined by using the Scherrer equation, whereas the metal compositions are determined by using atomic spectrophotometers."

This study aims to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with primary sarcopenia in outpatient elderly. Additionally, we compared the severity of sarcopenia based on the 2014 and 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria. This cross-sectional study was performed in 330 subjects aged over 60 years in an outpatient setting. The muscle strength, muscle performance and muscle mass were assessed using the handheld dynamometer, 6-m gait speed, and bioelectrical impedance analysis, respectively. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 10% as per the 2014 and 2019 AWGS criteria. The development of sarcopenia was positively correlated with the age with an odds ratio (OR) of 6.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63–28.88] in the middle-old group (70–79 years), and 13.71 (95%CI 3.66–51.41; p = 0.009) in the very old group (≥ 80 years). Prefrailty and low physical activity were significantly associated with sarcopenia with an OR of 4.75 (95%CI 1.90—11.89) in prefrailty, 15.35 (95%CI 1.69–139.47) in the middle activity group, and 17.99 (95%CI 1.95–165.73) in the lowest activity group. In conclusion, primary sarcopenia was found in one-tenth of outpatient elderly. Age, prefrailty, and low activity were independent factors associated with sarcopenia."

The aims of this study were to determine the cyclodextrin (CD) solubilization of AS and characterize binary AS/CD and ternary AS/CD/polymer complexes in solution- and solid-state. Thermal stability of AS through heating process was determined and found that It could withstand by heating through sonication method. Phase-solubility profiles showed that β-cyclodextrin (βCD) exhibited the greatest solubilizing effect but sulfobutylether-βCD (SBEβCD) was selected for further investigations due to its relatively high complexation efficiency (CE) value. The effect of polymers that were poloxamer 407 (P407) and chitosan (CS) on CD solubilization were investigated. It was found that the increment of CE was resulted from the formation of ternary complexes or complex aggregates with confirmed by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) data indicated that the cyclohexane moiety of AS was totally inserted into the hydrophobic inner cavity of SBEβCD in the presence or absence of polymer. The molecular modeling study displayed the binding orientation of such complex which correlated to 1H NMR result. The solid state characterized by Fourier transform infra-red, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction demonstrated the formation of binary AS/SBEβCD and ternary AS/SBEβCD/polymer inclusion complexes. The enhancement of AS dissolution was achieved in both binary and ternary complexes. The permeation study showed that ternary AS/SBEβCD/CS nanoparticles exhibited a promising controlled drug release nanocarrier."
"['Clinical Psychology', 'Applied Psychology', 'Psychiatry and Mental Health']","Probability of major depression classification based on the SCID, CIDI, and MINI diagnostic interviews: A synthesis of three individual participant data meta-analyses  2020 Introduction: Three previous individual participant data meta-analyses (IPDMAs) reported that, compared to the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID), alternative reference standards, primarily the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), tended to misclassify major depression status, when controlling for depression symptom severity. However, there was an important lack of precision in the results. Objective: To compare the odds of the major depression classification based on the SCID, CIDI, and MINI. Methods: We included and standardized data from 3 IPDMA databases. For each IPDMA, separately, we fitted binomial generalized linear mixed models to compare the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of major depression classification, controlling for symptom severity and characteristics of participants, and the interaction between interview and symptom severity. Next, we synthesized results using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis. Results: In total, 69,405 participants (7,574 [11%] with major depression) from 212 studies were included. Controlling for symptom severity and participant characteristics, the MINI (74 studies; 25,749 participants) classified major depression more often than the SCID (108 studies; 21,953 participants; aOR 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.92]). Classification odds for the CIDI (30 studies; 21,703 participants) and the SCID did not differ overall (aOR 1.19; 95% CI 0.79-1.75); however, as screening scores increased, the aOR increased less for the CIDI than the SCID (interaction aOR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52-0.80). Conclusions: Compared to the SCID, the MINI classified major depression more often. The odds of the depression classification with the CIDI increased less as symptom levels increased. Interpretation of research that uses diagnostic interviews to classify depression should consider the interview characteristics."

As variation within pharmacogenes is population-specific, this study investigated the spectrum of 25 clinically relevant pharmacogenes in the Thai population (n = 291) from whole genome sequencing. The bioinformatics tool Stargazer was used for phenotype prediction, through assignment of alleles and detection of structural variation. Known and unreported potentially deleterious PGx variants were identified. Over 25% of Thais carried a high-risk diplotype in CYP3A5, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, NAT2, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. CYP2D6 structural variants accounted for 83.8% of all high-risk diplotypes. Of 39 known PGx variants identified, six variants associated with adverse drug reactions were common. Allele frequencies of CYP3A5*3 (rs776746), CYP2B6*6 (rs2279343), and NAT2 (rs1041983) were significantly higher in Thais than East-Asian and global populations. 121 unreported variants had potential to exert clinical impact, majority were rare and population-specific, with 60.3% of variants absent from gnomAD database. This study demonstrates the population-specific variation in clinically relevant pharmacogenes, the importance of CYP2D6 structural variation detection in the Thai population, and potential of unreported variants in explaining drug response. These findings are essential in development of dosing guidelines, PGx testing, clinical trials, and drugs."
['Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine'],"Precision renal replacement therapy Copyright  2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Purpose of review: This article reviews the current evidence supporting the use of precision medicine in the delivery of acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) to critically ill patients, focusing on timing, solute control, anticoagulation and technologic innovation. Recent findings: Precision medicine is most applicable to the timing of RRT in critically ill patients. As recent randomized controlled trials have failed to provide consensus on when to initiate acute RRT, the decision to start acute RRT should be based on individual patient clinical characteristics (e.g. severity of the disease, evolution of clinical parameters) and logistic considerations (e.g. organizational issues, availability of machines and disposables). The delivery of a dynamic dialytic dose is another application of precision medicine, as patients may require different and varying dialysis doses depending on individual patient factors and clinical course. Although regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is recommended as first-line anticoagulation for continuous RRT, modifications to RCA protocols and consideration of other anticoagulants should be individualized to the patient's clinical condition. Finally, the evolution of RRT technology has improved precision in dialysis delivery through increased machine accuracy, connectivity to the electronic medical record and automated reduction of downtime. Summary: RRT has become a complex treatment for critically ill patients, which allows for the prescription to be precisely tailored to the different clinical requirements."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Performance controlled via surface oxygen-vacancy in Ti-based oxide catalyst during methyl oleate epoxidation  2020, The Author(s).The catalytic performance with high conversion and high selectivity of Ti-based oxide catalysts have been widely investigated. Besides, stability, which is an essential parameter in the industrial process, lacked fundamental understanding. In this work, we combined computational and experimental techniques to provide insight into the deactivation of P25 and TS-1 Ti-based oxide catalysts during the methyl oleate (MO) epoxidation. The considered deactivation mechanisms are fouling and surface oxygen vacancy (OV). The fouling causes temporary catalyst deactivation through active site blockage but can be removed via calcination in air at high temperature. However, in this work, the OV formation plays an important role in the overall performance of the spent catalyst as the deactivated catalyst after regeneration, cannot be restored to the initial activity. Also, the effects of OV in spent catalysts caused (i) the formation of more Ti3+ species on the surface as evident by XPS and Bader charge analysis, (ii) the activity modification of the active region on the catalyst surface as the reduction in energy gap (Eg) occurred from the formation of the interstates observed in the density of states profiles of spent catalyst modeled by the O-vacant P25 and TS-1 models. This reduction in Eg affects directly the strength of Ti–OOH active site and MO bonding, in which high binding energy contributes to a low conversion because the MO needed an O atom from Ti–OOH site to form the methyl-9,10-epoxy stearate. Hence, the deactivation of the Ti-based oxide catalysts is caused not only by the insoluble by-products blocking the active region but also mainly from the OV. Note that the design of reactive and stable Ti-based oxide catalysts for MO epoxidation needed strategies to prevent OV formation that permanently deactivated the active region. Thus, the interrelation and magnitude between fouling and OV formation on catalyst deactivation will be investigated in future works."

All rights reserved.Background: Gigantol is a pharmacologically active bibenzyl compound exerting potential anticancer activities. At non-toxic concentrations, it reduces cancer stem cell properties and tumorigenicity. The mechanisms of the effects of gigantol on cancer cell growth are largely unknown. This study aimed to unravel the molecular profile and identify the prominent molecular mechanism of the effects of gigantol in controlling lung cancer cell proliferation. Materials and Methods: Proteomics and bioinformatics analysis were used accompanied by experimental molecular pharmacology approaches. Results: Gigantol exhibited antiproliferative effects on human lung cancer cells confirmed by 3-(4, 5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay and colony growth assay. The protein profile in response to gigantol treatment associated with regulation of cell proliferation was analyzed to determine the prominent protein targets. Among the significant hub proteins, MYC, an important proto-oncogene and proliferationpromoting transcription factor, was down-regulated with the highest number of protein-protein interactions. MYC downregulation was confirmed by western blot analysis. The upstream regulator of MYC, Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) was found to be responsible for MYC destabilization mediated by gigantol. Gigantol facilitated GSK3β function and resulted in the increase of MYC-ubiquitin complex as evaluated by immunoprecipitation. Conclusion: Gigantol was found to inhibit lung cancer proliferation through induction of GSK3β-mediated MYC ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. These data suggest gigantol to be a promising candidate for novel strategy in inhibition of lung cancer."

However, there are increasing global concerns over admixture, which can affect the quality, safety, and efficacy of herbal medicinal products. In this study, we aimed to use DNA metabarcoding to identify 39 Thai herbal products on the Thai National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) and assess species composition and admixture. Among the products, 24 samples were in-house-prepared formulations, and 15 samples were registered formulations. In our study, DNA metabarcoding analysis using ITS2 and rbcL barcode regions were employed to identify herbal ingredients mentioned in the products. The nuclear region, ITS2, was able to identify herbal ingredients in the products at the genus- and family-levels in 55% and 63% of cases, respectively. The chloroplast gene, rbcL, enabled genus- and family-level identifications in 58% and 73% of cases, respectively. In addition, plant species were detected in larger numbers (Family identified, absolute %) in registered herbal products than in in-house-prepared formulations. The level of fidelity increases concerns about the reliability of the products.

Based on its hydrostratigraphic characteristics, the aquifer in this area can be divided into an unconsolidated floodplain deposit aquifer (Qfd) and a volcanic aquifer (Vc). Study focus: This research investigated the hydrogeological characteristics and hydrogeochemical parameters of 42 groundwater samples obtained in the summer and rainy seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to identify the natural and anthropogenic impacts that likely influenced groundwater quality. New hydrological insights for the region: The groundwater type in Qfd and Vc is mainly Ca-Na-HCO3, suggesting that the hydrochemical groundwater of both aquifers is affected by the same sources. This study found evidence of ion exchange between Ca2+ and Na+ in both seasons. The five principal components had a cumulative variance greater than 76.11 and 77.88 % in the rainy and summer seasons, respectively. Based on correlation analysis and PCA, the sources of the groundwater chemistry are generally silicate and calcite weathering from geological formations, including alkali feldspar and Ca2+- and Mg2+- rich minerals. Moreover, some ions arose from anthropogenic activities, typically irrigation water and sewage wastewater. The presence of photphate (PO43-) may be related to the dissolution of apatite and associated with anthropogenic activities, causing an increase in PO43− in the rainy season."

Despite this, little is known regarding disease pathogenesis and immune responses to infection. The main objective of this study was to investigate the tissue distribution, histopathological changes, and immune response of fish exposed to TiLV. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) maintained at 25 ± 2 °C were challenged with TiLV via intragastric-gavage. At 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 days post-challenge (dpc), six fish per treatment were euthanized and subjected to complete necropsy. TiLV exposed fish presented 45% cumulative mortality at the end of the study. Gross lesions included cutaneous petechiae and ecchymoses, scale losses, skin ulcers, and exophthalmia. Mild multifocal hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis was observed as early as 3 dpc occasionally accompanied by syncytial formation, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, and inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes at subsequent time points. Necrosis of epithelial cells of the gastric glands and intestinal glands was also observed as early as 5 dpc. Intestinal samples showed reactive in situ hybridization signals as early as 1 dpc. No other lesions were observed in the brain or other organs. Histological changes were associated with viral dissemination and disease progression, as evidenced by increased TiLV detection in the intestine, gills, liver and spleen. Highest TiLV abundance was detected 7 dpc in gills, intestine, and liver showing an average of 6 LOG genome equivalent per ng of total RNA. Different transcript abundance was detected for the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β and interferon-induced myxovirus resistance protein gene in the mucosal sites (gills and intestine). Interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 transcript was more abundant in systemic organs (liver and spleen) while the expression in gills and intestine showed mixed expression at different time points. On the other hand, transforming growth factor β expression patterns differed amongst the tissues with a trend towards downregulation of the gene in liver and gills, and a trend towards upregulation in the spleen and intestine. Overall, these results demonstrate the intestinal routes as a main port of entry for TiLV, which subsequently spreads systematically throughout the fish body."

Advanced Healthcare Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbHThe interest in bioprinting of sustainable biomaterials is rapidly growing, and lignocellulosic biomaterials have a unique role in this development. Lignocellulosic materials are biocompatible and possess tunable mechanical properties, and therefore promising for use in the field of 3D-printed biomaterials. This review aims to spotlight the recent progress on the application of different lignocellulosic materials (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) from various sources (wood, bacteria, and fungi) in different forms (including nanocrystals and nanofibers in 3D bioprinting). Their crystallinity, leading to water insolubility and the presence of suspended nanostructures, makes these polymers stand out among hydrogel-forming biomaterials. These unique structures give rise to favorable properties such as high ink viscosity and strength and toughness of the final hydrogel, even when used at low concentrations. In this review, the application of lignocellulosic polymers with other components in inks is reported for 3D bioprinting and identified supercritical CO2 as a potential sterilization method for 3D-printed cellulosic materials. This review also focuses on the areas of potential development by highlighting the opportunities and unmet challenges such as the need for standardization of the production, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of the cellulosic materials that underscore the direction of future research into the 3D biofabrication of cellulose-based biomaterials."

"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health', 'Surgery']","A novel model of injured liver ductal organoids to investigate cholangiocyte apoptosis with relevance to biliary atresia  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: The fibrogenic process in cholangiopathic diseases such as biliary atresia (BA) involves bile duct injury and apoptosis of cholangiocytes, which leads to the progression of liver fibrosis into liver cirrhosis and can result in end-staged liver disease. Recent advances in the development of organoids or mini-organ structures have allowed us to create an ex vivo injury model of the bile duct that mimics bile duct injury in BA. The aim of this experimental study was to develop a novel model of injured intrahepatic cholangiocytes as this can be relevant to BA. Our new model is important for studying the pathophysiological response of bile ducts to injury and the role of cholangiocytes in initiating the fibrogenic cascade. In addition, it has the potential to be used as a tool for developing new treatment strategies for BA. Methods: Liver ductal organoids were generated from the liver of healthy neonatal mouse pups. Intrahepatic bile duct fragments were isolated and cultured in Matrigel dome. Injury was induced in the organoids by administration of acetaminophen in culture medium. The organoids were then evaluated for fibrogenic cytokines expression, cell apoptosis marker and cell proliferation marker. Results: Organoids generated from intrahepatic bile duct fragments organized themselves into single-layer epithelial spheroids with lumen on the inside mimicking in vivo bile ducts. After 24-h exposure to acetaminophen, cholangiocytes in the organoids responded to the injury by increasing expression of fibrogenic cytokines, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). This fibrogenic response of injured organoids was associated with increased cholangiocyte apoptosis and decreased cholangiocyte proliferation. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first description of cholangiocyte injury in the organoids derived from intrahepatic bile ducts. Our injury model demonstrated that cholangiocyte apoptosis and its fibrogenic response may play a role in initiation of the fibrogenic process in cholangiopathic diseases such as BA. These findings are important for the development of novel therapy to reduce cholangiocyte apoptosis and to halt the early fibrogenic cascade in liver fibrogenesis. This novel injury model can prove very valuable for future research in biliary atresia."

Finding a source of carcinogens is one of the important measures for preventing the cancer risk for this region. Specific sites at Pa Miang, Doi Saket have the highest incidences of lung cancer and have a combination of factors that influence indoor radon concentration. Our study identified the sources of indoor radon within several houses. The results indicate that geological and topographic characteristics, including active faults and mountain terraces, are the main sources of indoor radon, especially for wooden houses. Besides building materials, the design of the houses, ventilation conditions, and lifestyle choices are all factors influencing indoor radon concentrations and its associated risk. Although radon levels (29–101 Bq m−3) and total indoor annual effective doses (0.9–3.8 mSv year−1) received from all sources at these sites have shown no significant health risk due to radon exposure , this investigation will be useful as a starting point to guide strategies to respond and prevent the risk of lung cancer, especially in Chiang Mai."

The samples were examined for antibodies against influenza viruses by using NP-ELISA and specific antibodies against AIV-H5N1 (Clade 2.3.4) and AIV-H9N2 (Clade 9.4.2) by using Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay. The result of NP-ELISA assay showed that 12.88 % (80/621) of poultry in LBM was positive for AIV antibodies. In detail, 38.06 % (51/134) of layers, 7.08 % (8/113) of backyard chicken, 2.07 % (5/242) of broilers and 12.12 % (16/132) of ducks were AIV positive. The HI test for specific antibodies against AIV-H5N1 and AIV-H9N2 were 1.77 % (11/621) and 4.51 % (28/621), respectively. Our findings revealed the evidence of AIV-H5N1 and AIV-H9N2 exposure in both chicken and ducks in the LBM in Yangon, Myanmar. Risks of influenza infections and transmission among poultry and humans in the LBMs could not be ignored."

The prototype differs from the already existing indirect cooling systems by using a modified cutting insert that allows a larger volume of cryogenic fluid to flow under the cutting zone. For designing the prototype analytical and finite element, thermal calculations were performed; this enabled to optimize the heat evacuation of the tool from the rake face without altering the stress distribution on the insert when cutting material. Turning experiments on ASTM F-1537 CoCr alloys were performed under different cutting conditions and employing indirect cryogenic cooling and dry machining, to test the performance of the developed system. The results showed that the new system improved surface roughness by 12%, and cutting forces were also reduced by 12% when compared with the existing indirect cryogenic cooling technique."
['Materials Science (miscellaneous)'],"Properties and performance of the basalt-fiber reinforced texture roof tiles  2020 The AuthorsThe mechanical and the physical properties, and the performance of texture roof tiles reinforced with the basalt fibers were observed. The samples of the basalt-fiber reinforced texture roof tiles were produced on the industrial scale by using filter pressing method. After forming, the as-molded samples were air cured and characterized based on ASTM C1185 standard for their mechanical properties and physical properties. In addition, the roof-tile installation test was also performed. The results showed that the samples of the basalt-fiber reinforced texture roof tile (BFRT) could be produced on the industrial scale by using the common setting of the forming machine without further adjustment. For the appearance, the samples of BFRT had the appearance alike the common texture-roof tile products. In addition, BFRTs could be cut and drilled by using the standard cutting machine and could be installed by using the standard procedure for texture roof tile installation. For the properties, BFRTs had the properties as required by the industry requirements including the modulus of rupture (MOR) greater than 5 MPa, the modulus of elasticity (MOE) greater than 7000 MPa, the impact resistance greater than 1000 J/m2, and the density between 1.5−2.2 g/cm3."

Rice (Oryza sativa L.: SRNC05053-6-2) consists of anthocyanin, which exhibits strong antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the role of this black-coloured rice crude extract in alleviating the symptoms of psoriasis using human psoriatic artificial skin and an imiquimod-induced rat psoriasis model. Psoriasis-related genes, cytokines and chemokines were examined; in addition, the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and the immunohistopathological features of this condition were studied. The results showed that the rice extract reduced the severity of psoriasis by (1) decreasing the epidermal thickness, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, epidermal inflammation and degree of apoptosis induction via caspase-3, (2) increasing the expression levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β), (3) reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-20, IL-22 and TNF-α), chemokines (CCL-20) and anti-microbial peptides (psoriasin and β-defensin), (4) enhancing the antioxidative property (Nrf-2), (5) downregulating the levels of psoriasis-associated genes (psoriasin, β-defensin, koebnerisin 15L and koebnerisin 15S) and (6) upregulating the levels of psoriasis-improving genes (caspase-14, involucrin and filaggrin). Thus, the extract appears to exert therapeutic effects on psoriasis through its antioxidative and immunomodulatory properties."

The rapid spread of COVID-19 necessitates the development of cost-effective technology platforms for the production of vaccines, drugs, and protein reagents for appropriate disease diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explored the possibility of producing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and an anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibody (mAb) CR3022 in Nicotiana benthamiana. Both RBD and mAb CR3022 were transiently produced with the highest expression level of 8 μg/g and 130 μg/g leaf fresh weight respectively at 3 days post-infiltration. The plant-produced RBD exhibited specific binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, the plant-produced mAb CR3022 binds to SARS-CoV-2, but fails to neutralize the virus in vitro. This is the first report showing the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and mAb CR3022 in plants. Overall these findings provide a proof-of-concept for using plants as an expression system for the production of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and antibodies or similar other diagnostic reagents against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly, especially during epidemic or pandemic situation."

Main text: Key molecular players involved in the regulation of endothelial cell function are described, including PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, VEGFRs, SFK, Rho GEF TRIO, RAC-1, ITAM, SHP-2, MAPK/ERK, STAT-3, NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, eNOS, nitric oxide, miRNAs, KLF-4 and KLF-2. The key roles of platelet activation, xanthene oxidase and myeloperoxidase in the genesis of endothelial cell dysfunction and activation are detailed. The following roles of circulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the development of endothelial cell dysfunction are then described: paracrine signalling by circulating hydrogen peroxide, inhibition of eNOS and increased levels of mitochondrial ROS, including compromised mitochondrial dynamics, loss of calcium ion homeostasis and inactivation of SIRT-1-mediated signalling pathways. Next, loss of cellular redox homeostasis is considered, including further aspects of the roles of hydrogen peroxide signalling, the pathological consequences of elevated NF-κB, compromised S-nitrosylation and the development of hypernitrosylation and increased transcription of atherogenic miRNAs. These molecular aspects are then applied to neuroprogressive disorders by considering the following potential generators of endothelial dysfunction and activation in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia: NF-κB; platelet activation; atherogenic miRs; myeloperoxidase; xanthene oxidase and uric acid; and inflammation, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions: Finally, on the basis of the above molecular mechanisms, details are given of potential treatment options for mitigating endothelial cell dysfunction and activation in neuroprogressive disorders."

This study was conducted to evaluate PG600 effects on follicles, estrus, ovulation and estrogen production. Prepubertal gilts (n = 50) were treated with PG600. Gilts were evaluated for estrus while daily boar exposure was occurring. A sub-population of gilts (n = 12) were slaughtered on Day 3 to assess cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19) immunohistochemical staining in ovarian antral follicles. Ovaries of the remaining gilts (n = 38) were evaluated on Day 3 using ultrasonography and blood samples were collected for quantifying estradiol-17β. On Day 3 following administration of PG600, 94.0 % of gilts had large follicles, but only 76.3 % had expressed behavioral estrus by Day 6. Furthermore, 92.1 % of gilts had ovulations, with 16.6 corpora lutea/gilt. There was no association of number of large follicles on Day 0 or 3 with occurrence of estrus or ovulation (P > 0.05). Estradiol-17β concentrations on Day 3 did not differ (P > 0.05) in anestrus compared to estrual gilts and varied in gilts with large antral follicles. Immuno-detection of CYP19 on Day 3 was greater (P < 0.01) in large and medium compared to small follicles, (64.3 %, 34.2 % and 14.7 %, respectively). Results validate there is a dissociation of large follicle development with estrogen production on Day 3 in gonadotropin-treated gilts. These results indicate failure to express estrus may be due to follicle variation in estrogen production or response to estrogen feedback at the hypothalamus."
['Gastroenterology'],"Changes in hepatic fibrosis and vitamin D levels after viral hepatitis C eradication using direct-acting antiviral therapy  2020, The Author(s).Background: Vitamin D (VD) is important in hepatic fibrogenesis in animal models and human studies. VD deficiency is associated with liver fibrosis progression. Metabolic dysfunction of the liver, as an intermediate organ for VD metabolism, contributes partly to this deficiency. We hypothesized that improving hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients after eradication with direct-acting antivirals (DAA) would increase 25-hydroxyVD [25(OH)VD] levels. Methods: Eighty CHC patients (17 chronic hepatitis, and 63 cirrhosis) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics, hepatitis C viral load (VL), genotypes, liver enzymes and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) were assessed at baseline. Blood samples for 25(OH)VD and the procollagen type III N-terminal peptide (P3NP) were collected at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks. LSMs were re-evaluated at 48 weeks. Serum 25(OH)VD levels < 30 ng/mL were defined as VD insufficiency/deficiency. Paired t-tests were used for statistical analyses. Results: Among 80 patients, the mean age was 57.7 ± 10.5 years, and 52.5% were men. The mean VL was 6.1 ± 0.7 logIU/mL with genotype 1 predominance (55%). All patients achieved sustained virological response. The alanine aminotransferase levels decreased from 79.9 ± 53.3 U/L at baseline to 25.7 ± 17.2 and 22.3 ± 11.0 U/L at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean LSM decreased from 19.2 ± 15.3 to 11.7 ± 8.0 kPa at 48 weeks (p < 0.001). The P3NP levels decreased from 43.6 ± 22.0 ng/mL before treatment to 35.7 ± 21.1 and 29.4 ± 15.0 ng/mL at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). The proportions of VD insufficiency/deficiency were 72.5%, 91.3%, and 86.5% at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. The 25(OH)VD levels decreased from 26.3 ± 10.7 ng/mL at baseline to 20.8 ± 8.1 and 20.8 ± 8.5 ng/mL at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Curative treatment with DAA attenuated the liver stiffness and inflammation but did not improve VD levels. Over 80% of patients remained VD insufficient/deficient. Whether VD replacement during and after DAA therapy can improve hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.

Ni-based catalysts have been widely studied due to their low cost and relatively good catalytic performance. However, to reach high catalytic activity at low temperature and good stability at high temperature, the Ni-based catalysts should be improved. A special catalyst support was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis with in situ doping of Zr, namely, Zr(x)@MCM-41. A series of supported Ni-based catalysts, Ni/Zr(x)@MCM-41, was prepared by citric-acid-assisted impregnation. The structure and physicochemical properties of catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, TEM, CO2-TPD and TG. The strengthened interaction between Zr and Ni favoured the spillover of H absorbed on Ni to the support, which promoted the hydrogenation of CO2 and intermediates COad on the support and increased the CO2 conversion at low temperature. Simultaneously, with the addition of Zr, the amount of strong basic sites decreased, and the amount of surface oxygen species increased, which not only inhibited the carbon deposition but also enabled the deposited carbon to be reoxidized and participate in the reaction, so the selectivity of CH4 slightly improved. However, excessive addition of Zr will reduce the reactivity of the catalysts, since the order of the pore structure decreases, and many irregular pore structures are generated. The catalyst Ni/@Zr(0.01)@MCM-41 with an appropriate Zr content reached a high CO2 conversion of 88.6 % and a CH4 selectivity of 96.5 % at 280 °C and 1 MPa."

As its clinical and laboratory manifestations resemble many other metabolic disorders, HMGCS2D definite diagnosis presents a challenge, frequently requiring molecular tests. Only 26 patients with HMGCS2 mutations have been previously described, and this study reports the first two unrelated Thai patients, a 9-month-old male and an 8-month-old female, with HMGCS2D. During acute episodes, steatorrhea and dyslipidemia occurred, both previously unreported. Increased serum levels of triglycerides, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and low density lipoproteins (LDL), along with a decreased serum level of HDL were found. Both patients had hypophosphatemic encephalopathy, and the female had metabolic acidosis without hypoglycemia. Trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed that the male harbored two HMGCS2 mutations, a novel c.1480C>T (p.Arg494*) and a previously reported c.1502G>C (p.Arg501Pro), while the female was compound heterozygous for the c.1502G>C (p.Arg501Pro) and a previously reported mutation, c.520T>C (p.Phe174Leu). Interestingly, c.1502G>C (p.Arg501Pro) was not only found in both of our patients but also detected heterozygously in 9 out of 1081 unrelated individuals (allele frequency of 9/2162; 0.42%) in our in-house Thai exome database. Discovery of this common mutation suggests there could be about 14 babies with HMGCS2D within 800,000 newborns in Thailand annually. Therefore, awareness of HMGCS2D among medical personnel in Thailand should be raised."

COVID-19-associated AKI (COVID-19 AKI) is associated with high mortality and serves as an independent risk factor for all-cause in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. The pathophysiology and mechanisms of AKI in patients with COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated and seem to be multifactorial, in keeping with the pathophysiology of AKI in other patients who are critically ill. Little is known about the prevention and management of COVID-19 AKI. The emergence of regional ‘surges’ in COVID-19 cases can limit hospital resources, including dialysis availability and supplies; thus, careful daily assessment of available resources is needed. In this Consensus Statement, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative provides recommendations for the diagnosis, prevention and management of COVID-19 AKI based on current literature. We also make recommendations for areas of future research, which are aimed at improving understanding of the underlying processes and improving outcomes for patients with COVID-19 AKI."

This study extends the depth of study on small business entrepreneurs by examining the effect of knowledge acquisition, in particular financial knowledge that leads to the need for knowledge acquisition tools and technology. There is evidence to support that a lower level of existing financial knowledge in small business entrepreneurs encourages them to acquire more financial knowledge since they tend to be responsible for all tasks related to business survival. This finding is not consistent with several other previous studies. In addition, relevant knowledge on how to raise adequate capital to establish their business and the accurate calculation of cost are the two most important aspects of financial knowledge for encouraging small business entrepreneurs to seek effective knowledge acquisition tools and technology. The evidence provides insight for the government authorities supporting small businesses to provide financial knowledge to small business entrepreneurs during the pre-start-up phase and thereafter by providing the relevant knowledge on financing and cost calculation to strengthen and sustain these businesses. This will ultimately lead to an improvement in small business failure and increase the country’s economic growth."

Cells grown photoautotrophically under nitrogen-deprived conditions had high accumulation of PHB whose granules were clearly visualized using Nile-Red staining. A further increase of PHB was observed in cells grown photoheterotrophically for 3 days under nitrogen-deprived condition with 0.50%(w/v) acetate supplementation (−N +Act) showing the maximum PHB contents of 19.2 ± 0.5%(w/w DW). This was significantly higher than that in cells grown under the same condition but with either 0.1%(w/v) butyrate, or 0.75%(w/v) glucose, or 0.1%(w/v) propionate supplementation (P < 0.05). RT-PCR analysis revealed that photoheterotrophically grown cells under −N+ Act condition had a significant increase of phaB and phaC transcript levels (P < 0.05) compared with those supplemented with other organic carbons. The representative FTIR spectra of the extracted polymer from A. platensis showed prominent peaks at 1721 cm−1 and 1279 cm−1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretching of the ester group and asymmetric C–O–C stretching vibration, respectively. This spectral pattern is comparable with that of the standard PHB spectra, thus confirming the chemical nature of the extract. The overall results demonstrated that the enhanced PHB accumulation in A. platensis was attributed to the increased expression of phaB and phaC responsible for increased PHB biosynthesis when cells were grown photoheterotrophically in nitrogen-deprived medium containing organic carbon compounds."

We aimed to assess the relationship between perceived pain severity after operation and the amount of opioid medications prescribed at discharge in US vs non-US patients. Methods: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the International Patterns of Opioid Prescribing multicenter study. Patients 16 years and older who underwent appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or inguinal herniorrhaphy in 1 of 14 participating hospitals across 8 countries between October 2016 and March 2017 were included. In hospitals where pain severity was assessed using a 0 to 10 visual analog scale before hospital discharge, patients were stratified into the following groups, depending on the pain severity: none, mild (1 to 3), moderate (4 to 6), and severe (7 to 10). The number of opioid prescriptions, total number of pills, and oral morphine equivalents prescribed were calculated for each group and US and non-US patients were compared. Results: A total of 2,024 patients were included. Eighty-three percent of US patients without pain were prescribed opioids compared with 8.7% of non-US patients without pain (p < 0.001). The number of opioid prescriptions, number of pills, and oral morphine equivalents prescribed were similar across the 4 pain severity groups in US patients (p > 0.05). In contrast, the number of opioid prescriptions, number of opioid pills, and oral morphine equivalents prescribed among non-US patients were incrementally higher as the pain severity progressed from no pain to severe pain (all, p < 0.05). Conclusions: US patients are prescribed opioids at high rates and doses regardless of pain severity. Additional efforts should be directed toward tailoring opioid prescriptions to patients’ needs."

The dynamics of water quality, as well as plankton and microbial abundance, are collectively necessary for successful fish farming. The prospective use of jaggery as a potential carbon source and its influence on water quality, growth performance, innate immunity, serum bactericidal capacity, and disease resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila was investigated in Oreochromis niloticus. A completely randomized design was used in triplicates, where the control group was reared in a water system with no carbon source, while T1, T2, and T3 groups were raised in biofloc systems at C:N ratios of C:N12, C:N15, and C:N20, respectively. Water specimens were collected daily and fortnightly, while blood, serum, and head kidneys were collected at 75 days of experimental period for further analysis. TAN, nitrite, and ammonia values were considerably reduced, while the TSS values elevated significantly in all treated groups compared to the control. Jaggery-based biofloc system (JB-BFT) has a pronounced effect on hematological and growth performance parameters rather than control. Similarly, serum antioxidants, lysozyme, protease, antiprotease and bactericidal capacity were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. LYZ, TNF-α, and IL-1β genes were upregulated in proportion to C:N ratios with the highest fold in C:N20. Furthermore, fish treated with JB-BFT presented lower cumulative mortalities and better relative levels of production (RLP) after experimental challenge with A. hydrophila compared to control. In conclusion, JB-BFT has a robust influence on Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) innate immunity through favorable innovation of various immune-cells and enzymes as well as upregulating the expression levels of immune-related genes. This study offers jaggery as a new carbon source with unique properties that satisfy all considerations of biofloc technology in an eco-friendly manner."

Co-pyrolysis of RWS and OPT was performed at the mixing ratio of 50:50 (wt.). The biomass samples were pyrolyzed at temperatures of 400, 450, and 500 °C under specific conditions. The results indicated that the yields of the bio-oil, biochar and pyrolysis gas were in the ranges of 38.5-46.5, 22.27-28.68 and 30.1-36.9 wt.%, respectively. Pyrolysis of RWS at 500 °C provided the most bio-oil. Co-pyrolysis of RWS and OPT could improve the product yield and quality. The bio-oil had relatively high water content, while its pH was low. The main compounds of bio-oil were oxygenated compounds such as acetic acid, phenols and 2-Propanone, 1-hydroxy-, determined by GC-MS. The higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil ranged from 16.1 to 20.36 MJ/kg. The biochar had high carbon content and low oxygen content in proximate and ultimate analysis, and based on FTIR. The HHV of biochar was in the range from 26.35 to 29.6 MJ/kg. The biochar also was highly porous, which was revealed by SEM and BET. The pyrolysis gas mainly contained CO, CO2, H2 and CH4, and its heating value was in the range from 3.23 to 6.7 MJ/m3. Based on these results, the RWS and OPT are alternative and challenging biomasses for conversion to biofuels and value-added products via pyrolysis."

In their habitat range, monkeys have close contact with humans, allowing the possibility of bidirectional transmission of tuberculosis (TB) between the two species. Although the intradermal tuberculin skin test (TST) is used for TB detection in MF, it has limitations. Herein, we established the mIGRA, combining human QuantiFERON-TB Gold-Plus and monkey IFN-γ ELISApro systems, and used it to investigate 39 captive MF who were cage-mates or lived in cages located near a monkey who died from the naturally TB infection. During a 12-month period of study, 14 (36%), 10 (26%), and 8 (21%) monkeys showed TB-positive results using the mIGRA, the TST, and TB culture, respectively. Among the 14 mIGRA-positive monkeys, 8 (57.1%) were TST-positive and 7 (50%) were culture-positive, indicating early TB detection in the latent and active TB stages with the mIGRA. Interestingly, 3 (37.5%) of the TST-negative monkeys were culture-positive. Our study showed that the mIGRA offers many advantages, including high sensitivity and high throughput, and it requires only one on-site visit to the animals.

Although the noble metals are good candidates for such a process, the cost and scarcity limit their uses. The non-noble metals on the other hand, with satisfactory activity and cost, are of interest except their stability against the coke formation, the main deactivation scheme during the dry reforming reaction. Therefore, the study of the enhanced stability found in the bi-metallic system of Ni catalysts via the introduction of Co was carried out in this work. The activity and coke resistance were studied on both mono and bi-metallic system of the Ni-based catalysts (10%wt) supported on γ-Al2O3-HY zeolite prepared via the sol-gel method. The activity testing was performed in a fixed-bed reactor with a unity feed volume ratio under atmospheric pressure at 973 K, where the Ni–Co bi-metallic system exhibits higher activity than both mono-metallic of either pure Ni or Co due to a higher number of active sites confirmed by the CO chemisorption. On the stability testing, the high stability was found on the bi-metallic system as verified by the time-on-stream testing. In addition, the higher reduction temperature for the bi-metallic system via the analysis using H2-TPR also suggested stronger metal-support interaction which may decrease the bonding strength of the coke on the surface leading to lower deactivation."

This green technique does not require catalyst and is highly environmental-friendly. With 15% H2: 85% He mixed carrier gas concentration ratio and initial 31 °C (rising to 50 °C due to plasma), after 4 h of plasma hydrogenation, iodine value (IV) was reduced from 60.89 to 48.39 and detected trans-fat was 1.44%. This represents trans-fat generation rate of only 0.07% per % decrease in IV, which is about 6.12 times lower than a conventional method relying on high temperature, high pressure and catalyst. About 8 h was required to produce margarine with texture closest to commercial margarines. Acid value (AV) reduced from 0.47 to 0.27%, or 43% reduction, after 12–20 h of treatment, significantly indicating that plasma hydrogenation can also help extend shelf life of oil or margarine. Large portion of DBD plasma hydrogenated palm oil can, thus, be mixed with palm olein and interesterified palm oil to produce margarine with overall trans-fatty acid content no higher than regulatory requirement. Continuous production scheme was presented. This novel plasma hydrogenation technique offers promising possibility for commercial utilization by edible oils industry."

Main methods: We screened and compared the gene expression profiles obtained by RNA sequencing, of CCA cells cultured in high and normal glucose. Results from the transcriptomic analysis were confirmed in additional cell lines using in vitro migration-invasion assay, Western blotting and immunocytofluorescence. Key findings: Data indicated that high glucose increased the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), an upstream regulator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, through the nuclear localization of NF-κB. High glucose-induced NF-κB increased the migration and invasion of CCA cells and the expression of downstream NF-κB targeted genes associated with aggressiveness, including interleukin-6, a potent triggering signal of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Such effects were reversed by inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation which additionally reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705. Significance: These results indicate that NF-κB is activated by high glucose and they suggest that NF-κB interaction with STAT3 enhances CCA aggressiveness. Therefore, targeting multiple pathways such as STAT3 and NF-κB might improve CCA treatment outcome especially in condition such as hyperglycemia."

During polymerization, different cocatalysts were also used. It was found that Cat C with triethylaluminum as a cocatalyst exhibited the highest activity. This was likely attributed to optimal distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface. It can be observed by increased temperature in the reactor due to highly exothermic reaction during polymerization. By the way, the morphologies of the polymer obtained from this catalyst were spherical, which is more preferable. Besides the catalytic activity, crystallinity and morphology were also affected by the different magnesium sources used to prepare the catalysts."
"['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","Different water removal methods for facilitating biodiesel production from low-cost waste cooking oil containing high water content in hybridized reactive distillation  2020 Elsevier LtdWaste cooking oil (WCO) as feedstocks for biodiesel production contains high free fatty acid and water, causing negative impacts on the biodiesel yield and its purity. In this work, three alternative methods for handling water content in WCO feedstocks using the earlier hybridization of esterification and transesterification in a single reactive distillation column (hybridized RD) were investigated. Our simulation results revealed that using two heat exchangers combined with the hybridized RD is a simple method to remove water from WCO. However, it requires the highest energy as well as biodiesel production cost (1.63 USD/kg biodiesel). The extended spacing stage modification of the hybridized RD was proposed to remove water content. It requires a new hybridized RD construction by spacing stages addition which can handle WCO with 10 wt% of water content and require less energy, resulting in lower biodiesel production cost (1.07 USD/kg biodiesel). The integration of pervaporation unit was found to be the best option. It offers the highest performance in terms of water removal and methanol recovery, resulting in the lowest biodiesel production cost (1.04 USD/kg biodiesel). This study shows that using pervaporation or extended spacing stages with hybridized RD are promising methods for biodiesel production from WCO."

The dominant route of cell entry of the coronavirus is via phagocytosis, with ensconcement in endosomes thereafter proceeding via the endosomal pathway, involving transfer from early (EEs) to late endosomes (LEs) and ultimately into lysosomes via endolysosomal fusion. EE to LE transportation is a rate-limiting step for coronaviruses. Hence inhibition or dysregulation of endosomal trafficking could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the acidic luminal pH of the endolysosomal system is critical for the activity of numerous pH-sensitive hydrolytic enzymes. Golgi sub-compartments and Golgi-derived secretory vesicles also depend on being mildly acidic for optimal function and structure. Activation of endosomal toll-like receptors by viral RNA can upregulate inflammatory mediators and contribute to a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm, associated with a worsened clinical outcome in COVID-19. Such endosomal toll-like receptors could be inhibited by the use of pharmacological agents which increase endosomal pH, thereby reducing the activity of acid-dependent endosomal proteases required for their activity and/or assembly, leading to suppression of antigen-presenting cell activity, decreased autoantibody secretion, decreased nuclear factor-kappa B activity and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. It is also noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy, predisposing infected cells to apoptosis. It is therefore also suggested that further pharmacological inhibition of autophagy might encourage the apoptotic clearance of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells."

Several SARS-CoV-2 gene mutations have been reported. In the current study associations between SARS-CoV-2 gene variation and exposure history during the first wave of the outbreak in Thailand between January and May 2020 were investigated. Forty samples were collected at different time points during the outbreak, and parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence were used to assess genomic variation patterns. The phylogenetics of the 40 samples were clustered into L, GH, GR, O and T types. T types were predominant in Bangkok during the first local outbreak centered at a boxing stadium and entertainment venues in March 2020. Imported cases were infected with various types, including L, GH, GR and O. In southern Thailand introductions of different genotypes were identified at different times. No clinical parameters were significantly associated with differences in genotype. The results indicated local transmission (type T, Spike protein (A829T)) and imported cases (types L, GH, GR and O) during the first wave in Thailand. Genetic and epidemiological data may contribute to national policy formulation, transmission tracking and the implementation of measures to control viral spread."

However, users are becoming increasingly aware of the access these applications have to their personal information and the risk that applications may transmit Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to external servers, sometimes unknowingly to users. There is no easy way to know whether or not an application transmits PII. If this information could be made available to users as early as when they are browsing application markets looking for new applications to install on their devices, they can weigh the pros and cons to make an informed decision on the associated risk of their private information potentially being exposed. Previously, detection of PII transmission has been tackled using heavy-weight techniques such as static code analysis and dynamic behavior analysis requiring from several minutes to hours of testing and analysis per application. In constrast, we propose using light-weight methods to extract features that we then use to develop a classification model to detect PII transmission in under a minute with performance that rivals the heavy-weight techniques. We evaluate our model using an extensive set of more than 8700 top-ranked Android applications. Our approach is precise and fast, making it suitable for real-time detection and analysis of PII transmission in mobile applications."

This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of the probiotic combination Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 strains in chemotherapy-induced OM. Mice were divided into 4 groups. PBS/water and PBS/LR groups comprised of mice injected with PBS intraperitoneally (i.p.), and were given water or the mixture of L. reuteri (LR) DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 in water respectively. The 5-FU/water and 5-FU/LR groups comprised of mice injected with 5-FU i.p., and were given water or L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 in water respectively. Histopathological analysis revealed that the oral epithelia of the 5-FU/water and 5-FU/LR groups were thinner compared to PBS/water and PBS/LR groups. However, epithelial damage was significantly reduced in the 5-FU/LR compared to 5-FU/water group. Additionally, the 5-FU/LR group showed reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in the oral mucosa. We further showed that L. reuteri reduced oxidative stress through the nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) signalling. There was no evidence of translocation of L. reuteri systemically. This study demonstrated for the first time that L. reuteri protected oral mucosa against damage induced by chemotherapy."

Natural cellulose fibers are hydrophilic, resulting in lower reinforcement performance. Heat treatment can reduce water content in natural fibers and possibly improve the properties of natural FRP in terms of enhancing fiber and polymer composite action. This paper presents an improvement of jute fiber-reinforced polymer (JFRP) composites by heat treatment. The heat treatment conditions (i.e., temperature and duration) were considered. Coupons of heated JFRPs were tested to investigate their tensile properties. The application of JFRP on confinement was investigated by compression tests on concrete cylinders with JFRP wrapping. The experimental results indicated that a suitable heat treatment condition of 80°C for 24 h can significantly increase the tensile strength of JFRP coupons and the compressive strength of JFRP-confined concrete. The testing results of concrete confinement can be used to validate the existing predicting equations for confined compressive strength. In addition, a new equation was proposed for the effect of heat treatment of JFRP."

Since the problem is NP-hard with many conflicting objectives that need to be optimised simultaneously, multi-objective evolutionary optimisation is an effective technique to solve this problem. As a result, the hybridisation between MOEA/D and HBMO algorithms, namely MOEA/D-HBMO, is developed. The proposed algorithm is compared to MOEA/D and HBMO.

Recent evidence suggested that common genetic variations may underlie BrS in a complex inheritance model. Objective: The purpose of this study was to find common and rare/low-frequency genetic variants predisposing to BrS in persons in Thailand. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the association of common variants in 154 Thai BrS cases and 432 controls. We sequenced SCN5A in 131 cases and 205 controls. Variants were classified according to current guidelines, and case-control association testing was performed for rare and low-frequency variants. Results: Two loci were significantly associated with BrS. The first was near SCN5A/SCN10A (lead marker rs10428132; odds ratio [OR] 2.4; P = 3 × 10–10). Conditional analysis identified a novel independent signal in the same locus (rs6767797; OR 2.3; P = 2.7 × 10–10). The second locus was near HEY2 (lead marker rs3734634; OR 2.5; P = 7 × 10–9). Rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.0001) coding variants in SCN5A were found in 8 of the 131 cases (6.1% in cases vs 2.0% in controls; P = .046; OR 3.3; 95% confident interval [CI] 1.0–11.1), but an enrichment of low-frequency (MAF<0.001 and >0.0001) variants also was observed in cases, with 1 variant (SCN5A: p.Arg965Cys) detected in 4.6% of Thai BrS patients vs 0.5% in controls (P = 0.015; OR 9.8; 95% CI 1.2–82.3). Conclusion: The genetic basis of BrS in Thailand includes a wide spectrum of variant frequencies and effect sizes. As previously shown in European and Japanese populations, common variants near SCN5A and HEY2 are associated with BrS in the Thai population, confirming the transethnic transferability of these 2 major BrS loci."

A total of 285 fish (165 Oreochromisniloticus and 120 Clariasgariepinus) were collected randomly from private fish farms in Ismailia Governorate, Egypt. The collected specimens were examined bacteriologically. P. aeruginosa was isolated from 90 examined fish (31.57%), and the liver was the most prominent infected organ. The antibiogram of the isolated strains was determined using a disc diffusion method, where the tested strains exhibited multi-drug resistance (MDR) to amoxicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, and gentamicin. The PCR results revealed that all the examined strains harbored (oprL and toxA) virulence genes, while only 22.2% were positive for the phzM gene. On the contrary, none of the tested strains were positive for the exoS gene. Concerning the distribution of the antibiotic resistance genes, the examined strains harbored blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and tetA genes with a total prevalence of 83.3%, 77.7%, and 75.6%, respectively. Experimentally infected fish with P.aeruginosa displayed high mortalities in direct proportion to the encoded virulence genes and showed similar signs of septicemia found in the naturally infected one. In conclusion, P.aeruginosa is a major pathogen of O.niloticus and C.gariepinus.oprL and toxA genes are the most predominant virulence genes associated with P.aeruginosa infection. The blaCTX-M,blaTEM, and tetA genes are the main antibiotic-resistance genes that induce resistance patterns to cefotaxime, amoxicillin, and tetracycline, highlighting MDR P.aeruginosa strains of potential public health concern."

The ZnO nanoparticles were first synthesized by the sol–gel method. The NR-CNT/ZnO nanocomposites were prepared by latex mixing. Various proportions of ZnO in the CNT/ZnO hybrid filler were tested by mixing with NR to eventually form NR-CNT/ZnO nanocomposites. It was found that the optimum ZnO content in CNT/ZnO hybrid filler was about 3 phr. These ZnO contents provided the NR hybrid composite with superior mechanical properties in terms of tensile strength and modulus, together with good electrical conductivity and dielectric properties. In addition, stress relaxation tests revealed stronger filler network formation after incorporation of CNT-ZnO hybrid filler into the NR matrix. It might be due to electrostatic interactions between CNT and ZnO, also contributing to high electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of the NR-CNT/ZnO composites, when compared to a solely CNT filled NR composite. Furthermore, the Payne effect and morphological properties were qualitatively analyzed, indicating that CNT dispersion was finer in the NR-CNT/ZnO composites having about 1 to 3 phr ZnO content in CNT/ZnO. Higher contents of ZnO in CNT/ZnO hybrid filler caused large filler aggregates degrading mechanical and electrical properties."

Semen samples were collected from 39 men with asthenozoospermia, and their spermatozoa were isolated by two-layer Percoll density-gradient centrifugation. Kinetic parameters of the isolated spermatozoa (baseline before intervention) were determined immediately by computer-aided semen analysis. Total anti-oxidant capacity and protein carbonyl levels, as markers of oxidative stress, were also measured in the baseline spermatozoa. The baseline spermatozoa suspension was divided equally into two portions, one for CoQ10 supplementation (50 µg/ml for 1 hr) and the other as an un-supplemented vehicle control. The total motility of the CoQ10-supplemented spermatozoa was significantly higher than in the control (p =.009) and progressive motility tended to be higher (p =.053). Immotile sperm concentration in the CoQ10-supplemented spermatozoa was significantly lower than in both the baseline (p =.026) and control (p =.009). Total anti-oxidant capacity and protein carbonyl levels between the baseline, CoQ10-supplemented and control spermatozoa were not significantly different. Our data suggest that CoQ10 treatment reactivated sperm motility. We propose short-term supplementation of post-wash asthenozoospermic spermatozoa with CoQ10 before intrauterine insemination."

Methods 28 experts from 11 countries reviewed the evidence and modified the statements using the Delphi method, with consensus level predefined as ≥80% of agreement on each statement. The Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was followed. Results Consensus was reached in 26 statements. At an individual level, eradication of H. pylori reduces the risk of GC in asymptomatic subjects and is recommended unless there are competing considerations. In cohorts of vulnerable subjects (eg, first-degree relatives of patients with GC), a screen-and-treat strategy is also beneficial. H. pylori eradication in patients with early GC after curative endoscopic resection reduces the risk of metachronous cancer and calls for a re-examination on the hypothesis of a € the point of no return'. At the general population level, the strategy of screen-and-treat for H. pylori infection is most cost-effective in young adults in regions with a high incidence of GC and is recommended preferably before the development of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. However, such a strategy may still be effective in people aged over 50, and may be integrated or included into national healthcare priorities, such as colorectal cancer screening programmes, to optimise the resources. Reliable locally effective regimens based on the principles of antibiotic stewardship are recommended. Subjects at higher risk of GC, such as those with advanced gastric atrophy or intestinal metaplasia, should receive surveillance endoscopy after eradication of H. pylori. Conclusion Evidence supports the proposal that eradication therapy should be offered to all individuals infected with H. pylori. Vulnerable subjects should be tested, and treated if the test is positive. Mass screening and eradication of H. pylori should be considered in populations at higher risk of GC."

Genome editing enables specific and proficient modifications targeted at precise loci in an organism's genome. A major stride for genome editing is to generate a double stranded DNA break that is unique to a specific target gene. This is primarily accomplished by custom designed endonucleases, which either enable gene targeting through homologous recombination (HR) or allow site directed mutagenesis by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair mechanism. Genome editing tools have been deployed in various model and non-model plants for functional characterization of genes and improvement of agricultural traits. This comprises the generation of plants with compositional characteristics and traits that improve quality and productivity of crops as well as impart tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. During the last few decades, there has been a revolution in genome editing technologies with the advent of meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The implementation of these robust genome editing tools with respect to their adaptation, pliability and end use has provided a magic bullet in agricultural biology. This review focusses on these revolutionary methods in relevance to their application in crop improvement."

The use of low-dose oral minoxidil for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is receiving increasing attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral minoxidil for the treatment of male AGA. Methods: This was an open-label, prospective, single-arm study. Thirty men aged 24–59 years with AGA types III vertex to V were treated with oral minoxidil 5 mg once daily for 24 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated by hair counts, hair diameter measurements, photographic assessment, and self-administered questionnaire. The safety of the treatment was closely monitored by means of physical examinations and laboratory investigations. Results: There was a significant increase in total hair counts from baseline at weeks 12 (mean change + 26, range 182.5–208.5 hairs/cm2) and 24 (mean change + 35.1, range 182.5–217.6 hairs/cm2) (both p = 0.007). Photographic assessment of the vertex area by an expert panel revealed 100% improvement (score > + 1), with 43% of patients showing excellent improvement (score + 3, 71–100% increase). The frontal area also showed a significant response but less than that of the vertex area. Common side effects were hypertrichosis (93% of patients) and pedal edema (10%). No serious cardiovascular adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings were observed. Conclusion: Oral minoxidil 5 mg once daily effectively increased hair growth in our male patients with AGA and had a good safety profile in healthy subjects. However, oral minoxidil should be used carefully with men who have severe hypertension and increased risk for cardiovascular events."

In Taiwan, cellulosic waste has been used in anaerobic digestion for bioethanol production. This process produces a large amount of biomass-associated sludge that may become a serious environmental issue. Therefore, in this study, the anaerobic digestion sludge was recycled for the production of activated carbon via pyrolysis and activation by KOH. Surface characterization showed increased surface area and development of microporous structure upon activation. The FTIR image showed that high temperature activation eliminated most functional groups in the activated carbon, except for C[dbnd]O and C–O groups. The results showed that the activated carbon could be used for pollutant adsorbents such as molecular dyes (methylene blue: 217 mg g−1) and metal ions (copper: 169 mg g−1) from aqueous solution. In addition, the as-synthesized activated carbon can be used for CO2 capture and capacitor. Instead of focusing on one single application, we proposed that centralized production of activated carbon could be used in various applications, while further modification could be adopted depending on the need of its specific application."

Despite all of these differences, analyses of both structural and non-structural protein coding regions consistently suggested that the most recent common ancestor of FMDV could be dated back to the Middle Age, ~ 200 to 300 years earlier than previously thought. The ancestors of the Euro-Asiatic and SAT strains could be dated back to the mid-seventeenth century, and to the mid-fifteenth to mid-sixteenth century, respectively.

Purpose: To compare the accuracy of position and parallelism of two implants, using static and dynamic CAIS systems. Materials and methods: Thirty patients received two implants (60 implants) randomly allocated to two different CAIS systems. Optimal implant position and absolute parallelism was planned based on preoperative cone beam CT (CBCT). Patients received implants with a surgical guide (static CAIS, n = 30) or real-time navigation (dynamic CAIS, n = 30). Implant three-dimensional deviation and parallelism was calculated after surgery. Results: The mean 3D deviation in the static and dynamic CAIS group at implant platform were 1.04 ± 0.67 vs 1.24 ± 0.39 mm, at apex were 1.54 ± 0.79 vs 1.58 ± 0.56 mm and angulation were 4.08° ± 1.69° vs 3.78° ± 1.84°, respectively. The angle deviations between two placed implants (parallelism) in static and dynamic CAIS groups were 4.32° ± 2.44° and 3.55° ± 2.29°, respectively.

MEASUREMENTS: In a retrospective review of all POLSTs in participants' electronic health records, we describe the prevalence of POLSTs with conflicting orders for cardiac arrest and medical interventions, and use clustered logistic regression to evaluate potential predictors of conflicting orders. We also examine the prevalence of conflicts between POLST orders for antibiotics and artificial nutrition with orders for cardiac arrest or medical interventions. RESULTS: Among 3,924 complete POLSTs belonging to 3,123 decedents, 209 (5.3%) POLSTs contained orders to “attempt CPR” paired with orders for “limited interventions” or “comfort measures only”; 745/3169 (23.5%) POLSTs paired orders to restrict antibiotics with orders to deliver non-comfort-only care; and, 170/3098 (5.5%) POLSTs paired orders to withhold artificial nutrition with orders to deliver CPR or intensive care. Among POLSTs with orders to avoid intensive care, orders to attempt CPR were more likely to be present in POLSTs completed earlier in the patient's illness course (adjusted odds ratio = 1.27 per twofold increase in days from POLST to death; 95% confidence interval = 1.18–1.36; P <.001). CONCLUSION: Although most POLSTs are actionable by clinicians, 5% had conflicting orders for cardiac arrest and medical interventions, and 24% had one or more conflicts between orders for cardiac arrest, medical interventions, antibiotics, and artificial nutrition. These conflicting orders make implementation of POLST challenging for clinicians in acute care settings."
['Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine'],"Meropenem dosing recommendations for critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy  2020 Elsevier Inc.Purposes: To gather available meropenem pharmacokinetics and define drug dosing regimens for Asian critically ill patients receiving CRRT. Methods: All necessary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from Asian population were gathered to develop mathematic models with first order elimination. Meropenem concentration-time profiles were calculated to evaluate efficacy based on the probability of target attainment (PTA) of 40%fT>4MIC. A group of 5000 virtual patients was created and tested using Monte Carlo simulations for each dose in the models. The optimal dosing regimens were defined as the doses achieved at least 90% of the PTA. Results: The recommended meropenem dosing regimen for Asian critically ill patients receiving CRRT with standard (20–25 mL/kg/h) and high (35 mL/kg/h) effluent rates was 750 mg q 8 h to manage Gram negative infections with expected MIC < 2 mg/L in virtual Asian patients. Some meropenem dosages from available clinical resources could not achieve the aforementioned target. The volume of distribution, body weights and nonrenal clearance significantly contributed to drug dosing adaptation especially in the specific population. Conclusions: A meropenem regimen of 750 mg q 8 h was recommended for Asian critically ill patients receiving 2 different CRRT modalities with standard and high effluent rates. Clinical validation of these results is needed."

All rights reserved.Objective:The International Patterns of Opioid Prescribing study compares postoperative opioid prescribing patterns in the United States (US) versus the rest of the world.Summary of Background Data:The US is in the middle of an unprecedented opioid epidemic. Diversion of unused opioids contributes to the opioid epidemic.Methods:Patients ≥16 years old undergoing appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or inguinal hernia repair in 14 hospitals from 8 countries during a 6-month period were included. Medical records were systematically reviewed to identify: (1) preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics, (2) opioid intake within 3 months preoperatively, (3) opioid prescription upon discharge, and (4) opioid refills within 3 months postoperatively. The median/range and mean/standard deviation of number of pills and OME were compared between the US and non-US patients.Results:A total of 4690 patients were included. The mean age was 49 years, 47% were female, and 4% had opioid use history. Ninety-one percent of US patients were prescribed opioids, compared to 5% of non-US patients (P < 0.001). The median number of opioid pills and OME prescribed were 20 (0-135) and 150 (0-1680) mg for US versus 0 (0-50) and 0 (0-600) mg for non-US patients, respectively (both P < 0.001). The mean number of opioid pills and OME prescribed were 23.1 ± 13.9 in US and 183.5 ± 133.7 mg versus 0.8 ± 3.9 and 4.6 ± 27.7 mg in non-US patients, respectively (both P < 0.001). Opioid refill rates were 4.7% for US and 1.0% non-US patients (P < 0.001).Conclusions:US physicians prescribe alarmingly high amounts of opioid medications postoperatively. Further efforts should focus on limiting opioid prescribing and emphasize non-opioid alternatives in the US."

The qPCR showed an efficiency of 93.8%, a coefficient of correlation of 0.996 and a detection limit of 0.5 fg/reaction (0.005 parasites), although it detected until 0.25 fg/reaction (0.0025 parasites). When samples from 12 dogs experimentally infected with L. infantum were collected, L. infantum kDNA was detected at 16-weeks post-infection (wpi) in 41.7% and 91.7% of saliva and bone marrow samples, respectively, and at 47-wpi in 75% of both samples. L. infantum kDNA can be detected by qPCR in canine saliva, with lower sensitivity in the early stages of infection and a lower parasite load estimation compared to bone marrow. However, saliva had similar sensitivities to bone marrow in the later stages of the infection and could be used to detect L. infantum kDNA being aware of its limitations."

In cryo-EM, an incorporation of target proteins into nanodiscs is conducted under a rapid change from cryogenic to ambient temperatures. We present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) study for investigating an effect of temperature on the structural organization of DPPC-nanodisc and POPC-nanodisc. A non-monotonic response of physical quantities (i.e. the lipid order parameter, nanodisc flatness, structural change, solvation property, radius of gyration) with increase in temperature (T = 200–350 K) is found to be associated with the gel-ripple-liquid crystalline phase change within nanodiscs. The reorganization of lipids upon temperature variation induced conformational changes of MSP to minimize hydrophobic exposure of the lipid membrane to an aqueous environment. Structural response to temperature is different to a certain extent between the saturated DPPC and unsaturated POPC."

Modifications to the structure and properties of WPI films via heat-denaturation and plasticizers were determined. The structure-function relationship of the films was elucidated based on FTIR analysis. The developed water-soluble native WPI (NWPI) films had similar visual and barrier properties (oxygen permeability 4.74 × 10−4 to 12.26 × 10−4 cm3 μm/m2∙s∙kPa and water vapor permeability 0.0113–0.0148 g mm/m2∙s∙kPa) but lower mechanical properties (tensile strength 1.04–3.16 MPa, % elongation 7.45–15.31%, and elastic modulus 18.88–105.34 MPa) than the water-insoluble heat-denatured WPI films. The solution-sealed NWPI pouches of dry food models showed ready solubility. Heat denaturation strengthened the cohesion of the WPI films via the enhanced formation of the intermolecular β-sheet. Glycerol and atmospheric moisture showed plasticizing effects on both the barrier and tensile properties, which correlated well with the films’ moisture sorption isotherms. Solution-sealed NWPI pouches can be potentially used as leave-in packaging for portioned dry foods. The comprehensive understanding of the properties of glycerol-plasticized WPI films gained from this study is valuable in designing WPI-based packaging for commercial packaged food systems."

The total concentrations of 12 PAHs in the samples of terrestrial soils collected at 44 sites ranged from 1.83 to 32.9 ng g−1 with an average value of 10.8 ± 8.22 ng g−1. The concentrations of these PAHs were relatively lower compared with those found in other studies in other locations. The spatial distributions of PAHs showed the highest concentrations to be in areas adjacent to the Great Wall Station and the road network, and light molecular weight PAHs were predominant. Three- and four-ring PAHs were the most abundant, representing 48.3% and 27.1% of the total, respectively. Although the binary diagnostic ratios indicated petrogenic sources as the main PAH-emission sources, principal components analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis suggested that electricity generators (22.84%) and light-duty gasoline (18.94%) are the main sources in the soil of King George Island, Antarctica."

The early loss of primary teeth results in poor oral and general health in children. Objectives: To assess fracture resistance of severely damaged primary molars restored with intracoronal core with and without stainless steel crown (SSC). Materials and methods: Eighty extracted primary molars were divided into 4 groups: Group 1 MOD cavity; Group 2 MOLi cavity; Group 3 MODLi and Group 4 MODBLi. Pulpectomy and core build-up with and without SSC placement were carried out and subjected to fracture resistance testing to examine the load to fracture and type of fracture. Results: Fracture loads of 870–950 N were observed in the fabrication of intracoronal composite core in teeth with 1–2 remaining tooth walls whereas higher fracture load of teeth with extensive loss of all the surrounding wall following intracoronal composite core build-up was 1270 N. Following SSC placement, all groups had higher fracture load, with Group 4 being resisted to the highest force at 5500 N. Without SSC, Group 1 and Group 2 appeared to be restorable whereas Group 3 and Group 4 were non-restorable when fractured. Following SSC placement, all groups showed non-restorable fracture at the root furcation. Conclusions: Combined intracoronal core and SSC significantly strengthen the restored severely damaged primary molars with severe loss of coronal tooth structures. This proposed restoration method provided resistance to occlusal load that is much higher than the physiologic chewing force in children."

It is a small kiln for charcoal, biochar and wood vinegar production. It consists of a 200 l oil drum covered with fiberglass and galvanized steel as an insulator. The heat distribution pipe with slots is installed in the middle part of the kiln. There are four exhaust chimneys for smoke ventilation and wood vinegar collection. The chimneys are covered with condensers for wood vinegar condensation. Two types of biomass for this experiment were tamarind wood and corncob. For tamarind wood, the drum kiln loaded about 40 kg of wood with moisture content of 20–24% using 10–19 kg of firewood. It took about 3.5–5 h to reach maximum temperature (300-430 °C), and cooled down within 3–5 h. In sum, therefore, it took about 8 h for the complete tamarind wood charcoal process. The products were 11–12 kg of tamarind wood charcoal and 12–13 kg of wood vinegar. There was no incompletely carbonized wood and ash. Properties of tamarind wood charcoal were tested following ASTM D7582–15 and ASTM D5865–10. Tamarind wood charcoal showed 5% moisture content, 20–21% volatile matters, 68.7–69.8% fixed carbon, 3.8–5.6% of ash and 30–31 MJ kg−1 heat value. The energy conversion efficiency of the drum kilns with heat distribution pipe was about 40–48%. For biochar production, the drum kiln contained about 20 kg of corncob with moisture content of 21–22%. The process used about 6 kg of firewood. It took about 2.5 h for heating up to 300 °C, and it cooled down within 2.5 h. The products consisted of 5 kg of corncob biochar and 9.4 kg of corncob vinegar. The SEM micrograph presented porous structure of the corncob biochar."

Recent studies suggest the potential of mosquito-associated microbiota as a source for new biocontrol agents or new insecticidal chemotypes. In this study, we identified a strain of Serratia marcescens that has larvicidal activity against Anopheles dirus, an important malaria vector in Southeast Asia. This bacterium secretes heat-labile larvicidal macromolecules when cultured under static condition at 25°C but not 37°C. Two major protein bands of approximately 55 kDa and 110 kDa were present in spent medium cultured at 25°C but not at 37°C. The Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses of these two protein bands identified several proteases and chitinases that were previously reported for insecticidal properties against agricultural insect pests. The treatment with protease and chitinase inhibitors led to a reduction in larvicidal activity, confirming that these two groups of enzymes are responsible for the macromolecule's toxicity. Taken together, our results suggest a potential use of these enzymes in the development of larvicidal agents against Anopheles mosquitoes."

H.Rob. is one of the most popular herbal smoking cessation aids currently used in Thailand, and its adulteration with Emilia sonchifolia (L.) DC. is often found in the herbal market. Therefore, the quality of the raw material must be considered. This work aimed to integrate macro- and microscopic, chemical and genetic authentication strategies to differentiate C. cinereum raw material from its adulterant. Different morphological features between C. cinereum and E. sonchifolia were simply recognized at the leaf base. For microscopic characteristics, trichome and pappus features were different between the two plants. HPTLC profiles showed a distinct band that could be used to unambiguously differentiate C. cinereum from E. sonchifolia. Four triterpenoid compounds, β-amyrin, taraxasterol, lupeol, and betulin, were identified from the distinct HPTLC band of C. cinereum. The use of core DNA barcode regions; rbcL, matK, ITS and psbA-trnH provided species-level resolution to differentiate the two plants. Taken together, the integration of macroscopic and microscopic characterization, phytochemical analysis by HPTLC and DNA barcoding distinguished C. cinereum from E. sonchifolia. The signatures of C. cinereum obtained here can help manufacturers to increase the quality control of C. cinereum raw material in commercialized smoking cessation products."

The H2SO4-hydrolysis of BCNCs yielded rod-like/needle-like BCNCs and negatively charged surfaces, resulting from the generated surface sulfate groups on the bacterial cellulose (BC), which may be competent for numerous applications. The non-solvent induced phase separating (NIPS) and subsequent film casting methods were used to prepare the BCNCs/PEBAX microporous membranes. The obtained films were characterized with regards to their structure in terms of the content of crystalline phases, as well as their ionic transport and performance at elevated temperatures. The presence of the BCNCs fillers resulted in a good thermal and dimensional stability up to 150 °C and correlated with no membrane shrinkage. For NIPS membranes, the formation of a rigid cellulosic network within the matrix was emphasized and attributed to the thermal stabilization at temperatures above the melting temperature. In addition, the wettability, ionic conductivity, and thermal stability were investigated in BCNCs/PEBAX membranes filled with different amounts of BCNCs. Thus, the BCNCs/PEBAX membranes derived via NIPS had a remarkably good ionic conductivity, within the range of 10−2–10−3 S/cm, with up to 56.8% porosity. Such porous membranes are considered as an important and interesting candidate for the replacement of the commercial polyolefin-based microporous separator in lithium-ion batteries due to their superior electrochemical performances and the observed reinforcement effect."

In this study, α-Ti materials with superior tensile strength and good ductility were fabricated via additive manufacturing (AM). To improve the mechanical properties, core-shell structured Ti-(N) powder was used to introduce nitrogen atoms into selective laser melting (SLM) fabricated Ti materials. The microstructural analysis of as-fabricated Ti materials revealed an α microstructure with various grain morphologies such as irregular/massive grains, equiaxed grains, and refined acicular martensite grains (α՛) when different energy densities (E) from 83 J/mm3 to 278 J/mm3 were applied. Furthermore, we observed that grain refinement occurred with increasing solute nitrogen atoms. The mechanical properties were evaluated based on interrelated aspects, including nitrogen content and energy density, by changing the scanning parameters. Our results showed that as the nitrogen content in the as-fabricated Ti materials increased, a significant improvement in tensile strength and hardness was observed. The yield strength (σys) and ultimate tensile strength (σUTS) increased up to 1072 MPa and 1126 MPa, respectively, when the nitrogen content was approximately 0.5 wt.%, which was approximately three times that of SLM-processed pure Ti (∼0.01 mass% N). The increment in yield strength was further discussed mainly in terms of solid solution strengthening using the Labusch model and grain refinement strengthening using the Hall-Petch equation. This calculation raises the ability to quickly predict the yield strength of Ti materials with nitrogen solid solution produced by selective laser melting."

Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in captivity live in close contact with humans in many Asian countries. In this study, we developed an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) for elephant TB detection using antigens from the MTB complex (MTBC) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) as stimulating antigens (PPD, ESAT6, CFP10) to elicit a cell-mediated immune response (CMIR). The developed assay was applied to an elephant herd of more than 60 animals in Thailand, and the results were compared with those obtained through serological detection. IGRA has sufficient sensitivity for detecting elephant interferon gamma (eIFNγ) from specific antigen-stimulated PBMCs. Among 60 animals tested, 20 samples (33.3%) showed negative results for both MTBC and NTM infection. Eighteen samples (30%) showed positive responses against PPD from M. bovis and/or ESAT6 and CFP10, indicating MTBC infection. In contrast, only 15.6% showed seropositivity in a commercial serological test kit for elephant TB. The discrepancies between serological and CMIR highlight that the two methods may detect different stages of elephant TB. Therefore, employing both tests may enable them to complement each other in correctly identifying elephants that have been exposed to MTBC."

Entrepreneurship is considered to be a combination of both art and science, used to create value when targeting customers; however, there appears to be a myth when it comes to the recipe required for success. It was discovered by The Office of Small and Medium Enterprise Promotion that less than 10% of Thai small and medium entrepreneurial businesses were successful, while the global rate of success is close to 5 times higher than that of Thailand. Therefore, a better understanding of key success factors is necessary going forward. Typically, an entrepreneur’s journey starts with entrepreneurial intention, opportunity recognition, business initiative creation, and resource assembly, if they are to start their venture successfully. Entrepreneurial intention is a prerequisite to entrepreneurial behavior, based on the theory of planned behavior. Subsequently, scholars are interested in the key factors which drive entrepreneurial intention. While innovativeness has been proven to be one of the critical factors within certain groups of the population, there is little empirical data on the causal relationship between innovativeness and entrepreneurial intention amongst undergraduate students. As such, this study has two main objectives: (1) to explore factors influencing innovativeness, attitudes towards entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial intentions of undergraduate students, and (2) to understand the causal relationship between innovativeness and entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate students. The population of the study is comprised of undergraduate students from public universities and 330 effective responses were received in the survey. Based on the findings from confirmatory analysis and multiple regression, the empirical data is consistent with the theoretical measurement model for both innovativeness and entrepreneurial intention and (2) innovativeness can effectively predict entrepreneurial intention among undergraduate students."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Phosphoproteomic analysis of dengue virus infected U937 cells and identification of pyruvate kinase M2 as a differentially phosphorylated phosphoprotein  2020, The Author(s).Dengue virus (DENV) is an arthropod-borne Flavivirus that can cause a range of symptomatic disease in humans. There are four dengue viruses (DENV 1 to 4) and infection with one DENV only provides transient protection against a heterotypic virus. Second infections are often more severe as the disease is potentiated by antibodies from the first infection through a process known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Phosphorylation is a major post-translational modification that can have marked effects on a number of processes. To date there has been little information on the phosphorylation changes induced by DENV infection. This study aimed to determine global phosphoproteome changes induced by DENV 2 in U937 cells infected under an ADE protocol. A 2-dimensional electrophoretic approach coupled with a phosphoprotein-specific dye and mass spectroscopic analysis identified 15 statistically significant differentially phosphorylated proteins upon DENV 2 infection. One protein identified as significantly differentially phosphorylated, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) was validated. Treatment with a PKM2 inhibitor modestly reduced levels of infection and viral output, but no change was seen in cellular viral protein levels, suggesting that PKM2 acts on exocytic virus release. While the effect of inhibition of PKM2 was relatively modest, the results highlight the need for a greater understanding of the role of phosphoproteins in DENV infection."

Understanding the decadal variations of summer precipitation is useful for water resource management planning for long-term periods. This study investigates decadal changes in summer precipitation in Thailand. An evident increase in summer precipitation was found after the mid-1990s, and the possible causes have been discussed. An analysis of precipitation from observational stations revealed a significant shift in 1994; an increase in summer precipitation can be observed over most of Thailand after 1994. Inspections of the atmospheric circulation revealed cyclonic anomalies over the Indochina Peninsula in the lower troposphere, facilitating enhanced moisture transport towards Thailand. Meanwhile, the anomalous local Hadley circulation over eastern Thailand demonstrated stronger ascending motion after 1994, facilitating enhanced precipitation. The abovementioned changes in the atmospheric circulation and summer precipitation are closely related to the decadal changes in the sea surface temperature over the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation."

The aim of this study was to determine the current trends in management of WPFCs and the outcome of such modalities in Asian population. In this retrospective analysis, all patients diagnosed with pancreatitis from 2013 to 2016 in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, were analyzed. Relevant clinical data of all patients with peripancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) was reviewed. Clinical success was defined as improvement in symptoms after drainage. Of the total 636 patients with pancreatitis, 72 (11.3%) had WPFCs, of which 55 (8.6%) and 17 (2.7%) had pancreatic pseudocyst (PP) and walled-off necrosis (WON), respectively. The commonest etiologies of WPFCs were alcohol (38.9%) and biliary stone (29.2%). Post-procedure and pancreatic tumor related pancreatitis was found in 8.3% and 6.9% patients, respectively. PP was more common in chronic (27.8%) than acute (5.5%) pancreatitis. Of the 72 patients with WPFCs, 31 (43.1%) had local complications. Supportive, endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical drainage were employed in 58.3%, 27.8%, 8.3%, and 5.6% with success rates being 100%, 100%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. Complications that developed after percutaneous drainage included bleeding at procedure site (n = 1), infection of PFC (n = 1), and pancreatic duct leakage (n = 1). Over the past few years, endoscopic drainage has become the most common route of drainage of WPFCs followed by percutaneous and surgical routes. The success rate of endoscopic route is better than percutaneous and comparable to surgical modality."

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were recorded. We enrolled 63 participants in the study. The total acne counts decreased significantly in all three groups (P < 0.05) as compared with baseline. Participants in the SPL50 group had a significantly higher success rate than those in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Serum potassium and creatinine levels showed no significant changes with treatment or between groups. A small number of participants in SPL25 and SPL50 reported mild and temporary TRAE, such as menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness and dizziness. The combination of SPL 50 mg/day and topical BP proved effective in improving moderate AFA in Thai women, with an acceptable side-effect profile. We propose this regimen as an option for treating moderate AFA."

Smartphone applications have been widely used as a modality of obesity treatment. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of tablet/smartphone-based (OBEST) application added to standard treatment of obesity. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 77 obese children aged 10–15 years old from hospital-based and school-based settings. Participants were randomly assigned either the OBEST group or standard care group. After two months of treatment, both groups were assessed for anthropometric measurements, psychosocial functioning, and healthy eating behaviors and physical activities questionnaires. Results: Mean body mass index (BMI) was reduced significantly by 0.56 kg/m2 from baseline to two-month follow-up in the OBEST group (P =.005). Peer relationship problem scores from SDQ were significantly different between two groups (P =.049). All healthy eating behaviors and physical activities were no significant differences between groups and within-group, except for milk consumption every day observed in within-group of the OBEST application (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Using the OBEST application added to standard treatment might improve the effectiveness of obesity treatment in Thai children and adolescents. Future studies should be investigated outcomes in the longer periods and examined the potential factors related to outcomes."

It is necessary to immediately investigate this due to the mutation of the viral genome and there being no current protective vaccines or therapeutic drugs. Molecular modelling and molecular docking based on in silico screening strategies were employed to determine the potential activities of seven HIV protease (HIV-PR) inhibitors, two flu drugs, and eight natural compounds. The computational approach was carried out to discover the structural modes with a high binding affinity for these drugs on the homology structure of the Wuhan coronavirus protease (SARS-CoV-2 PR). From the theoretical calculations, all the drugs and natural compounds demonstrated various favorable binding affinities. An interesting finding was that the natural compounds tested had a higher potential binding activity with the pocket sites of SARS-CoV-2 PR compared to the groups of HIV-PR inhibitors. The binding modes of each complex illustrated between the drugs and compounds interacted with the functional group of amino acids in the binding pocket via hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions using the molecular dynamics simulation technique. This result supports the idea that existing protease inhibitors and natural compounds could be used to treat the new coronavirus. This report sought to provide fundamental knowledge as preliminary experimental data to propose an existing nutraceutical material against viral infection. Collectively, it is suggested that molecular modelling and molecular docking are suitable tools to search and screen for new drugs and natural compounds that can be used as future treatments for viral diseases."

These issues are magnified when they are faced by lower-income countries, countries that experiences intense rainfalls, or countries that face both of these realities. In any of these cases, solutions for disaster management should be simple, economical and cost-effective. The application of vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizaniodes) has been widely promoted in tropical regions as a cost-effective and environmental-friendly solution for slope stabilisation and erosion control for many years. Despite its potential, vetiver grass utilisation has not been widely accepted by disadvantaged agricultural communities at landslide hazard areas. The failure to promote vetiver grass use in these areas is primarily caused by a lacking of a sustainable model for vetiver grass implementation in rural communities. The purpose of this ex-post facto research is to examine the good practical model in two communities that have successfully established vetiver grass utilisation for land and water conservation. Research findings revealed that there are two important key elements in the success of these two communities. First, creation of community potential in the forms of human resource and leadership enhanced the community's support in finding an appropriate solution to solve their own problems. Second, networking and assistance from government and non-government organisations in marketing campaign gave the communities the resources they needed to effectively implement vetiver grass use. Together, these two key elements form a sustainable model in which communities will receive the support they need in order to achieve sustainable short-term and long-term vetiver grass utilisation."

Compared with the original RP, ultrasound treated RP (URP) significantly changed the chemical composition. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results suggested that the conformation of RP was filiform, smooth and slim and a large number of spherical pectins were produced by ultrasonic modification. Both RP and URP exhibited the potential antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Moreover, RP and URP effectively attenuated the oxidative damage induced by H2O2 and reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in human hepatic L02 cells and URP showed higher activity than RP. These results suggested that the unripe fruit pomace of Rubus chingii Hu could be used as a potential resource to obtain the antioxidant pectin and the ultrasound-assisted modification could significantly change the physical structure of pectin and effectively improve its antioxidant activities."
"['Parasitology', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Infectious Diseases']","First molecular investigation of haemosporidian parasites in Thai bat species  2020 The AuthorsMalaria parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa (Order: Haemosporida) infect diverse vertebrates and invertebrate hosts. At least seven genera of haemosporidian parasites have been described to exclusively infect bats. Most of these parasites remain enigmatic with a poorly known host range. Here, we investigated 271 bats belonging to 21 species and seven families from six provinces of Thailand. Overall, 124 out of 271 bats (45.8%) were positive for haemosporidian parasites, while none had Plasmodium, based on microscopic examination of blood smears and PCR amplification. We obtained 19 distinct cytochrome b (cytb) nucleotide haplotypes of Hepatocystis from seven bat species (families: Craseonycteridae, Hipposideridae, Pteropodidae, and Rhinolophidae). Nycteria was found in four bat species (Craseonycteridae, Emballonuridae, Megadermatidae, and Pteropodidae) and Polychromophilus in two species (Emballonuridae, Vespertilionidae). Phylogenetic analysis inferred from cytb sequences placed Hepatocystis into 2 different clades. Most Hepatocystis infections were found in insectivorous bats and clustered together with a sequence from Hipposideros larvatus in Cambodia (in subclade 1a). A single sequence of Hepatocystis obtained from a frugivorous bat, Cynopterus brachyotis, was placed in the same clade with Hepatocystis from the same bat species previously reported in Malaysia (clade 2). Nycteria in these Thai bats were clearly separated from the African isolates previously reported in bats in the family Rhinolophidae. Polychromophilus murinus from Myotis siligorensis was placed in a distinct clade (clade 2) from Polychromophilus melanipherus isolated from Taphozous melanopogon (clade 1). These results confirmed that at least two distinct species of Polychromophilus are found in Thailand. Collectively, Hepatocystis presented no host specificity. Although Megaderma spasma seemed to be infected by only Nycteria, its respective parasite does not show specificity to only a single bat host. Polychromophilus murinus and P. melanipherus seem to infect a narrower host range or are somehow restricted to bats in the families Vespertilionidae and Emballonuridae, respectively."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Role of Al in Na-ZSM-5 zeolite structure on catalyst stability in butene cracking reaction  2020, The Author(s).The Na-ZSM-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio = 20, 35, and 50) were prepared by rapid crystallization method to investigate their performance in butene cracking reaction. The XRD, XRF, NH3-TPD, FT-IR, TPO, UV–Vis, and 1H, 27Al, 29Si MAS NMR techniques were used to identify the physical and chemical properties of Na-ZSM-5 catalysts. The silanol group (Si–OH) was the main acid site of Na-ZSM-5, and it was proposed to be the active site for the butene cracking reaction. The butene conversion and coke formation were associated with the abundance of silanol groups over the Na-ZSM-5 catalyst. The dealumination, resulting in the deformation of tetrahedral framework aluminum species was a key factor for Na-ZSM-5 catalyst deactivation, because of the Si–O–Al bond breaking and formation of Si–O–Si bond. The stability of the Si–O–Al bond was linked to the molar number of sodium since the Na atom interacts with the Si–O–Al bond to form Si–ONa–Al structure, which enhances the stability of the silanol group. Therefore, the Si–ONa–Al in zeolite framework was an essential structure to retain the catalyst stability during the reaction. The Na-ZSM-5 with the lowest SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio showed the best performance in this study resulting the highest propylene yield and catalyst stability."

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the allele and genotype frequencies and the relationship between CYP3A4/5, DPYD, UGT1A1, ABCB1, and ABCC2 genetic variations and irinotecan-induced toxicity in Thai colorectal cancer patients. One hundred and thirty-two patients were genotyped, and the effect of genetic variations on irinotecan-induced toxicity was assessed in 66 patients who received irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

DPYD*2A and DPYD c.1774C > T variants were not detected in our study population. The ABCC2 c.3972C > T was significantly associated with grade 1–4 neutropenia (P < 0.012) at the first cycle. Patients carrying both UGT1A1*28 and *6 were significantly associated with severe neutropenia at the first (P < 0.001) and second (P = 0.017) cycles. In addition, patients carrying UG1A1*28 and *6 had significantly lower absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir at first (P < 0.001) and second (P = 0.001) cycles. This finding suggests that UGT1A1*28, *6, and ABCC2 c.3972C > T might be an important predictor for irinotecan-induced severe neutropenia."

The reactor is applied to determine ozone disinfection kinetics of poliovirus and to study whether EMA-qPCR can assess the viral infectivity after ozone disinfection. Methods: Ozone disinfection of poliovirus was conducted in the developed CQF, and the disinfection kinetics were tested in the range of 0·7–5·0 s at ozone concentration of 0·08 and 0·25 mg l−1. Inactivation, damage on viral genome and damage on capsid integrity were determined by plaque assay, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and ethidium monoazide treatment coupled with RT-qPCR (EMA-qPCR), respectively. Results: By using CQF, 2·18 and 2·76 log10 reductions were observed at the reaction time of 0·7 s and ozone concentration of 0·08 and 0·25 mg l−1, respectively, followed by tailing. Ozone disinfection kinetics of poliovirus 1 were better fit by the efficiency factor Hom model than by the Chick-Watson model, or the modified Chick-Watson model. Kinetics observed were similar between RT-qPCR and EMA-qPCR assays at the reaction times of <2·0 s and ozone concentrations of 0·08 and 0·25 mg l−1. At reaction times > 5 s, viral concentration evaluated by EMA-qPCR was reduced in comparison to stable RT-qPCR results. Both assays still underestimated the virus inactivation. Conclusion: The simple developed reactor can be used to investigate viral ozone disinfection kinetics and to elucidate inactivation characteristics or mechanisms at very short exposure times. Significance and Impact of the Study: The developed CQF reactor is beneficial for better understanding of virus inactivation by ozone, and the reactor can be used to better elucidate disinfection kinetics and mechanisms for future research. This work constitutes an important contribution to the existing knowledge of the application and limitation of the EMA/PMA-qPCR to assess virus infectivity after ozone disinfection."

The present study investigated the participation of the Notch receptor, NOTCH2, in the Jagged1-induced osteogenic differentiation in hPDLs. NOTCH2 and NOTCH4 mRNA expression levels increased during hPDL osteogenic differentiation. However, the endogenous NOTCH2 expression levels were markedly higher compared with NOTCH4. NOTCH2 expression knockdown using shRNA in hPDLs did not dramatically alter their proliferation or osteogenic differentiation compared with the shRNA control. After seeding on Jagged1-immobilized surfaces and maintaining the hPDLs in osteogenic medium, HES1 and HEY1 mRNA levels were markedly reduced in the shNOTCH2-transduced cells compared with the shControl group. Further, shNOTCH2-transduced cells exhibited less alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity and in vitro mineralization than the shControl cells when exposed to Jagged1. MSX2 and COL1A1 mRNA expression after Jagged1 activation were reduced in shNOTCH2-transduced cells. Endogenous Notch signaling inhibition using a γ-secretase inhibitor (DAPT) attenuated mineralization in hPDLs. DAPT treatment significantly promoted TWIST1, but decreased ALP, mRNA expression, compared with the control. In conclusion, Notch signaling is involved in hPDL osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, NOTCH2 participates in the mechanism by which Jagged1 induced osteogenic differentiation in hPDLs."

Improvement of hydrodynamics conditions is one of the most effective methods for membrane fouling control. This paper assesses a rotating biological contactor (RBC) integrated with membrane (RBC-MI) filtration that potentially offers inherent membrane fouling control as well as enhances biological performance, in which the membrane is placed inside the RBC bioreactor. Results show that the RBC-MI system achieves 84% of COD, 96.7% ammonium, 74% total nitrogen, 89% total phosphorus, and 96% turbidity removals. The integration of membrane placed inside the bioreactor doubles the permeability as compared to the external placement. Higher hydraulic performance is achieved at the low membrane-to-disk gap and higher disk rotational speed. The energy analysis shows that the RBC-MI consumes only 0.18 kWhm−3 signifying its viability as promission option to the energy-intensive conventional treatment systems."

Soil samples were collected from five e-waste separating and five non-separating houses in each of two neighboring communities and from six reference houses located approximately 4 km away from the e-waste community. At each selected house, the surface (0–15-cm depth) and the subsurface (15–30-cm depths) soils were taken to be digested by a microwave digester and then analyzed for the heavy metal contents by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The As, Pb, and Cd levels in the e-waste separating sites ranged from < 0.012 to 1.380, 0.110 to 15.283, and < 0.014 to 0.284 mg/kg, respectively, which were not in excess of the Thai standard level for residential soil (As = 3.9, Pb = 400, and Cd = 37 mg/kg), while Cu ranged from 1.180 to 380.413 mg/kg and exceeded the intervention value (190 mg/kg) of contaminated soil at three sites from a total of ten sampling sites. The physical e-waste dismantling activity enhanced the As, Cd, and Cu contamination levels in the surface soils. Ecological risk assessment revealed that the risk posed by the heavy metals in soils was higher at the e-waste separating houses than those at the non-separating sites and was mainly attributed to the levels of Cu > As > Cd > Pb for the surface soils and Cd > Cu > As > Pb for the subsurface soil. The association of the heavy metal soil levels with e-waste activity showed that if the e-waste activities were continuously operated, the As and Cu levels in the surface soil were more likely to exceed those levels in the reference houses. A good procedure for e-waste dismantling is necessary to be developed and implemented to prevent soil contamination and other related environmental problems."

Proposed aetiologies include hypovolemia, hemodynamic disturbance and inflammation but also specific factors like direct viral invasion, microvascular thrombosis, and altered regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. To date, there are no confirmed specific therapies, and prevention and management of AKI should follow established guidelines. Novel therapies specifically targeting COVID-19 related pathologies are under investigation. The incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is variable, ranging from 0-37%. In a pandemic, RRT practice is likely to be determined by the number of patients, availability of machines, consumables and staff, clinical expertise, and acceptable alternatives. Close collaboration between critical care and renal services is essential. In this article, we describe the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI, outline current management and suggest strategies to provide RRT during a pandemic when resources may be scarce."

Himawari-8 is the first unit of the Japan Meteorological Agency’s third generation of geostationary satellites. After its starting operation in 2015, there are several websites that provide remotely sensed images in real time. However, it is hard to develop a real-time and full-resolution website, due to the large amount of data to be handled. Himawari-8 real-time web is only one website that provides full-resolution remotely sensed images in real time. To reduce network traffic and increase the access speed of it from other countries out of Japan, mirror websites of each country are needed. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective mirroring system for the Himawari-8 real-time web. A mirroring model is introduced to avoid the problem of big data processing in the mirror websites. We adopt a file copy tool based on high-performance and flexible protocol (HpFP) to transfer meteorological satellite data from the Himawari-8 real-time web to the mirror websites. Our first target is Thailand, one of the most disaster-prone countries in South-East Asia. The mirror website is set up at an institution in Thailand connected via collaborative international networks, e.g., Japan Gigabit Network (JGN) and Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN). The results show that the proposed mirroring system is able to overcome the big data issue by reducing the central processing unit (CPU) usage in the mirror website and transferring remotely sensed image files at high speed over international networks even under packet loss conditions. This suggests that our mirroring system has a potential for deployment in other Asian and Oceanian countries."

However, toxicities and drug resistance limit the use of cisplatin. This study was aimed to improve cisplatin delivery using a targeting strategy to reduce the toxicity. In the present study, combinations of poly lactic-co-glycolic acids (PLGA) and liposomes were used as carriers for cisplatin delivery. In addition, to target the nanoparticle towards tumor cells, the liposome was conjugated with Avastin®, an anti-VEGF antibody. Cisplatin was loaded into PLGA using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method and further encapsulated in an Avastin® conjugated liposome (define herein as L-PLGA-Cis-Avastin®). Their physicochemical properties, including particle size, ζ-potential, encapsulation efficiency and drug release profiles were characterized. In addition, a study of the efficiency of tumor targeted drug delivery was conducted with cervical tumor bearing mice via intravenous injection. The therapeutic effect was examined in a 3D spheroid of SiHa cell line and SiHa cells bearing mice. The L-PLGA-Cis-Avastin® prompted a significant effect on cell viability and triggered cytotoxicity of SiHa cells. A cell internalization study confirmed that the L-PLGA-Cis-Avastin® had greater binding specificity to SiHa cells than those of L-PLGA-Cis or free drug, resulting in enhanced cellular uptake. Tumor targeting specificity was finally confirmed in xenograft tumors. Taken together, this nanoparticle could serve as a promising specific targeted drug for cervical cancer treatment."

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground & Aims: The safe discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy remains challenging in chronic hepatitis B. We investigated the potential role of quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core-related antigen and hepatitis B virus RNA at the end of treatment in predicting off-therapy relapse. Methods: Patients who fulfilled the stopping criteria of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver guideline were enrolled. Virological relapse was defined as hepatitis B virus DNA level greater than 2000 IU/mL, and clinical relapse was defined as virological relapse plus alanine aminotransferase level of more than twice the upper limit of normal. Results: Ninety-two patients participated. The combination of end-of-treatment hepatitis B core-related antigen and hepatitis B virus RNA levels was most predictive of clinical relapse. Multivariate analysis revealed that end-of-treatment hepatitis B core-related antigen and hepatitis B virus RNA were independently associated with clinical relapse. During follow-up, no patients with undetectable hepatitis B core-related antigen (<3.0 log10 U/mL) and hepatitis B virusRNA (<2.0 log10 copies/mL) at end of treatment developed clinical relapse, in comparison with 22.9% and 62.5% patients with detectable levels of one or both biomarkers respectively. End-of-treatment quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen was linked to a likelihood of hepatitis B surface antigen clearance. Conclusions: The combined hepatitis B core-related antigen and hepatitis B virus RNA assays at end of treatment were highly predictive of subsequent clinical relapse. These novel biomarkers could potentially be used to identify patients who could safely discontinue nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy."

Demographic and clinical information was extracted from the dental records and analysed using descriptive analysis methods and independent samples t-test. Results: Among the patients (188 males, 127 females) included in this study, majority were from suburbs with relatively low socio-economic status and under 6 years of age (62.54%). 69.84% were placed as low priority on the waiting list (average waiting time 298.61 days), with 13.01% of patients re-presenting with dental emergencies during the waiting time. Caries was the major indication for DGA and extraction was the most common treatment in all age groups (<6-year group-40%, 6-12-year group-38% and >12-year group-36%). Stainless steel crown was the second common treatment in <6-year group (27%). On average, a child received dental treatment on approximately ten teeth and the average procedure time was 66.88 ± 23.54 min. Conclusion: Despite existing caries prevention programs, dental caries is the major indicator for DGA in the paediatric population. This study emphasises the importance of early preventive care particularly targeting higher-caries-risk children to minimise the need of DGA."

Natural rubber latex (NRL), abundantly found in South East Asia, and wood flour (WF) were added to recycled high-density polyethylene (reHDPE) forming a three-phase composite with the aim of improving the composite's mechanical resilience, where WF strengthens the composite. The composition of reHDPE was fixed at 80 wt. % and the two fillers were varied to observe the effects of fillers on the mechanical properties, specifically impact resistance. The addition of only 5 wt.% NRL (WF15 NRL5) raises the impact resistance up to 100 % with respect to the composite with only 20 wt.% wood flour. The composition with 5 wt.% WF and 15 wt.% NRL (WF5 NRL15) exhibited the highest impact resistance of 483 J/m and the best processing conditions due to the dispersion of NRL in the polymer matrix. The flexible properties were improved in the NRL-dominated composition. Additionally, higher NRL content increases the decomposition temperature, thus allowing tunable adjustments to the compositions for practical applications. Processing a three-phase reHDPE/WF/NRL composite showed favorable results towards low-cost products from recycled raw materials."

FT-IR spectroscopy was used to confirm of each reaction in the multistep synthesis, including the transesterification, epoxidation, and reaction with ethylene glycol, ultimately producing palm olein-based polyol (POBP) and POBP-containing polyurethane foam. The morphological properties of the prepared foams were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The foam cells were uniform in size and shape, and a coarse cell structure was observed. While the pristine polyurethane foam contained closed cells, the pore structure became more interconnected with the introduction of POBP. The thermal properties were studied by DSC and TGA. In the presence of POBP, the sample was found to be less thermally stable. Mechanical testing revealed that the tensile strength and Young’s modulus were decreased, while the elongation at break was increased, suggesting that POBP improved the flexibility of the polyurethane foam. This was in agreement with the observed microstructure. Introducing POBP into the polyurethane foam also decreased the water contact angle from 120° to 80°. However, the oil sorption properties were improved due to interconnected pores along the polyurethane foam structure. Its sorption properties for synthetic dyes (methyl orange and rhodamine B) were also evaluated, and superior sorption properties were found for methyl orange. In short, the polyurethane synthesized from POBP exhibited attractive properties as a sorbent material. The labels in figures (1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) are not readable.

['Multidisciplinary'],"Natural rubber as a renewable carbon source for mesoporous carbon/silica nanocomposites  2020, The Author(s).This study is the first report on the preparation of mesoporous carbon/silica (MCS) nanocomposites with tunable mesoporosity and hydrophobicity using natural rubber (NR) as a renewable and cheap carbon source. A series of mesoporous nanocomposites based on NR and hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) were prepared via an in situ sol–gel process and used as precursors; then, they were converted into MCS materials by controlled carbonization. The NR/HMS precursors exhibited a high dispersion of rubber phase incorporated into the mesostructured silica framework as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. An increase in the carbonization temperature up to 700 °C resulted in MCS nanocomposites with a well-ordered mesostructure and uniform framework-confined wormhole-like channels. The NR/HMS nanocomposites possessed high specific surface area (500–675 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (1.14–1.44 cm3 g−1). The carbon content of MCS (3.0–16.1 wt%) was increased with an increase in the H2SO4 concentration. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the high dispersion of graphene oxide-like carbonaceous moieties in MCS materials; the type and amount of oxygen-containing groups in obtained MCS materials were determined by H2SO4 concentration. The enhanced hydrophobicity of MCS nanocomposites was related to the carbon content and the depletion of surface silanol groups, as confirmed by the water sorption measurement. The study on the controlled release of diclofenac in simulated gastrointestinal environment suggests a potential application of MCS materials as drug carriers."

Effects of the PNiPAM loading level in the range of 0–40% by weight (wt%) on the chemical, mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of the CMC/PNiPAMx films (where x is the wt% of PNiPAM) were symmetrically investigated. The obtained CMC/PNiPAMx films showed a high compatibility between the polymers. The CMC/PNiPAM20 blend showed the greatest tensile strength and modulus at 37.9 MPa and 2.1 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the thermal degradation of CMC was retarded by the addition of PNiPAM. Scanning electron microscopy images of CMC/PNiPAM20 revealed a porous structure that likely supported Zn2+ movement in the SPEs containing zinc triflate, resulting in the high Zn2+ ion transference number (0.56) and ionic conductivity (1.68 × 10–4 S cm−1). Interestingly, the presence of PNiPAM in the CMC/PNiPAMx blends showed a greater stability during charge–discharge cyclic tests, indicating the ability of PNiPAM to suppress dendrite formation from causing a short circuit. The developed CMC/PNiPAM20 based SPE is a promising material for high ionic conductivity and stability in a Zn ion battery."

The addition of LDPE in PP improved the elongation at break and tear strength. The PP/LDPE blend at a 80:20 (w/w) ratio was selected for blending with PLA and MMT and the PP/LDPE/PLA/MMT composite showed an increased tensile modulus, while the elongation at break decreased, with increasing PLA and MMT contents. The morphological structure of the respective nanocomposites was examined using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses. For the barrier properties, the incorporation of PLA and MMT in PP/LDPE blend tended to dramatically decrease the oxygen permeability but slightly increase the water vapor permeability. Moreover, the PP/LDPE/PLA/MMT composite as a new effective film decreased the tomato loss weight during low temperature storage (15–20 °C) compared to the PP film."

A laboratory-scale hollow fiber aMBR was operated for 150 days, at inlet methanol concentrations varying between 2 and 30 g m−3 and at empty bed residence times (EBRT) of 30, 10 and 5 s. Under steady-state conditions, a maximum methanol removal efficiency (RE) of 98% was obtained at an EBRT of 30 s and a decrease in RE of methanol was observed at lower EBRTs. On increasing the inlet loading rate, some portion of gas-phase MeOH was stripped into the liquid phase due to its solubility in water. Under transient conditions, the MeOH removal efficiency dropped from an average value of 95%–90% after 5 h of 10-fold shock load and dropped from an average value of 95%–88% under 5-fold increase in shock load. During transient-state tests, the aMBR performed well under different upset loading conditions and a drop in RE of ∼ 5–10% was observed. However, the aMBR performance was restored within 1–2 days when pre-shock conditions were restored. The results from microbial structure analysis revealed a big shift of the dominant methanol degrader, from Candida boidinii strain TBRC 217 to Xanthobacter sp. and Fusicolla sp., respectively."

Here we utilize the extensive sediment archives of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) and its predecessors to construct maps of deep-sea sediment type across two critical but contrasting boundaries in the Paleogene, one characterised by an interval of extreme warmth (Paleocene/Eocene) and the other by global cooling (Eocene/Oligocene). Ocean sediment distribution shows significant divergence both between the latest Paleocene and Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), across the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT), and in comparison to modern sediment distributions. Carbonate sedimentation in the latest Paleocene extends to high southern latitudes. Disappearance of carbonate sediments at the PETM is well documented and can be attributed to dissolution caused by significant ocean acidification as a result of carbon-cycle perturbation. Biosiliceous sediments are rare and it is posited that the reduced biogenic silica deposition at the equator is commensurate with an overall lack of equatorial upwelling in the early Paleogene ocean. In the Southern Ocean, we attribute the low in biosiliceous burial, to the warm deep water temperatures which would have impacted biogenic silica preservation. In the late Eocene, our sediment depositional maps record a tongue of radiolarian ooze in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Enhanced biosiliceous deposits in the late Eocene equatorial Pacific and South Atlantic are due to increased productivity and the spin-up of the oceans. Our compilation documents the enhanced global carbonate sedimentation in the early Oligocene, confirming that the drop in the carbonate compensation depth was global."

Taxonomic characterization revealed strain CSR-4 was a member of the genus Microbispora. Whole-genome sequence analysis exhibited the highest average nucleotide identity (ANI) value (95.34%) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) value (74.7%) between strain CSR-4 and the closest relative M. hainanensis DSM 45428T, which was in line with the assignment to same species. In addition, a new diterpene compound, 2α-hydroxy-8(14), 15-pimaradien-17, 18-dioic acid, and nine known compounds were isolated from the ethyl acetate crude extract of fermentation broth. Interestingly, a new diterpene displayed the suppressive effect on the recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (rhAChE) enzymes (IC50 96.87 ± 2.31 μg/ml). In silico studies based on molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to predict a binding mode of the new compound into the binding pocket of the rhAChE enzyme and revealed that some amino acids in the peripheral anions site (PAS), anionic subsite, oxyanion site and catalytic active site (CAS) of the rhAChE have interacted with the compound. Therefore, our new compound could be proposed as a potential active human AChE inhibitor.

This study aimed at quantitatively evaluating the S. suis contaminations in pork and surrounding environment in pork production chains and its contributions to human illnesses. Pig-associated and environmental samples were collected from four pork supply chains in Bangkok, and cross-sectional pork samples were collected from traditional market and supermarkets in eight provinces in Thailand. All samples were enumerated for S. suis serotype 2 using standard plate count method, and bacterial species were confirmed by biochemical tests together with PCR assays and Quellung method. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was performed to evaluate the S. suis serotype 2 illness risk from consuming pork in Thailand. Among four pork supply chains, the mean S. suis prevalence of pig-associated, and environmental samples were 10.9% (54/496), and 5.21% (25/480), respectively. S. suis has the highest prevalence (56.3%) (9/16), and the highest concentration (5.6 log CFU/g) in palatine tonsils. S. suis was isolated from 0.93% (11/1180) of pork samples; none of them was serotype 2. The QMRA model revealed a mean daily probability of S. suis serotype 2 illness as 2.32 × 10−8, corresponding to 502 and 31 annual cases and deaths, respectively. Additionally, the illness risk from consuming raw pork was predicted at 5.47 × 10−6. In conclusion, even the probability of S. suis illnesses from consuming pork was considerably low; however, the illnesses could lead to serious health consequences among susceptible populations."

Of these, PvMSP3α, PvMSP3β and PvMSP3γ, are considered to be vaccine targets. Despite comprehensive analyses of PvMSP3α and PvMSP3β, little is known about structural and sequence diversity in PvMSP3γ. Analysis of 118 complete pvmsp3γ sequences from diverse endemic areas of Thailand and 9 reported sequences has shown 86 distinct haplotypes. Based on variation in insert domains, pvmsp3γ can be classified into 3 types, i.e. Belem, Salvador I and NR520. Imperfect nucleotide repeats were found in six regions of the gene; none encoded tandem amino acid repeats. Predicted coiled-coil heptad repeats were abundant in the protein and displayed variation in length and location. Interspersed phase shifts occurred in the heptad arrays that may have an impact on protein structure. Polymorphism in pvmsp3γ seems to be generated by intragenic recombination and driven by natural selection. Most P. vivax isolates in Thailand exhibit population structure, suggesting limited gene flow across endemic areas. Phylogenetic analysis has suggested that insert domains could have been subsequently acquired during the evolution of pvmsp3γ. Sequence and structural diversity of PvMSP3γ may complicate vaccine design due to alteration in predicted immunogenic epitopes among variants."

RSV circulation and prevalence differ among countries and climates. To better understand whether climate factors influence the seasonality of RSV in Thailand, we examined RSV data from children ≤ 5 years-old who presented with respiratory symptoms from January 2012–December 2018. From a total of 8,209 nasopharyngeal samples, 13.2% (1,082/8,209) was RSV-positive, of which 37.5% (406/1,082) were RSV-A and 36.4% (394/1,082) were RSV-B. The annual unimodal RSV activity from July–November overlaps with the rainy season. Association between meteorological data including monthly average temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed for central Thailand and the incidence of RSV over 7-years was analyzed using Spearman’s rank and partial correlation. Multivariate time-series analysis with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model showed that RSV activity correlated positively with rainfall (r = 0.41) and relative humidity (r = 0.25), but negatively with mean temperature (r = − 0.27). The best-fitting ARIMA (1,0,0)(2,1,0)12 model suggests that peak RSV activity lags the hottest month of the year by 4 months. Our results enable possible prediction of RSV activity based on the climate and could help to anticipate the yearly upsurge of RSV in this region."

Soil and plant samples were collected from the study area to identify the concentrations of As and Cd using aqua-regia or HNO3 digestion. According to the Vietnamese agricultural soil criteria, all soil samples were contaminated with As and Cd. The distribution of As concentration is related to the distance from the Nui Phao mine. The higher As concentrations were measured in the area close to the mine. However, the Cd distribution in the soil showed a different pattern from As. Enrichment factor and Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo) indicated that As in the soil is derived from the mining activities, while Cd could have other geogenic or anthropogenic sources. The ranges of As and Cd concentration in polished rice grains in the Nui Phao mine area exceeded the CODEX criteria (0.2 mg/kg), which indicated extreme contamination. The arsenic concentration between soil and plant samples was determined to be a positive correlation, while the Cd concentration showed a negative correlation, implying that As and Cd have different geochemical behavior based on their sources."

However, most of the studies have focused on formal institutions that have law-like regulations and procedures. Owing to the skewed attention, the role of informal institutions in shaping sustainability frameworks has remained largely unexplored. The present study suggests that an informal institution, particularly religion, can play a significant role in developing a locally driven sustainability framework. In particular, this study investigates Thai context where Buddhism has shaped people's mindset, moral principles and day-to-day economic activity. For the past few decades, Thailand has theorized its own unique sustainability framework—sufficiency economy philosophy—based on Buddhist worldview on interrelationships of economy, society, and environment. By shedding light on how religion is formalized as a sustainability framework, this research contributes to institutional approach to sustainability."

Thailand’s experience in assimilating rural populations outside of the state structure may provide some lessons-learned on assimilation techniques that benefit both the minority populations and nation–state. In the post-World War Two period leading up to, and through, the Second Indochina War (1959–1975), the Thai state embarked upon a nation-building effort to improve the kingdom’s security posture. Conflict was advancing on peninsular Southeast Asia, and Thai leaders reckoned a durable way to protect Thailand were to enhance its national security through two measures: improve the population’s quality of life through rural economic development and acculturate remote, rural villagers into the greater Thai Kingdom. This paper focuses on the latter, how the Royal Thai Government acculturated and assimilated villagers living in the outermost reaches of the kingdom, many of whom were only vaguely aware of the concepts of government and Thai nationhood. The Thai government accomplished this assimilation, through rural development, nationalism, and promotion of Buddhist values. Although lingering social and economic problems remain, they are a far cry from the rural separatist movement that once plagued Bangkok. Thailand successfully integrated the rural population culturally, socially, and linguistically, creating an enduring kingdom. This paper discusses how the Thai government conducted this effort and achieved its results."

Materials and methods: 3D proton density CUBE MRI of 6 cadaveric knees without significant osteoarthritis (OA) was acquired, 0.25-mm resolution. Menisci were evaluated and classified intact or torn. MR data were transferred to ImageJ program to segment tibial 3D volume of interest (VOI). Data was subdivided into meniscus-covered/meniscus-uncovered regions. Segmented VOI was classified into binary data, trabeculae/bone marrow. The trabecular bone data was used to measure MR biomarkers (apparent subchondral plate–connected bone density (adapted from spine MR), apparent trabecular bone volume fraction, apparent mean trabecular thickness, apparent connectivity density, and structure model index (SMI)). Mean value of parameters was analyzed for the effects of meniscal tear/tibial coverage. Results: Nine torn menisci and 3 intact menisci were present. MR measures of bone varied significantly due to meniscal coverage/tear. Subchondral plate–connected bone density under covered meniscus regions increased from 10.9 to 23.5% with meniscal tear. Values increased in uncovered regions, 19.3% (intact) and 32.4% (torn). This reflects higher density when uncovered (p = 0.048) with meniscal tear (p = 0.007). Similar patterns were found for trabecular bone fraction (coverage p < 0.001, tear p = 0.047), trabecular thickness (coverage p = 0.03), connectivity density (coverage p = 0.002), and SMI (coverage p = 0.015). Conclusion: Quantitative trabecular bone evaluation emphasizes intrinsic structural differences between meniscus-covered/meniscus-uncovered tibias. Results offer insight into bone adaptation with meniscal tear and support the hypothesis that subchondral bone plate–connected bone density could be important in early subchondral bone adaptation."

In addition to genes linked to autism, several genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were found to be differentially expressed, although the association between BPA-responsive genes and AD-related genes has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we demonstrated that in utero BPA exposure also disrupted the transcriptome profiles of genes associated with neuroinflammation and AD in the hippocampus. The level of NF-κB protein and its AD-related target gene Bace1 were significantly increased in the offspring hippocampus in a sex-dependent manner. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis also showed an increase in the expression of Tnf gene. Moreover, the reanalysis of transcriptome profiling data from several previously published BPA studies consistently showed that BPA-responsive genes were significantly associated with top AD candidate genes. The findings from this study suggest that maternal BPA exposure may increase AD risk in offspring by dysregulating genes associated with AD neuropathology and inflammation and reveal a possible relationship between AD and autism, which are linked to the same environmental factor. Sex-specific effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the susceptibility of AD deserve further investigation."

We have identified that simple ammonium salts bind to these receptors and are effective in vivo. Radioligand binding assays were used to obtain structure-activity relationships of these salts. MTS assays were performed to determine their effect on growth in MCF7 and MDA-MB-486 cells. Anticancer properties were tested in NMRI mice transplanted with a fragment of mouse adenocarcinoma (MAC13). Antidepressant activity was tested using the forced-swim test and tail suspension tests. Dipentylammonium (Ki 43 nM), tripentylammonium (Ki 15 nM) and trihexylammonium (Ki 9 nM) showed high affinity for the sigma-1 receptor. Dioctanoylammonium had the highest affinity (K50 0.05 nM); this also showed the highest affinity for sigma-2 receptors (Ki 13 nM). Dipentylammonium was found to have antidepressant activity in vivo. Branched-chain ammonium salts showed lower affinity. Bis(2-ethylhexyl)ammonium (K50 29 µM), triisopentylammonium (K50 196 µM) and dioctanoylammonium showed a low Hill slope, and fitted a 2-site binding model for the sigma-1 receptor. We propose this two-site binding can be used to biochemically define a sigma-1 receptor antagonist. Bis(2-ethylhexyl)ammonium and triisopentylammonium were able to inhibit the growth of tumours in vivo.

VPA is also an epigenetic modulator, inhibiting histone deacetylase, and it has been subjected to clinical study for cancer treatment. During the investigation of VPA on a metabolite profile in a fungus, we found that VPA has significant effects on the production of some fatty acids. Further exploration of VPA on fatty acid profiles of microorganisms, fungi, yeast, and bacteria, as well as representative gut microbiome, revealed that VPA could enhance or reduce the production of some fatty acids. VPA was found to induce the production of trans-9-elaidic acid, a fatty acid that was previously reported to have cellular effects in human macrophages. VPA could also inhibit the production of some polyketides produced by a model fungus. The present work suggests that the induction or inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis by VPA (100 µM) in gut microbiome could give effects to patients treated with VPA because high doses of VPA oral administration (up to 600 mg to 900 mg) are used by patients; the concentration of VPA in the human gut may reach a concentration of 100 µM, which may give effects to gut microorganisms."

It comprises three indicators, namely, the Gini index, the income share held by the top 10%, and the income share held by the bottom 10%. The data from the World Bank database and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Income Distribution Database between 2005 and 2015 are used to demonstrate how the inequality index works. The results show that it can distinguish income inequality among countries that share the same Gini index but have different income gaps between the top 10% and the bottom 10%. It could also distinguish income inequality among countries that have the same ratio of income share held by the top 10% to income share held by the bottom 10% but differ in the values of the Gini index. In addition, the inequality index could capture the dynamics where the Gini index of a country is stable over time but the ratio of income share of the top 10% to income share of the bottom 10% is increasing. Furthermore, the inequality index could be applied to other scientific disciplines as a measure of statistical heterogeneity and for size distributions of any non-negative quantities."

Resection of RHV was inevitable to get free margin. Fortunately, a significant IRHV was present, so we could preserve segment 6. Central bisectionectomy with segment 7 resection using the Glissonean pedicle approach, and hepatic vein guided transection was planned.3 Methods: After placement of trocars, pneumoperitoneum was created. The main surgical steps were: (1) Right anterior Glissonean pedicle control; (2) Parenchymal transection along the umbilical fissure; (3) Transection of the right anterior portal pedicle, middle, and right hepatic vein; (4) Parenchymal transection between segments 5 and 6; and (5) Identification of IRHV and resection of segment 7. Results: The operative time was 330 min, and estimated blood loss was 80 mL. The total intermittent inflow occlusion time was 90 min. The histopathologic diagnosis was well-differentiated HCC. The tumors size of segments 8 and 7 was 4 cm and 2.9 cm, respectively. The resection margin was negative. The patient was discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 5. Conclusions: The preserved liver parenchyma after hepatectomy demands good vascular inflow and outflow. A large IRHV could be adequate outflow of segment 6, allowing more distinct operations."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Urine Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL) for Prediction of Persistent AKI and Major Adverse Kidney Events  2020, The Author(s).We aimed to determine whether urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) can accurately predict persistent AKI, major adverse kidney events at 30 days (MAKE30) and 365 days (MAKE365) in hospitalized AKI patients. This is a retrospective study of adult patients who were admitted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. We performed multivariable logistic regression for persistent AKI, MAKE30, and MAKE365. We developed equations for predicting MAKE30 and MAKE365 and divided the dataset into derivation and validation cohorts. uNGAL performance and predictive models were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC). Among 1,322 patients with AKI, 76.9%, 45.1%, and 61.7% had persistent AKI, MAKE30, and MAKE365. The AROC were 0.75 (95% confidence interval[CI] 0.70–0.80), 0.66 (95%CI 0.61–0.71), and 0.64 (95%CI 0.59–0.70) for prediction of persistent AKI, MAKE30, and MAKE365 by uNGAL. The AROC in the validation dataset combining uNGAL with clinical covariates were 0.74 (95%CI 0.69–0.79) and 0.72 (95%CI 0.67–0.77) for MAKE30 and MAKE365. We demonstrated an association between uNGAL and persistent AKI, MAKE30, and MAKE365. Prediction models combining uNGAL can modestly predict MAKE30 and MAKE365. Therefore, uNGAL is a useful tool for improving AKI risk stratification."
['Orthopedics and Sports Medicine'],"Prevalence of asymptomatic radiographic vertebral fracture in postmenopausal Thai women  2020, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.Summary: We aim to investigate the nationwide prevalence of asymptomatic radiographic vertebral fracture in Thailand. We found 29% of postmenopausal women had at least one radiographic vertebral fracture. The prevalence was significantly higher among women with osteoporosis at the total hip (TH) region which implies that TH bone mineral density is a determinant of vertebral fracture risk. Introduction: Radiographic vertebral fracture is associated with an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture and mortality in postmenopausal women. We designed a study to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic vertebral fractures in postmenopausal Thai women. Methods: The study was designed as a cross-sectional investigation at five university hospitals so as to achieve representation of the four main regions of Thailand. Radiographs were taken from 1062 postmenopausal women averaging 60 years of age. The presence of vertebral fracture was assessed by the Genant’s semiquantitative method with three independent radiologists. Respective bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH). Results: Among the 1062 women, 311 were found to have at least one radiographic vertebral fracture—yielding a prevalence of 29% (95% CI 23.6–32.0%)—and 90 (8.5%, 95% CI 6.8–10.2%) had at least two fractures. The prevalence of vertebral fracture increased with advancing age. Most fractures occurred at one vertebra (71%) and only 29% at multiple vertebrae. The prevalence of vertebral fracture was significantly higher among women with osteoporosis compared with non-osteoporosis at the TH region. There was no significant difference in the prevalence among women with or without osteoporosis at the LS or FN. Conclusions: Radiographic vertebral fractures were common among Thai postmenopausal women (~ 29%). These findings suggest that approximately one in three postmenopausal women has undiagnosed vertebral fracture. Radiographic diagnosis should therefore be an essential investigation for identifying and confirming the presence of vertebral fractures."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Generation and characterization of HLA-universal platelets derived from induced pluripotent stem cells  2020, The Author(s).Platelet demand has increased around the world. However, the inadequacy of donors, the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections and associated reactions, and the refractory nature of platelet transfusions are among the limitations of allogeneic platelet transfusions. To alleviate these problems, we propose generating platelets in a laboratory that do not induce alloimmunity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, which is a major cause of immune reaction in platelet transfusion refractoriness. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a healthy Thai woman. We then knocked out the β2-microglobulin (β2m) gene in the cells using paired CRISPR/Cas9 nickases and sequentially differentiated the cells into haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), megakaryocytes (MKs) and platelets. Silencing of HLA class I expression was observed on the cell surface of β2m-knockout iPSCs, iPSC-derived HSCs, MKs and platelets. The HLA-universal iPSC-derived platelets were shown to be activated, and they aggregated after stimulation. In addition, our in vivo platelet survival experiments demonstrated that human platelets were detectable at 2 and 24 hours after injecting the β2m-KO MKs. In summary, we successfully generated functional iPSC-derived platelets in vitro without HLA class I expression by knocking out the β2m gene using paired CRISPR/Cas9 nickases."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Clinical validation of urinary indole-reacted calcium oxalate crystallization index (iCOCI) test for diagnosing calcium oxalate urolithiasis  2020, The Author(s).An indole-reacted calcium oxalate crystallization index (iCOCI) test was developed to quantify the total competence of urine to precipitate calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals. We conducted the prospective cohort study in accordance with the STARD guideline to evaluate the accuracy of urinary iCOCI test (index test) for diagnosing urolithiasis. A total of 281 participants were recruited for the study. Levels of urinary iCOCI were determined in the pre-diagnostic 24-h urine samples. Positive urinary iCOCI (≥ 0.6 COM eqv., g/L) was accounted for 51% (144/281), and the rest of 49% (137/281) were negative. Non-contrast CT imaging (reference standard) was subsequently performed for the definite diagnosis of urolithiasis to divide the participants into two groups, non-stone subjects (NSS, n = 122) and stone-forming subjects (SFS, n = 159). It should be noted that only subjects who currently had urinary stone at the time of study were classified as SFS. Urinary iCOCI levels in the SFS were significantly higher than the NSS. ROC analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.893 (95% CI: 0.855–0.932) in separating NSS from all SFS. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, positive likelihood ratio (LH+) and negative likelihood ratio (LH−) of urinary iCOCI test for diagnosis of all urolithiasis were 87%, 80%, 84%, 84%, 83%, 4.44 and 0.16, respectively. Of 159 SFS, 38 were confirmed to have CaOx stones. Among these 38 CaOx SFS, only 2 had negative urinary iCOCI test. The AUC of urinary iCOCI test for separating CaOx SFS from NSS was markedly high (0.946, 95% CI: 0.914–0.978). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, LH+ and LH− of urinary iCOCI test for diagnosing CaOx urolithiasis were 95%, 86%, 68%, 98%, 88%, 6.80 and 0.06, respectively. Conclusion, we clinically validated that an innovative non-invasive urinary iCOCI test was highly accurate to diagnose urolithiasis, especially CaOx stone. With its high sensitivity and NPV, urinary iCOCI test is clinically intended to use as a screening test for CaOx urolithiasis. LH− of 0.06 indicates that negative result of urinary iCOCI test is highly accurate to rule out the CaOx stone formation. It is noted that urinary iCOCI level is expressed as arbitrary unit, and it is not directly related to the actual physiological level of urinary oxalate."
"['Psychiatry and Mental Health', 'Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience', 'Biological Psychiatry']","Evidence-based umbrella review of 162 peripheral biomarkers for major mental disorders  2020, The Author(s).The literature on non-genetic peripheral biomarkers for major mental disorders is broad, with conflicting results. An umbrella review of meta-analyses of non-genetic peripheral biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia, including first-episode psychosis. We included meta-analyses that compared alterations in peripheral biomarkers between participants with mental disorders to controls (i.e., between-group meta-analyses) and that assessed biomarkers after treatment (i.e., within-group meta-analyses). Evidence for association was hierarchically graded using a priori defined criteria against several biases. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) instrument was used to investigate study quality. 1161 references were screened. 110 met inclusion criteria, relating to 359 meta-analytic estimates and 733,316 measurements, on 162 different biomarkers. Only two estimates met a priori defined criteria for convincing evidence (elevated awakening cortisol levels in euthymic BD participants relative to controls and decreased pyridoxal levels in participants with schizophrenia relative to controls). Of 42 estimates which met criteria for highly suggestive evidence only five biomarker aberrations occurred in more than one disorder. Only 15 meta-analyses had a power >0.8 to detect a small effect size, and most (81.9%) meta-analyses had high heterogeneity. Although some associations met criteria for either convincing or highly suggestive evidence, overall the vast literature of peripheral biomarkers for major mental disorders is affected by bias and is underpowered. No convincing evidence supported the existence of a trans-diagnostic biomarker. Adequately powered and methodologically sound future large collaborative studies are warranted."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Interleukin-34 overexpression mediated through tumor necrosis factor-alpha reflects severity of synovitis in knee osteoarthritis  2020, The Author(s).This study aimed to investigate whether interleukin-34 (IL-34) mRNA expression is aberrant and modulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in knee osteoarthritis (OA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and determine associations of IL-34 mRNA and protein in the systemic and local joint environments with severity of knee OA synovitis. Transcriptional and translational IL-34 levels in FLS, synovium, synovial fluid, and plasma of knee OA were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relative mRNA expressions of NF-κB signaling molecules were further measured. In knee OA FLS stimulated with TNF-α, IL-34 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in a time-dependent manner. In knee OA synovium with severe synovitis, increased IL-34 mRNA expression was directly associated with IL-6, IκB, NF-κB, and MMP-13, in addition to knee OA FLS. Immunostaining score of IL-34 was considerably greater in knee OA synovium with severe synovitis than that in those with mild and no synovitis. Increments in joint fluid and plasma IL-34 levels in knee OA patients with severe synovitis were closely related to its mRNA and protein expressions in knee OA synovium. Transcriptional and translational expressions of IL-34 were positively correlated with synovitis severity. Collectively, IL-34 overexpression would reflect synovitis severity in knee OA."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Nephrectomy Does not Exacerbate Cancellous Bone loss in Thalassemic Mice  2020, The Author(s).Patients with β-thalassemia have an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease which is associated with osteoporosis and periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate mandibular and femoral bone change in heterozygous β-globin knockout (BKO) mice following 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx). Female and male BKO mouse blood smears demonstrated microcytic hypochromic anemia. Serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, and phosphorus levels were not changed in BKO mice. Nx increased the serum levels of urea nitrogen in both wild type (WT) and BKO mice and the level was much higher in BKO males. Serum level of creatinine was increased in Nx WT but not BKO mice. However, serum calcium and phosphorus levels were not altered. Nx induced comparable renal fibrosis in BKO mice and WT controls. Bone loss was observed in mandibular cancellous bone but not cortical bone of both male and female BKO mice. Nx decreased cancellous bone volume and cortical thickness in WT. Interestingly, BKO mice were resistant to Nx-induced cancellous bone loss. However, cortical thickness and cortical bone mineral density were reduced in Nx male BKO mice. Nx increased mRNA levels of type I collagen, Osx and Trap in WT but not BKO mice. Similarly, Nx reduced cancellous bone volume in femurs and increased osteoblast number and osteoclast number in WT not BKO mice. Serum FGF23 and erythropoietin levels were markedly increased in BKO mice. Nx decreased serum erythropoietin but not FGF23 levels. Since WT treated with erythropoietin exhibited a significant reduction in cancellous bone volume, it was possible that lower level of erythropoietin in Nx BKO mice prevented the Nx-induced cancellous bone loss."

Here, we developed a rapid, specific and sensitive visual detection of sea using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) combined with nanogold probe (AuNP) or styryl dye (STR). LAMP-AuNP and LAMP-STR can detect as low as 9.7 fg (3.2 sea copies) and 7.2 sea copies, respectively, which were lower than PCR (97 fg or 32 sea copies). The excellent performance of these new assays was demonstrated in food samples using crude DNA lysates. While the culture method detected 104 CFU/g in ground pork and 10 CFU/mL in milk in 5–7 days, LAMP-AuNP could detect down to 10 CFU/g for both samples in 27 minutes. Analyzing 80 pork and milk samples revealed that the LAMP-AuNP showed 100% sensitivity, 97–100% specificity and 97.5–100% accuracy, which were superior to the culture method, and comparable to PCR but without requirement of a thermal cycler. Furthermore, our LAMP-AuNP detect sea at a range below the food safety control (<100 CFU/g). The LAMP-STR quantitated sea in 10–1,000 CFU (7.2–720 copies). Our crude DNA lysis combined with LAMP-AuNP/STR present effective point-of-care detection and facilitate appropriate control strategies."

WO3/Si-Al and hydrotalcite were selected as the catalyst and binder, respectively. The reaction kinetics and mathematical models of catalyst pellet with Knudsen diffusion and one-dimensional axial dispersion reactor were developed and simulated using gPROMS to investigate the performance of propylene self-metathesis over the catalyst pellet. A sensitivity analysis of various operating conditions and parameters such as catalyst pore size and pellet size was performed to determine optimal pellet diameter and pore size to maximize the combined yield of ethylene and butenes at minimal C5+ yield. Simulation results revealed optimal catalysts with pellet diameter and pore size ranging from 0.14-5.3 mm and 42-132 Å, respectively depending on operating conditions."

We hypothesized that HEV might persist at a subclinical level and might pose clinical risks in the post-LT period. We performed a cross-sectional study with 108 post-LT patients and found an IgG seroprevalence of 55.6%. Subsequently, 91 cases without clinical evidence of HEV-related hepatitis were enrolled in 1 year of prospective follow-up to determine clinical status, serologies and serum/feces HEV RNA every 4 months. HEV RNA was detected, indicating subclinical infections in patients with or without seropositivity, with an annual incidence of 7.7%. Our results suggest that subclinical HEV infection exists among LT patients in this high-prevalence area. Thus, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of disease reemergence and HEV viral transmission in LT patients."
['Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine'],"SEA-MAKE score as a tool for predicting major adverse kidney events in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: results from the SEA-AKI study  2020, The Author(s).Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common problem in critically ill patients and associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recently, Major Adverse Kidney Events (MAKE) were introduced as important kidney endpoints. If these endpoints can be predicted, then it may help the physicians to identify high-risk patients and provide the opportunity to have targeted preventive therapy. The objective of this study was to create a simplified scoring system to predict MAKE within 28 days among AKI patients in ICU. Methods: This is a prospective web-based multicenter cohort study that was conducted in adults who were admitted to the ICU in 17 centers across Thailand from 2013 to 2015. A predicting score was derived from the regression equation with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic test and produce predictive models. Internal validation was obtained using the bootstrapping method. Results: From 5071 cases, 2856 (56%) had AKI. Among those with AKI, 1749 (61%) had MAKE. Among those that have MAKE, there were 1175 (41.4%) deaths, 414 (14.4%) were on dialysis and 1154 (40.7%) had non-recovery renal function. The simplified score points of low Glasgow coma scale was 3, tachypnea was 1, vasopressor use was 1, on mechanical ventilation was 2, oliguria was 2, serum creatinine rising ≥ 3 times was 5, high blood urea nitrogen was 3, low hematocrit was 2, and thrombocytopenia was 1. The area under ROC curve for optimism corrected performance was 0.80 (0.78, 0.81). When the cut-off value was 7, the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and positive predictive values were 0.75, 0.76, 3.10, and 0.84, respectively. When the scoring system was calibrated, the α intercept and β slope were 1.001 and 0, respectively. Conclusions: SEA-MAKE scoring system is a new simplified clinical tool that can be used to predict major adverse kidney events in AKI patients. The simplicity of the scoring system is highly likely to be used in resource-limited settings. However, external validation is necessary before widespread use."
