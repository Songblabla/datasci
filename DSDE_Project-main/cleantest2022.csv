"['Biotechnology', 'Bioengineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","Reduction of algal wall-growth biofilm for the cultivation of Chlorococcum in photobioreactors using commercial surfactants and floating plastic media  2022 Elsevier B.V.During the cultivation of Chlorococcum humicola in photobioreactors (PBRs), significant biofilm formation occurred, leading to light limitation and lower productivity. This work presents the possibility of using commercial surfactants to reduce wall-growth biofilm in PBRs. Results confirm that sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 0.0082 mM can successfully control wall-growth biofilm in the cultivation of C. humicola more than CTAB and Triton X-100. The addition of SDS into 2-L PBRs, built from either acrylic or glass, results in 68–158 % and 28–43 % increases in algal biomass concentrations compared to those without SDS addition. PBRs applying with SDS at the start of the cultivation can be operated for 23 days without stopping aeration to remove biofilm. Both SDS and floating plastic media were effective in algal biofilm control when applying in 60-L PBRs. The addition of SDS is seen to offer a practical solution to reduce algal biofilm on both glass and acrylic surfaces and promote higher biomass concentration during the cultivation."

Studies suggest that phytochemicals are capable of inhibiting fibril formation. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory effects of anthocyanins, including cyanidin, cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R), malvidin, and malvidin-3-glucoside (M3G) on fibril formation. Our results revealed that anthocyanins (50–200 μM) significantly reduced the formation of insulin fibrils by increasing lag times and decreasing ThT fluorescence at the plateau phase. These findings were confirmed by TEM images, which showed reduced fibril length and number. Furthermore, FTIR analysis indicated that anthocyanins reduced the secondary structure transition of insulin from α-helix to β-sheet. Anthocyanins interacted with monomeric insulin (residues B8–B30) via H-bonds, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions, covering the fibril-prone segments of insulin (residues B12–B17). Based on the structure-activity analysis, the presence of glycosides and hydroxyl groups on phenyl rings increased intermolecular interaction, mediating the inhibitory effect of anthocyanins on fibril formation in the order of malvidin < cyanidin < M3G < C3G < C3R. Moreover, anthocyanins formed H-bonds with preformed insulin fibrils, except for malvidin. In preadipocytes, C3R, C3G, and cyanidin attenuated insulin fibril-induced cytotoxicity. In conclusion, anthocyanins are effective inhibitors of insulin fibril formation and cytotoxicity."

In this work, κ-Carrageenan (κC) was used as the drug matrix material. The porous κC matrices were fabricated by dissolving the κC in deionized water to obtain hydrogels and then using the freeze-dryer to obtain cryogels. The porous (κC) matrices showed interconnected pore sizes varying between 6.05 to 25.8 nm. In the drug release experiments, the drug diffusion coefficient increased and the drug release duration was reduced with decreasing κC concentration due to the larger κC pore sizes. The diffusion coefficient increased with a shorter release time under the applied electric strength of +1.0 V due to the electro-repulsive force between the Metformin and the anode. For the drug release-permeation of the κC 0.8 % v/v cryogel through the pig skin under applied positive electrical potentials, the amounts of drug release-permeation and diffusion coefficients were enhanced with shorter durations relative to without electrical potential. The κC 0.8 % v/v matrix at the applied electric strength of +6.0 V has been shown here to be potential to be used as the Metformin transdermal controlled delivery patch for abdominal obesity and diabetes."

MEA and PZ are two promoters used to facilitate several individual aqueous single solvents including BEA, AMP, BDEA, and MDEA. In order to check the altered performance of absorption and desorption, the solvents were specified at 2.5 M. The initial desorption rate was evaluated by varying the temperature, weight of the solid catalyst, and initial rich CO2 loading. The experimental results were then taken to compare with the obtained data of the benchmark solution (2.5 M MEA). The comparison results revealed that all the selected blank solvent blends can provide better absorption and desorption performance than the blank benchmark solution. The results also indicated that the performance of catalyst-aided CO2 desorption could be strongly affected by the rich loading and operating temperature. Meaning that the activation of proton donation by HZSM-5 was patently affected by the above two conditions, which eventually affect the CO2 separation from the rich solvent."

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high utilization, selectivity, and activity have cut a great splash in past years. Here, we showed four (B-1, B-2, W-1, and W-2 terminated) WB2 (0 0 1) surfaces are promising alternative supports for low-cost transition metal (TM) SACs toward NRR. After the density-functional-theory (DFT) high-throughput screening, the results show that the single Cr atoms anchored on site 1 of W-1 and W-2 terminations serve as the most active catalytic center among all TMs, the limiting potentials of Cr@(W-1@1) and Cr@(W-2@1) are only −0.28 V and −0.37 V, respectively. Besides, the single V atom anchored on B-1@3 and single Mn atoms anchored on B-2@3 shows the best NRR performances. The limiting potentials of V@(B-1@3) and Mn@(B-2@3) are only around −0.19 V and −0.28 V, respectively. What's more, the excellent selectivities of Cr@(W-1@1), Cr@(W-1@1), V@(B-1@3), and Mn@(B-2@3) to NRR were further confirmed. This work proposes new single atom-substrate pairs and offers systematical insights into the design scheme for high-efficient NH3 production on WB2 (0 0 1) surfaces-supported SACs."

Therefore, efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts are urgently needed to replace precious metal catalysts and meet ecological and environmental protection standards. Herein, Ni–Mn–P electrocatalysts are synthesized using facile electrodeposition technology. The influence of the Mn addition on the catalytic behavior is studied by the comprehensive analysis of catalytic performance and morphology of the catalysts. Among them, the Ni–Mn–P0.01 catalyst exhibits small coral-like structures, greatly improving the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen ions and reducing the overpotential hydrogen evolution. Consequently, overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 electric current density is 113 mV, and the value of the Tafel slope achieves 74 mV/dec. Furthermore, the Ni–Mn–P catalyst shows long-time (20 h) stability at current densities of 10 and 60 mA/cm2. The results confirm that the synergistic effect of Ni, Mn, and P accelerates the electrochemical reaction. Meanwhile, the addition of manganese element can change the micromorphology of the catalyst, thereby exposing more active sites to participate in the reaction, enhancing water ionization, improving the catalytic performance. This study opens a new way toward improving the activity of the catalyst by adjusting Mn concentration during the electrodeposition process."

Though they have served as an excellent protection source in minimizing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreading, they have still emerged as major environmental pollutants nowadays. These non-degradable COVID-19 plastic wastes (CPW) were treated through incineration and landfilling process, which may lead to either the release of harmful gases or contaminating the surrounding environment. Further, they can cause numerous health hazards to the human and animal populations. These plastic wastes can be efficiently managed through thermochemical processes like pyrolysis or gasification, which assist in degrading the plastic waste and also effectively convert them into useful energy-yielding products. The pyrolysis process promotes the formation of liquid fuels and chemicals, whereas gasification leads to syngas and hydrogen fuel production. These energy-yielding products can help to compensate for the fossil fuels depletion in the near future. There are many insights explained in terms of the types of reactors and influential factors that can be adopted for the pyrolysis and gasification process, to produce high efficient energy products from the wastes. In addition, advanced technologies including co-gasification and two-stage gasification were also reviewed."
"['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Fuel Technology', 'Condensed Matter Physics', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology']","Recent progress of electrocatalysts for hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cells  2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCDue to stringent environmental regulations and the limited resources of fossil-based fuels, there is an urgent demand for clean and eco-friendly energy conversion devices. These criteria appear to be met by hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). PEMFCs have attracted tremendous attention on account of their excellent performance with tunable operability and good portability. Nonetheless, their practical applications are hugely influenced by the scarcity and high cost of platinum (Pt) used as electrocatalysts at both cathode and anode. Pt is also susceptible to easy catalyst poisoning. Herein, this paper reviews the progress of the research regarding the development of electrocatalysts practically used in hydrogen PEMFCs, where the corner-stone reactions are cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). To reduce the costs of PEMFCs, lessening or eliminating the use of Pt is of prime importance. For current and forthcoming laboratory/large-scale PEMFCs, there is much interest in developing substitute catalysts based on cheaper materials. As such are non-platinum (non-Pt), non-platinum group metals (non-PGMs), metal oxides, and non-metal electrocatalysts. Hence, high-performance, state-of-the-art, and novel structured electrocatalysts as replacements for Pt are needed."

All rights reserved.Intrinsic reaction kinetics is an essential information in catalytic reaction engineering. This paper reviews the two laboratory reactors, i.e., the packed-bed reactor and gradient-less recycle reactor commonly employed for determining the intrinsic reaction kinetics of heterogeneous catalysts. Although both reactors have been well-known for kinetic studies for a long time, there are still efforts to address some essential issues and to further develop the reactors. For example, a new design of the gradient-less recycle reactor was developed to broaden the operating window for intrinsic kinetic studies at low pressure. Furthermore, the intrinsic kinetic modeling in the gradient-less recycle reactor and packed-bed reactor, including the effects of mass transfer and axial dispersion, was also investigated. This review article provides in detail the types of both reactors, the development of both packed-bed reactor and gradient-less recycle reactor, intrinsic kinetic modeling, and the methods for determining heat-and mass-transfer limitations. All of these point out the suitable methods for determining intrinsic kinetics and perspectives for future works."

Risk factors for an impaired immune response are yet to be determined. We aimed to summarize the COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity and to identify factors that influence the humoral immune response in patients with MM. Two reviewers independently conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane library, and Clinicaltrials.gov from existence until 24 May 24 2022. (PROSPERO: CRD42021277005). A total of 15 studies were included in the systematic review and 5 were included in the meta-analysis. The average rate (range) of positive functional T-lymphocyte response was 44.2% (34.2%-48.5%) after 2 doses of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines. The average antispike antibody response rates (range) were 42.7% (20.8%-88.5%) and 78.2% (55.8%-94.2%) after 1 and 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. The average neutralizing antibody response rates (range) were 25% (1 study) and 62.7% (53.3%-68.6%) after 1 and 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. Patients with high-risk cytogenetics or receiving anti-CD38 therapy were less likely to have a humoral immune response with pooled odds ratios of 0.36 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.18, 0.69), I2 = 0% and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.22, 0.79), I2 = 14%, respectively. Patients who were not on active MM treatment were more likely to respond with pooled odds ratio of 2.42 (95% CI, 1.10, 5.33), I2 = 7%. Patients with MM had low rates of humoral and cellular immune responses to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal doses of vaccines and evaluate the use of monoclonal antibodies for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this population."

Despite the serious public health threat presented by CV-A6 infections, our understanding of the mechanisms by which new CV-A6 strains emerge remains limited. This study investigated the molecular epidemiological trends, evolutionary dynamics, and recombination characteristics of CV-A6-associated HFMD in Thailand between 2019 and 2022. In the HFMD patient samples collected during the 4-year study period, we identified enterovirus (EV) RNA in 368 samples (48.7%), of which CV-A6 (23.7%) was the predominant genotype, followed by CV-A4 (6%), EV-A71 (3.7%), and CV-A16 (3.4%). According to the partial viral protein (VP) 1 sequences, all these CV-A6 strains belonged to the D3 clade. Based on the viral-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, four recombinant forms (RFs), RF-A (147, 84.5%), RF-N (11, 6.3%), RF-H (1, 0.6%), and newly RF-Y (15, 8.6%), were identified throughout the study period. Results from the similarity plot and bootscan analyses revealed that the 3D polymerase (3Dpol) region of the D3/RF-Y subclade consists of sequences highly similar to CV-A10. We envisage that the epidemiological and evolutionarily insights presented in this manuscript will contribute to the development of vaccines to prevent the spread of CV-A6 infection."

All rights reserved.To utilize intermittent renewable energy as well as achieve the goals of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality, various electrocatalytic devices have been developed. However, the electrocatalytic reactions, e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in overall water splitting, polysulfide conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries, formation/decomposition of lithium peroxide in lithium-oxygen batteries, and nitrate reduction reaction to degrade sewage, suffer from sluggish kinetics caused by multielectron transfer processes. Owing to the merits of accelerated charge transport, optimized adsorption/desorption of intermediates, raised conductivity, regulation of the reaction microenvironment, as well as ease to combine with geometric characteristics, the built-in electric field (BIEF) is expected to overcome the above problems. Here, we give a Review about the very recent progress of BIEF for efficient energy electrocatalysis. First, the construction strategies and the characterization methods (qualitative and quantitative analysis) of BIEF are summarized. Then, the up-To-date overviews of BIEF engineering in electrocatalysis, with attention on the electron structure optimization and reaction microenvironment modulation, are analyzed and discussed in detail. In the end, the challenges and perspectives of BIEF engineering are proposed.

Published by Cambridge University Press.Background. There is strong comorbidity between atherosclerosis (ATS) and depression which is attributed to increased atherogenicity, insulin resistance (IR), and immune and oxidative stress. Aim of the study. To examine the role of the above pathways and mu-opioid receptor (MOR), β-endorphin levels, zinc, copper, vitamin D3, calcium, and magnesium in depression due to ATS/unstable angina (UA). Methods. Biomarkers were assayed in 58 controls and 120 ATS patients divided into those with moderate and severe depression according to the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores >19 and >29, respectively. Results. Neural network and logistic regression models showed that severe depression due to ATS/UA was best predicted by interleukin-6 (IL-6), UA, MOR, zinc, β-endorphin, calcium and magnesium, and that moderate depression was associated with IL-6, zinc, MOR, β-endorphin, UA, atherogenicity, IR, and calcium. Neural networks yielded a significant discrimination of severe and moderate depression with an area under the receiver operating curves of 0.831 and 0.931, respectively. Using Partial Least Squares path analysis, we found that 66.2% of the variance in a latent vector extracted from ATS/UA clinical features, and the BDI-II scores, atherogenicity, and IR could be explained by the regression on IL-6, IL-10, zinc, copper, calcium, MOR, and age. The BDI-II scores increased from controls to ATS to UA class III to UA class IV. Conclusions. Immune activation, the endogenous opioid system, antioxidants, trace elements, and macrominerals modulate a common core shared by increased depressive symptoms, ATS, UA, atherogenicity, and IR."

Therapeutic approaches for canine diabetes remain a challenge. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects and is beneficial for humans with diabetes mellitus (DM); however, data on its impact on canine diabetes is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the potential for causing adverse effects, anti-inflammatory effects, anti-oxidative effects and proteomic patterns of curcuminoid supplementation on canine DM. Methods: Altogether, 18 dogs were divided into two groups: DM (n = 6) and healthy (n = 12). Curcuminoid 250 mg was given to the DM group orally daily for 180 days. Blood and urine sample collection for hematological parameters, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, oxidative stress parameters, inflammatory markers and proteomics were performed every 6 weeks. Results and discussion: Curcuminoid supplementation with standard therapy significantly decreased oxidative stress with the increased glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio, but cytokine levels were unaffected. According to the proteomic analysis, curcuminoid altered the expression of alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, transthyretin, apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-IV, suggesting that curcuminoid improves insulin sensitivity and reduces cardiovascular complications. No negative impact on clinical symptoms, kidneys or liver markers was identified. This study proposed that curcuminoids might be used as a targeted antioxidant strategy as an adjunctive treatment to minimize diabetes complications in dogs."

For decades, this large number of migrant workers from Myanmar has benefited the Thailand-Myanmar border trade, both directly and indirectly, including the remittances that Burmese migrant workers send to their families back home. This paper studies how the economic activities revolving around border trade developed. It describes how informal remittances from Myanmar migrant workers have become one of the key elements of the massive illicit border trade and intro-duces the possibility of digital technology replacing traditional informal remittance methods. The data presented here was collected by way of semi-structured interviews with 32 Burmese migrant workers living and working in Samutsakorn Province, nine Thai border traders in Mae Sot, officials, and a Thai financial technology company operating in Myanmar. The interviews revealed that most of the migrant workers had experience using mobile banking and financial applications, they were familiar with the technology, and they were aware of its capacity as an alternative method of sending money back home. However, many still preferred to use informal banking as it benefited them the most. The border traders interviewed for this paper further confirmed that there was still no threat of consequences for payment offsetting. Therefore, the digitalization of banking strengthens the informal banking system as it both hastens and improves the processes of money distribution."

This study was mainly focused on mudstone samples in some parts of the Huai Hin Lat Formation. The samples can be divided into three groups based on their mineral compositions as follows: coaly mudstone, carbonate-siliceous mudstone, and carbonate mudstone. The brittleness index based on their mineral compositions indicates that the samples show ultra-high carbonate and quartz contents, which suggests a good hydraulic fracture candidate. Total organic carbon and extractable organic matter of the samples represents poor to excellent generation potential for hydrocarbon source rock with type III kerogen. The depositional environment shows that the Huai Hin Lat Formation occurs in anoxic to suboxic conditions in an aquatic depositional environment. The formation is suitable for geological CO2 storage, which may reduce CO2 during petroleum production and increase the production rate.

Out of many other sources, municipal solid waste land disposal methods, both controlled landfills and open dumping are observed to be one of the major sources of MPs origination as the predominant quantity of plastic wastes generated is being discarded in those methods. In this study, quantification, and characterization of MPs from the leachate generated from two different solid waste disposal methods and in their respective individual treatment systems were identified. From the studies, 20 different polymer types were spotted with the concentrations in the fresh leachate as 8.80 MPs/L and 9.93 MPs/L in the controlled landfill and open dumping, respectively. The fibers, films, and fragments are found to be the predominant polymer shapes in both the discarding process. Polypropylene and Polyethylene are the main prevailing polymer type in the controlled landfill, whereas polyethylene and polystyrene are in open dumping leachate samples. In addition, the analysis of the treatment system reveals that the ongoing units can remove the MPs from the leachate to some extent. For example, it removed ∼57.1% of MPs from landfill leachate using biological treatment combined with disinfection. Whereas ∼75.2% from the aerated lagoon and membrane treatment for leachate from the open dumping. More fibers with varying polymer types were identified from the effluent of membrane treatment, which is due to the membrane used. Finally, 37 MPs/g from dewatered sludge and ∼500 MPs/L of return sludge indicate the possibility of MPs that can reenter the biological system allowing an increase in the MPs abundance in the biological unit."

Studies with preclinical subjects or not focusing on EZ localization or surgical outcome prediction using recently developed PET radiopharmaceuticals, novel image analysis techniques, and new software were excluded from the review. The remaining 162 articles were reviewed. Results: We first present recent findings and developments in PET radiopharmaceuticals. Second, we present novel image analysis techniques and new software in the last decade for EZ localization. Finally, we summarize the overall findings and discuss future perspectives in the field of PET and SPECT in epilepsy. Conclusion: Combining new radiopharmaceutical development, new indications, new techniques, and software improves EZ localization and provides a better understanding of epilepsy. These have proven not to only predict prognosis but also to improve the outcome of epilepsy surgery."
"['Immunology and Allergy', 'Immunology']","cGAS deficiency enhances inflammasome activation in macrophages and inflammatory pathology in pristane-induced lupus Copyright  2022 Kumpunya, Thim-uam, Thumarat, Leelahavanichkul, Kalpongnukul, Chantaravisoot, Pisitkun and Pisitkun.Introduction: Type I interferon (IFN) plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Cyclic GMP AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that recognizes dsDNA and creates cGAMP to activate STING-mediated type I IFN production. The activation of STING induces lupus disease in Fcgr2b deficient mice through the differentiation of dendritic cells. In contrast, Cgas-deficient mice could be generated more autoantibody production and proteinuria in pristane-induced lupus (PIL). These data suggested that the other dsDNA sensors could be involved in lupus development mechanisms. Methods: This study aimed to identify the cGAS-mediated mechanisms contributing to lupus pathogenesis in PIL. The Cgas-deficient and WT mice were induced lupus disease with pristane and subsequently analyzed autoantibody, histopathology, and immunophenotypes. The lung tissues were analyzed with the expression profiles by RT-PCR and western blot. The bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with inflammasome activators and observed pyroptosis. Results: The Cgas-/- mice developed more severe pulmonary hemorrhage and autoantibody production than WT mice. The activated dendritic cells, IFN-g-, and IL-17a-producing T helper cells, and infiltrated macrophages in the lung were detected in Cgas-/- mice higher than in WT mice. We observed an increase in expression of Aim2, Casp11, and Ifi16 in the lung and serum IL-1a but IL-1b in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice. The rise of Caspase-11 in the lung of pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggested noncanonical inflammasome activation. The activation of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) enhanced the number of dead cells in Cgas-/- mice compared with WT mice. Activation of the inflammasome significantly induced pyroptosis in Cgas-/- BMDMs. The dsDNA level, but not mitochondrial DNA, increased dramatically in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggesting the dsDNA could be a ligand activating inflammasomes. The cGAS agonist-induced BMDM activation in the Cgas-/- mice indicated that the activation of DNA sensors other than cGAS enhanced activated macrophages. Conclusion: These findings suggested that cGAS hampers the unusual noncanonical inflammasome activation through other DNA sensors."
['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"De Sitter Bubbles from Anti-de Sitter Fluctuations  2022 American Physical Society.Cosmological acceleration is difficult to accommodate in theories of fundamental interactions involving supergravity and superstrings. An alternative is that the acceleration is not universal but happens in a large localized region, which is possible in theories admitting regular black holes with de Sitter-like interiors. We considerably strengthen this scenario by placing it in a global anti-de Sitter background, where the formation of ""de Sitter bubbles""will be enhanced by mechanisms analogous to the Bizoń-Rostworowski instability in general relativity. This opens an arena for discussing the production of multiple accelerating universes from anti-de Sitter fluctuations. We demonstrate such collapse enhancement by explicit numerical work in the context of a simple two-dimensional dilaton-gravity model that mimics the spherically symmetric sector of higher-dimensional gravities."

Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.Introduction: The study aimed to determine a reference database of the thickness and intraocular thickness asymmetry of total retina, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL) in healthy Thai subjects measured by the Spectralis spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited the healthy subjects age ≥18 years, having spherical refraction within ±6 diopters and cylindrical refraction ±3 diopters, from a hospital's personnel and the people visiting the ophthalmology department. Only 1 eye of each subject was randomly selected for an analysis. Macular images were obtained using posterior pole thickness scan protocol over a 24° × 24° area at the center of the fovea. The automated retinal thickness segmentation values of total retina and three inner retinal layers were calculated for the mean and the mean intraocular thickness difference between superior and inferior retinal hemispheres. The influence of age, gender, and axial length on thickness and thickness asymmetry of individualized retinal layer was evaluated. Results: 252 subjects were included in study with a mean (SD) age of 46.7 (15.8) years, and 120 (47.6%) were males. According to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study map, the inner ring area was the thickest location of the total retina (range; 326.0-341.5 μm), GCL (range; 47.7-52.7 μm), and IPL (range; 39.9-42.1 μm), whereas the thickest location of RNFL was at the outer ring area (range; 18.8-47.5 μm). For posterior pole intraocular thickness asymmetry, the greatest mean ± SD difference was observed for total retina (9.0 ± 2.2 μm), followed by RNFL (9.9 ± 3.2 μm) and GCL (2.7 ± 0.6 μm), and the lowest mean difference was noted for IPL (2.4 ± 0.5 μm). The thickness and thickness asymmetry of each retinal layer were variably influenced by age, gender, and axial length; however, these factors had a minimal influence on the thickness asymmetry maps of GCL and RNFL. Conclusion: The reference database of the macular thickness and thickness asymmetry from this study would be beneficial in determining physiologic variations of the OCT parameters in the healthy Thai population."
"['Instrumentation', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","Prescreening MCI and Dementia Using Shank-Mounted IMU during TUG Task  2001-2012 IEEE.Detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (DEM) is an important topic because, unless it is treated early, MCI can progress to DEM, which is an untreatable disease. This article proposes a timed-up-and-go (TUG) task features analysis and classification of MCI and DEM using inertial measurement units (IMUs) in wearable devices. Our goal is to create a generalized model that can be used for preclinical screening. As a result, rather than classifying only one subtype of DEM, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), we classify all subtypes as DEM. We also utilize feature selection methods on features from TUG tasks to optimize the MCI and DEM classification performance. From the results, our generalized model can outperform other works in normal control (NC)-MCI&DEM classification with an accuracy of 86.94% and sensitivity of 97.40%. For NC-DEM classification, the performance of our generalized model is slightly lower than that of specific-subtype models (e.g., NC versus AD). However, our generalized model can outperform the specific-subtype models when using a diverse variety of subtypes. It is a reasonable tradeoff, and it can be a good first step toward a future where the patient can preclinically self-screening the cognitive impairments using wearable devices in free-living environments. This could allow patients to notice the cognitive impairment early on and seek a comprehensive diagnosis from a doctor."
['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"Evaluation of machine learning models for load-carrying capacity assessment of semi-rigid steel structures  2022 Elsevier LtdThe paper investigates the potential application of machine learning methods to estimate the load-carrying capacity of semi-rigid connected steel structures. The database is developed using the advanced analysis based on beam-column and zero-length elements. The input variables are member cross-sections and parameters of the high-order nonlinear functions describing semi-rigid connection behaviors. Twelve machine learning algorithms, including three linear regression models, support vector machines, deep learning and seven tree-based ensemble algorithms, were evaluated. Three practical semi-rigid connected steel (including two-dimensional planar and three-dimensional space) structures were studied. The numerical results revealed that the distribution of the load-carrying capacity responses of the structures was non-normal and heavy-tailed. The class of linear regression methods was less efficient than the tree-based ensemble algorithms. Among the seven tree-based ensemble approaches, the extreme gradient boosting method presented the best performance in determining not only the lowest (mean squared, mean absolute and mean absolute percentage) errors but also the highest coefficient of determination. It was followed by the light gradient boosting machines and categorical gradient boosting algorithms. Three linear regression methods (linear regression, Lasso and Ridge), light gradient boosting machines, categorical gradient boosting and extreme gradient boosting provided the competitive computing cost. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm was therefore recommended for the accurate prediction of load-carrying capacities of semi-rigid connected steel frames."

In the current study, the influences of electrochemical reaction related to gas concentration distribution inside the fuel electrode on carbon deposition in the vicinities of an electrolyte and the electrode surface were experimentally investigated. A fabricated two- or three-layer structured anode with a detector layer consisting of 50% Ni and 50% Al2O3 for the two-layer anode or 10% Ni and 90% YSZ for the three-layer anode was used. FE-SEM images of the detector layer in the three-layer structured anode clearly suggest the important roles of electrochemical reactions in suppressing carbon deposition by providing oxygen ions and increasing water concentration inside the anode. In addition, the observed carbon deposition at the Ni/Al2O3 top detector layer of the two-layer structured electrode indicates that the surface of the electrode is more likely to be the location for carbon deposition than the vicinity of the electrolyte. From the results, carbon deposition and no deposition conditions could be disclosed as a function of the amount of H2O supplied in fuel and the amount of oxygen ion produced by electrochemical reaction."

Pseudo first-order reaction rate constant k0 was measured by the stopped-flow apparatus. Zwitterion mechanism was applied to describe the reaction and the k0 was well fitted by the corresponding kinetic model with average absolute relative deviation (AARD) in a range of 1.08%-3.89%. Apparent second-order reaction rate constant KA revealed that the reaction rate is simultaneously controlled by steric hindrance and pKa of amines. Additional alkyl groups increase the steric hindrance of amines and accelerate the decomposition of zwitterions. As a result, the reaction rate decreases with stronger steric hindrance effect. The larger pKa is conducive to a better proton receiving of amine. This leads to an acceleration of the deprotonation reaction of zwitterion intermediate. In addition, the relative influence of steric hindrance and pKa on the reaction kinetics is also related to the solvent environment."

Herein, the NiW solid solution with twin boundaries is successfully fabricated by facile electrodeposition on copper sheet. As compared with Ni, the NiW-0.6A catalyst shows enhanced HER activity in 1 M KOH with the overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA/cm2. Besides, NiW-0.6A exhibits excellent stability for 100 h at 20 mA/cm2.

However, the low bone-implant contact and infections are still potential complications. To pursue the development of nanotubular TiO2 coatings that present suitable characteristics for biomedical application, synthesis variables, and Ag-functionalization were explored. TiO2 coatings were grown over Ticp and Ti6Al4V by potentiostatic anodization (25 V, 90 min, 25 °C), being investigated the substrate, %wt NH4F, electrolyte stirring, and annealing effect on biocompatibility and antimicrobial performance. Samples were characterized by FE-SEM, XDR, and contact angle. The results show that morphology and microstructure are very sensitive to these experimental parameters. Stirring was related to an aggressive dissolution. Static condition can be used to grow nanotubes and enhance anatase stabilization, wettability, and apatite epitaxy. The optimized condition was achieved with annealed 0.75-%wt NH4F, without stirring.

Recently, we have shown that ethyl acetate fraction (HLEA) of the crude extract of the black sea cucumber, Holothuria leucospilota, could alleviate Parkinsonism in Caenorhabditis elegans PD models. In this study, we found that the effective neuroprotective activity is attributed to HLEA-P1 compound chemically isolated and identified in H. leucospilota ethyl acetate. We reported here that HLEA-P1 could attenuate DAergic neurodegeneration, improve DAergic-dependent behaviors, reduce oxidative stress in 6-OHDA-induced C. elegans. In addition, HLEA-P1 reduced α-synuclein aggregation, improved behavior deficit and recovered lipid deposition in transgenic C. elegans overexpressing α-synuclein. We also found that HLEA-P1 activates nuclear localization of DAF-16 transcription factor of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway. Treatment with 25 μg/ml of HLEA-P1 upregulated transcriptional activity of DAF-16 target genes including anti-oxidant genes (such as sod-3) and small heat shock proteins (such as hsp16.1, hsp16.2, and hsp12.6) in 6-OHDA-induced worms. In α-synuclein-overexpressed C. elegans strain, treatment with 5 μg/ml of HLEA-P1 significantly activated mRNA expression of sod-3 and hsp16.2. Chemical analysis demonstrated that HLEA-P1 compound is decanoic acid/capric acid. Taken together, our findings revealed that decanoic acid isolated from H. leucospilota exerts anti-Parkinson effect in C. elegans PD models by partly modulating IIS/DAF-16 pathway."

All rights reserved.This research aims to investigate steam biomass gasification in a pilot horizontal gasifier using rubber wood pellets (RWPs) and eucalyptus wood chips (EWCs) for producing syngas with an H2/CO ratio range of 1.8 to 2.3 for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The study was divided into two parts. One was carried out in a lab-scale reactor to determine the effect of temperature and CaO on the gas product composition and the efficiency of tar removal. Another part was determined by investigating the effect of the steam/biomass (S/B) ratio on the produced H2/CO ratios in the pilot horizontal gasifier, which used the optimum conditions of temperature and % loading of CaO for tar removal according to the optimal conditions from the lab-scale gasifier. The lab-scale gasifier results showed that H2and CO2increased with temperature due to primary and secondary water gas reactions and hydrocarbon reforming reactions. The water gas shift and hydrocarbon reforming reaction depressed the CO and CH4contents with increasing temperature, respectively. The optimum gasifying temperature was 900 °C, which obtained H2/CO ratios of 1.8 for both RWPs and EWCs. The tar yield decreased with increasing temperature and was less than 0.2 wt % when using CaO as a tar-cracking catalyst. The operation of the pilot horizontal gasifier at the operating condition of 900 °C and a S/B ratio of 0.5 using 0.2 wt % loading of CaO for tar removal also produced a H2/CO ratio of 2.0. The supply of an external heat source stabilized the gasifying temperature, resulting in a stable syngas composition and production rate of 2.5 and 2.7 kg/h with H2/CO ratios of 1.8 and 1.9 for the RWPs and EWCs, respectively. In summary, the horizontal gasifier is another effective designed gasifier that showed high-performance operation."

All rights reserved.Multistimuli-responsive polymers are important for controlled release. Owing to the fact that these polymers are derived from vinyl-based monomers, their decoration with other molecules is limited. Polysaccharides, especially chitosan (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA), are pH-responsive biopolymers, whose chemical structures contain reactive functional groups for feasible chemical modifications to obtain add-on functions. The present work demonstrates the introduction of polymers with upper critical solution temperature (UCST) and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) performances onto CS and HA, respectively. By simply varying the mole ratio between the CS-containing UCST polymer and the HA-containing LCST polymer along with adjusting the pH, a polymer system with a UCST-LCST-pH multiresponsive window can be obtained. This multiresponsive window enables us to control the encapsulation and release with repeatability as evidenced from a model study on lysozyme. The present work, for the first time, shows a simple approach to obtain multiresponsive biodegradable polymers through the formation of a single polymer complex to tailor a specific multiresponsive window."

To move toward more resilient system configurations requires understanding the processes that shape farmers' adaptation amidst complex institutional contexts. Social networks are an important part of collective action for supporting adaptive capacity and there are continuing calls to strengthen network connectivity for agricultural governance under the impacts of climate change. Through a survey of 176 farmers in northern Thailand, we explore the extent to which the characteristics of information shared in a catchment advice network are associated with adaptations. Statistical analyses reveal the perceived efficacy of communications as well as farmers' relative closeness in the advice network to be positively associated with adaptation to drought. We identify a capacity for local actors to bridge information bottlenecks in the network and opportunities for institutions to enhance their dissemination of information to reach less networked farmers. We find that not all adaptations are perceived as effective against future drought and infer opportunities to support engagement with extension services, encourage the sharing of local knowledge and experience and devise policy and interventions to strengthen advice networks for more resilient agricultural systems.

The analysis is restricted to the mass ranges mϕ from 25 to 100 GeV and mX from 1 to 3 TeV. For these mass ranges, the decay products of each ϕ boson are expected to merge into a single large-radius jet. Jet substructure and flavor identification techniques are used to identify these jets. The search is based on CERN LHC proton-proton collision data at s=13TeV, collected with the CMS detector in 2016–2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138fb−1. Model-specific limits, where the two new particles arise from an extended Higgs sector, are set on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction for X→ϕϕ→(bb‾)(bb‾) as a function of the resonances' masses, where both the X→ϕϕ and ϕ→bb‾ branching fractions are assumed to be 100%.

For many decades, microalgae and cyanobacteria, photosynthetic living microorganisms, have been explored extensively for wastewater bioremediation. They can be used for recovering valuable nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous from secondary effluents and capable of transforming those nutrients into marketable products such as biofuels, biofertilisers, nutraceutical, and pigments for promoting a Bio-Circular Green economy. In recent years, there has been a shift towards mixing compatible microalgae with bacteria, which is inspired by their natural symbiotic relationships to increase nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries. With this enhanced bioremediation, recovery of polluted wastes can be intensified and higher biomass quality (with high nutrient density) can be achieved. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art of mixed microalgal-bacterial cultivating systems. A comprehensive comparison of existing studies that used Chlorella species as microalgae in various mixed microalgal-bacterial cultivating systems (suspension, biofilm, and immobilisation) for nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries from wastewater is conducted. Key technical challenges such as balancing microalgae and bacteria species, pH regulation, light distribution, biomass harvesting, and biomass conversion are also discussed. From the data comparisons among different cultivation systems, it has been suggested that immobilisation appears to require less amount of operational light compared to the suspended and biofilm-based systems for similar nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies."

For the materialization of real-life SSBs, gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are among promising candidates. However, development of GPEs with satisfying ionic conductivity and mechanical endurance is challenging. Herein, we report on the development of polyacrylamide (PAM)/phosphonated graphene oxide (PGO) nanocomposite hydrogel electrolytes for zinc-ion batteries; PGO acts as the filler through in-situ polymerization of acrylamide in an aqueous suspension of PGO. The synthesized PAM/PGO hydrogel exhibits high ionic conductivity of 31.0 mS/cm at 30 °C compared to that of PAM (13.8 mS/cm) and PAM-GO (20.8 mS/cm). The higher ionic conductivity of PAM-PGO can be attributed to its higher hydrophilicity and electrolyte storage capacity along with its lower activation energy for ionic conduction (7.2 KJ/mol K) in comparison with that of PAM (10.1 KJ/mol K) and PAM-GO (10.2 KJ/mol K). The interaction between water against PAM, PAM-GO and PAM-PGO is investigated via density-functional theory (DFT). The MnO2-based zinc-ion battery assembled using PAM-PGO as electrolyte shows high initial capacity of 240 mAh/g, losing only 4 and 15% of its capacity after 100 and 145 cycles, respectively.

Enhancing the ORR activity of MnO2-based catalysts is necessary for improving the performance of MABs. Defect-engineering of catalyst materials is a key approach for enabling the high performance of ORR. Here, the defect-engineering of α-MnO2 (211) and β-MnO2 (110) by oxygen vacancy (OV) is investigated using the first-principles density functional theory calculation. The geometric structure, adsorption, electronic conductivity, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity are studied. As a result, the OV induces the geometric structure that the Mn–Mn and Mn–O distances are closer when the catalysts lose the oxygen atom(s) on the top-layer surfaces. The presence of OV not only enhances the adsorption energy of *OOH, *O, and *OH, but also increases the electronic conductivity analyzed via the electron transfer. The Bader charge analysis demonstrates that the Mn(IV) can be altered to Mn(III) by the electron accumulation from OV. The volcano plot of ORR overpotential indicates that having the excess OV concentration on MnO2 surfaces cannot enhance the ORR activity. The excellent activity is yielded by 12.50 % OV α-(211) and 66.66 % OV β-(110) with the ORR overpotential of 0.31 V and 0.60 V, respectively. The results demonstrate that Ov is an essential parameter defining the existence of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) on the surface of MnO2-based catalysts. The optimal ratio of Mn(IV):Mn(III) is in challenge developing the α-MnO2 and β-MnO2 electrocatalyst cathode for metal-air batteries.

The recombinant antigenic protein production for use either as a diagnostic reagent or subunit vaccine formulation is usually carried out in prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression platforms. Microbial and mammalian systems dominate the biopharmaceutical industry for such applications. However, there is no universal expression system that can meet all the requirements for different types of proteins.

We predict the existence of hexagonal Ti2CH, Ti2CH2, and Ti2CH4. The dynamic and energetic stabilities of the predicted structures are verified through phonon dispersion and formation energy, respectively. The electron-phonon coupling is carefully investigated by employing isotropic Eliashberg theory. The Tc values are 0.2 K, 2.3 K, and 9.0 K for Ti2CH, Ti2CH2, and Ti2CH4, respectively. The translation and libration adopted by stretch and bent vibrations contribute to the increasing Tc of Ti2CH4. The high-frequency hydrogen modes contribute to the critical temperature increase. Briefly, this work not only highlights the effect of H-content on the increments of Tc for Ti2CHx, but also demonstrates the first theoretical evidence of the existence of H-rich MXene in the example of Ti2CH4.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of physical activity on the regulatory emotional self-efficacy, resilience, and emotional intelligence of nurses and explain their interactions. The present study adopted the cluster sampling method. From April to May 2022, a total of 500 nurses in six municipal hospitals in Changsha City were selected. Finally, 402 valid data samples were obtained. Afterward, AMOS 23.0 (by maximum likelihood estimation) was used to process the collected data and analyze the proposed hypotheses by using 5,000 bootstrap samples to test the mediating effects of the structural equation model. The results demonstrated that there are positive correlations between physical activity and resilience (standardized coefficients = 0.232, p < 0.001), resilience and regulatory emotional self-efficacy (standardized coefficients = 0.449, p < 0.001), and emotional intelligence and regulatory emotional self-efficacy (standardized coefficients = 0.330, p < 0.001). The positive influence of physical activity on emotional regulation self-efficacy is completely mediated by emotional intelligence and resilience (standardized indirect effect = 0.237, p < 0.01), and this explanatory power is far higher than any previous study (R2 = 0.49). The positive emotions generated by an individual’s physical activity have an important explanatory role for individuals who want to establish more emotional regulation self-efficacy, emotional intelligence, and psychological resilience."

These are subsequently used as polyols in preparing polyurethanes (PU) by reacting with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI). The PLA-based PU has an excellent elongation at break of 487%. The products are suitable as toughening agents for brittle PLA resin due to their highly elastic properties and high compatibility with PLA. The PU products are blended with PLA resin at various compositions, and their physical and mechanical properties and shape recovery are examined. The tensile tests showed enhancements in elongation at break up to 160% with low modulus. The fracture morphology and FTIR results confirm that the blends show strong interfacial interaction and adhesion between the PLA-based PU disperse phase and the PLA matrix. The PLA/PU blends exhibit a high shape recovery efficiency, and their recovery mechanisms are identified. These flexible PLA/PU blends are promising for various applications where bio-compatibility/degradability and high ductility are required, especially as filaments for 3D bio-printing."

The critical parameters were optimized, and the process platform was scaled up from 2 ml to 1,000 ml for the efficient recovery of PHB. The physical parameters including continuous shaking, ultrasonication, extraction using the Soxhlet extractor, diluted 1,3-dioxolane, reused 1,3-dioxolane, and cell rupture by steam explosion prior to solvent extraction were carefully investigated. The results showed that continuous shaking played a major role in increasing the recovery efficiency during the scale-up process. The PHB extraction at 2 ml from dried cells at 80°C with 100 rpm of shaking speed for 5 h resulted in a recovery yield of 96.6 ± 0.1% with purity up to 99.1 ± 0.6% and that from wet cells under the same condition resulted in a recovery yield of 94.6 ± 4.8% and purity of 97.0 ± 0.1%. It should be noted that the PHB extracted from wet cells at room temperature with 150 rpm of shaking speed for 36 h resulted in a recovery yield of 93.5 ± 0.7% and purity of 97.7 ± 1.3% and had an MW of 3.1×105, MN of 2.7×105, and polydispersity index of 1.1. The direct scale-up process at 1,000 ml showed comparable results in purity, recovery yield, molecular weight distribution, thermal properties, and mechanical properties. The PHB extraction from dried cells gave the highest purity of 99.3 ± 0.5% and recovery of 94.0 ± 0.3%, whereas the PHB extraction from wet cells gave a purity of 90.3 ± 1.5% and recovery of 92.6 ± 1.0%. The novel recovery process showed its feasibility to be applied on an industrial scale."

As in most of the world, nearly all of the egg-laying hens are housed in cages. While there is growing demand for cage-free eggs in many regions of the world, challenges have been reported when transitioning to these systems, which may affect the willingness of producers to transition. The aim of this research was to investigate the views of Asian egg producers on the feasibility of cage-free systems and what they perceive to be the main challenges and proposed solutions in adopting cage-free systems. A total of 224 egg producers (165 cage egg producers) completed questionnaires containing a mix of free-form, Likert scale and demographic items. Data were analyzed using thematic qualitative analysis and descriptive quantitative statistics. Responses indicated that cages are primarily used for their efficiency and ease of management. The most common reasons to consider adopting cage-free systems included improved animal welfare, increased market access, and increased product quality. A majority of producers (65%) responded “yes” or “maybe” when asked if they consider cage-free systems to be feasible in their country. Perceived challenges in adopting cage-free systems included reduced profitability, higher costs, and biosecurity and disease. Potential solutions included the development of the cage-free industry and market development. Most producers (72%) said more support is needed to establish cage-free farms, mostly pertaining to technical advice, training and resources. The findings of this study provide an enhanced understanding of the egg industry in these countries and potential areas for producer support in transitioning to cage-free systems."

It forms small size immune complexes by binding to free IgE, thereby inhibiting the interaction of IgE with its receptors. Additionally, the anti-IgE can also differently shape the airflow by impeding the stimulation of IgE receptors present on structural cells in the respiratory tract. The present study aimed to use plants as an expression system for anti-human IgE antibody production, using Nicotiana benthamiana as hosts. Recombinant Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) domains of anti-human IgE were co-transformed in N. benthamiana. The assembling of the antibody and its expression was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The functional ability of the anti-IgE antibody was determined via its binding capacity with target IgE by ELISA and the inhibition of basophil activation. The anti-human IgE mAb generated in plants was shown to be effective in binding to its target IgE and inhibit the IgE-crosslink in RS-ATL8 reporter cells. Although, antibody yield and purification process have to be further optimized, this study demonstrates the use of plant expression system as a promising platform for the production of Omalizumab which showed a comparable in vitro function to that of commercial Omalizumab (Xolair) in the inhibition of basophil activation."

This research advances an integrated framework of indicators to assess the interdisciplinary benefits of rural livelihood diversification practices for sustainable local food systems and community resilience. Methods: We built a framework on four dimensions deducted from secondary data: (1) environmental, (2) sociocultural, (3) economic, and (4) health. These were validated with an inductive analysis of primary data, which we collected from a panel of experts with a content validity index and tested in three rural case studies with shadow observation and qualitative interviews. We conducted both in-depth interviews with community leaders (n = 10) and semi-structured interviews with multi-sectoral stakeholders (n = 40). Results: Findings (1) identify a comprehensive list of indicators to assess environmental, sociocultural, economic, and health dimensions of rural livelihood diversification practices and (2) advance a participatory approach to prioritize indicators according to their regional relevance (co-developed with stakeholders involved in Bangkok's local food systems). Food tourism connects the four dimensions by (1) preserving local agrobiodiversity (2) preserving rural communities' traditions (3) creating new capacity building opportunities for community-driven socio-economic development and (4) recognizing the health benefits of indigenous foods. Discussion: This study contributes to a value-added conceptualization of community-based agritourism as a rural livelihood diversification practice. Such research effort highlights the importance of co-producing and ground-truthing indicators for rural livelihood diversification practices localizing sustainable development goals."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Millions of patients suffer from silicosis, but it remains an uncurable disease due to its unclear pathogenic mechanisms. Though the Nlrp3 inflammasome is involved in silicosis pathogenesis, inhibition of its classic downstream factors, Caspase-1 and Gsdmd, fails to block pyroptosis and cytokine release. To clarify the molecular mechanism of silicosis pathogenesis for new therapy, we examined samples from silicosis patients and genetic mouse models. We discovered an alternative pyroptotic pathway which requires cleavage of Gsdme by Caspases-3/8 in addition to Caspase-1/Gsdmd. Consistently, Gsdmd-/-Gsdme-/mice showed markedly attenuated silicosis pathology, and Gsdmd-/-Gsdme-/- macrophages were resistant to silica-induced pyroptosis. Furthermore, we found that in addition to Caspase 1, Caspase-8 cleaved IL-1β in silicosis, explaining why Caspase-1-/- mice also suffered from silicosis. Finally, we found that inhibitors of Caspase-1, -3, -8 or an FDA approved drug, dimethyl fumarate, could dramatically alleviate silicosis pathology through blocking cleavage of Gsdmd and Gsdme. This study highlights that Caspase-1/Gsdmd and Caspase-3/8/Gsdme-dependent pyroptosis is essential for the development of silicosis, implicating new potential targets and drug for silicosis treatment."

All rights reserved.Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating primary brain cancer with a poor prognosis. GBM is associated with an abnormal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, consisting of two distinct kinase complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. The complexes play critical roles in cell proliferation, survival, migration, metabolism, and DNA damage response. This study investigated the aberrant mTORC2 signaling pathway in GBM cells by performing quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of U87MG cells under different drug treatment conditions. Interestingly, a functional analysis of phosphoproteome revealed that mTORC2 inhibition might be involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair. We further characterized the relationship between mTORC2 and BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 1 (BABAM1). We demonstrated that pBABAM1 at Ser29 is regulated by mTORC2 to initiate DNA damage response, contributing to DNA repair and cancer cell survival. Accordingly, the inactivation of mTORC2 significantly ablated pBABAM1 (Ser29), reduced DNA repair activities in the nucleus, and promoted apoptosis of the cancer cells. Furthermore, we also recognized that histone H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 (?H2AX) could be controlled by mTORC2 to repair the DNA. These results provided a better understanding of the mTORC2 function in oncogenic DNA damage response and might lead to specific mTORC2 treatments for brain cancer patients in the future."

Whilst existing literature explores the reception of English trusts law in British colonial territories in Southeast Asia over the course of nineteenth century, little is discussed in relation to Thailand, historically known as Siam, during the same period. Based on the author’s archival research, this article explores the route and development of these trusts and argues that, due to the Thai Supreme Court’s recognition of their charitable purpose, these trusts are not subject to a rule against perpetuities. Therefore, they will continue to present an anomalous exception to Thailand’s civil law legal framework and offer a fascinating example of the deep, tenacious roots put down by a rejected legal concept from Thailand’s brush with nineteenth century colonial powers."

This evidence-based practice has demonstrated increased ART uptake, virologic suppression, and retention in care. However, linkage to care gaps exist in community-based organizations (CBOs) in Bangkok whereby as much as 20% of key populations (KP), mainly men who have sex with men and transgender women, living with HIV were lost to follow-up pre-ART initiation. To increase access to and uptake of ART among these populations, this study proposes that trained KP lay providers should lead community-based ART (CB-SDART) initiation service. This protocol describes the combined use of the Proctor’s implementation outcome framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to guide and evaluate the CB-SDART implementation. Methods: This study follows the hybrid design type 3: it is an implementation trial that secondarily assesses service and client outcomes by comparative interrupted time series analysis. Five strategies have been formulated to meet three implementation outcomes (i.e., feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability): (1) developing stakeholder relationships by engaging the CBO leaderships, (2) training and educating KP lay providers, (3) adapting and tailoring SDART to CBO-specific context, (4) using evaluative and iterative strategies to assess adherence to standard operating procedures, and (5) developing stakeholder relationships by engaging external stakeholders. Teleconsultation with physicians and ART home delivery will be integrated as another ART initiation option for clients and allow service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed-method assessment will be conducted on key stakeholders and PLHIV diagnosed at two implementing CBOs, Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand and Service Workers in Group Foundation, in Bangkok, Thailand. Discussion: This implementation research may be the first to provide robust data at the implementation, service, and client levels to inform how to successfully task-shift SDART initiation service to trained KP lay providers and facilitate the expansion of CB-SDART in the future. Trial registration: This trial was registered with the Thai Clinical Trial Registry as TCTR20210709004 on July 9, 2021."

Portal Hypertension & Cirrhosis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Chinese Medical Association.Aims: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common diseases worldwide. Reports of a high prevalence of CKD in NAFLD patients have been documented. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a reliable biomarker for renal dysfunction, and it is recommended for early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhotic patients. Currently, there is no evidence for using urine NGAL to predict CKD in NAFLD patients. We aim to determine the proportion of CKD and identify the predictive value of NGAL and other factors associated with CKD in these patients. Methods: A single-center, cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2018 and December 2019 in consecutive NAFLD patients diagnosed by transient elastography (TE) or liver biopsy at a tertiary care university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Advanced liver fibrosis is defined as fibrosis stages 3–4. The definition of CKD is estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml⋅min−1⋅1.73 m−2 based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline 2012. Urine NGAL level was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique. Results: A total of 101 NAFLD patients were included with a mean age of 54 ± 16 years. Among these patients, 14 (13.9%), 13 (12.9%), and 32 (31.7%) had fibrosis stages 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Nine percent (9 of 101) of patients with NAFLD with a mean eGFR of 42.66 ± 17.42 ml⋅min−1⋅1.73 m−2. The statistically significant factors associated with CKD were a higher level of urine NGAL (55.1 [25.15–150.60] vs. 15.1 [9.67–25.15] ng/ml; p = 0.006), a higher level of TE (17.3 [6.85–46.20] vs. 7.7 [5.6–11.7] kPa; p = 0.038), and a presence of advanced fibrosis (77.8% vs. 40.7%; p = 0.041), compared to those without CKD. Urine NGAL was the only significant factor associated with CKD in NAFLD patients. The cutoff level of urine NGAL at 36.75 ng/ml showed odds ratio of 21.27 (95% CI: 3.97–113.82; p < 0.001) and 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00–1.04; p = 0.024) by univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. The selected urine NGAL cutoff demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 85.9% for predicting CKD, respectively. Conclusions: The proportion of CKD in NAFLD patients was 9% and the presence of advanced fibrosis was a significant risk factor associated with CKD. Additionally, urine NGAL was significantly associated with CKD in NAFLD patients using a cutoff level of 36.75 ng/ml for predicting CKD with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. A larger prospective cohort study is needed to validate our findings."

Portal Hypertension & Cirrhosis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. on behalf of Chinese Medical Association.Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the leading cause of liver disease, and its prevalence is expected to increase in the future due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and an increasing aging population. With increases in longevity, NAFLD has emerged as a growing public health concern worldwide. NAFLD is a multisystem disease that has a strong association with metabolic risk factors. The presence of NAFLD increases the risks of liver- and cardiovascular-related mortality. Many studies have found age to be an additional risk factor for advanced fibrosis, which is associated with adverse outcomes. The identification of high-risk older persons using noninvasive methods is a key step in community management. Limitations in the diagnostic performance of current assessment methods have been encountered. This review provides an update on the new terminology that has changed from NAFLD to metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, noninvasive assessment, and prognosis of older persons with NAFLD."

The efficiency of adsorbents is critical to the success of this approach. Sugarcane bagasse fly ash (SBA) was used in this study as a support to increase the CO2 adsorption capacity of CaO. The physical and chemical characteristics of SBA treated with various reagents (HCl, H3PO4, CH3COOH, NaOH, NH3, and H2O2) were investigated. The CaO was then loaded at 10–50 wt% on the support surface, and the modified adsorbent was tested for its potential to adsorb CO2. According to the results of the experiments, the acidic reagent increased the surface area of SBA, whereas the base reagents provided SBA with a higher pore volume and a larger pore size. The different surface characteristics of the modified SBA had a direct impact on its CO2 adsorption capacity. The adsorbent with NaOH-pretreated SBA and 50% CaO loading had the highest CO2 adsorption capacity, which was 27% higher than that of unsupported CaO due to the decent distribution of CaO found on the NaOH-treated SBA surface. For a better understanding, a graphical model was finally proposed to describe the aforementioned changes in surface characteristics and adhesion of CaO on the SBA support. These findings show that SBA, a valueless bagasse-incinerating waste material, can be used as a support to increase the CO2 adsorption capacity of adsorbents, transforming it into a more valuable and environmentally sustainable material.Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"

It argues that the drafting of the NSM as Thailand's first refugee law resulted from policy entrepreneurship by officials in the Department of International Organizations (DIO), who promoted innovations in urban refugee management. The global refugee events of 2016 provided windows of opportunity for DIO officials to structure the need for creating the NSM and convince ruling generals to commit to new policy directions. However, bureaucrats in other agencies, who endorsed the status quo, leveraged their power to amend the initial conceptualization of the NSM and made it less progressive. Policy entrepreneurship offers another perspective for exploring changes in non-signatory states' refugee policies that can also be applied more broadly to the context of signatory countries."

All rights reserved.Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an important mosquito-borne virus. Previous studies have revealed the influence of midgut bacteria on infection with this pathogen. In this study, we examined the interactions of CHIKV with Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in terms of vector competence and the diversity of midgut bacteria. The diversity of midgut bacteria in CHIKV-infected and non-infected Ae. albopictus was observed after feeding with blood with different titers of CHIKV. CHIKV transmission rates on day 14 post-blood feeding in Ae. albopictus were 42%, 70%, 100%, 90% and 83% after being fed on 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106 TCID50/mL of CHIKV, respectively. Micrococcus was the dominant genus in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes fed at CHIKV titers of 102, 103, 105 and 106 TCID50/mL, but Bacillus was the dominant genus at 104 TCID50/mL. Non-infected mosquitoes differed from the CHIKV-infected mosquitoes fed at 103 and 105 TCID50/mL in that Staphylococcus was dominant. At the species level, Micrococcus luteus was the dominant species in Ae. albopictus fed on a CHIKV-negative blood meal, CHIKV non-infected mosquitoes fed on CHIKV at 102 TCID50/mL., and CHIKV-infected mosquitoes fed at CHIKV titers of 102, 103, 105 and 106 TCID50/mL."

All rights reserved.The aim of this study was to assess the effect of chronic melatonin treatment before calving in summer (long-day photoperiod, LDP, 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness) or winter (short-day photoperiod, SDP, 8 h of light and 16 h of darkness) on pregnancy rate after calving in lactating dairy cows. Before calving 60 cows were treated with melatonin and another 60 cows were not treated with melatonin thus functioning as a control group. In each group, 30 cows were treated during summer and 30 during winter. At 60 days after calving, all animals were submitted to a cosynch-ovsynch plus progesterone protocol and had fixed time artificial insemination (FTAI). The pregnancy rate at day 30 after FTAI was no different between groups (50% and 48% in treatment and in control groups, respectively, P = 0.66). Pregnancy losses during the first trimester of gestation (day 90 after FTAI) were 10% in cows treated with melatonin and 6% in the control group (P = 0.35). Considering the season of treatment there were no differences in either pregnancy rate (P = 0.70) or embryonic losses (P = 0.30) between the treatment and control groups. The results of this study indicate that in dairy cows submitted to a cosynch-ovsynch plus progesterone protocol and FTAI, the treatment with melatonin before calving did not compromise either pregnancy rate or embryo losses in both summer and winter."

This study assessed the effects of dietary supplementation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa FARP72 at 108 cells/g feed (PA diet) for 30 days on the innate immunity parameters, viz., respiratory oxidative burst (ROB) activity, lysozyme, ceruloplasmin, myeloperoxidase, in-vitro nitric oxide (NO) production in addition to the expression of immune genes encoding interleukin-1β, C3 and transferrin in yellowtail catfish Pangasius pangasius and their resistance to Edwardsiella tarda challenge at a sub-lethal dose of 1.50 × 107 cells/fish. A significant increase in the innate immunity parameters was noted in PA diet-fed catfish on 30 dpf compared to the control. Post E. tarda challenge, the levels of immune parameters increased significantly and peaked at 5 dpi irrespective of feeding to confer protection against E. tarda. Their levels, however, decreased on and from 10 dpi. The results on the expression of immune genes encoding interleukin-1β, C3 and transferrin in the kidney and liver tissue samples of PA diet-fed P. pangasius upon challenge with E. tarda further confirmed the ability of P. aeruginosa to stimulate primary immune organs at the gene level. The effects of feeding P. aeruginosa FARP72 on the immune functions of catfish as examined by the functional immune assays, thus, demonstrating the innate immune responses of catfish that are differentially stimulated by the PA diet. The findings of our study would help evolve management strategies to confer protection against E. tarda infection in commercial catfish aquaculture."

Our study aimed to describe the prevalence of DR-TB in Thai children between 2006 and 2021. Materials and methods: Children younger than 15 years old who had culture-confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB), positive PCR-MTB, or positive Xpert MTB/RIF were included in this cohort. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed using phenotypic and/or genotypic methods. The prevalence of DR-TB was compared using the chi-square test. Results: Among 163 confirmed TB cases (44% as pulmonary TB, 27% as extrapulmonary TB, and 29% with both), the median age (IQR) was 12.2 (7.3–14.2) years. DST was performed in 139 cases (85%), revealing prevalences of all DR-TB, isoniazid-resistant TB (Hr-TB), and rifampicin monoresistant/multidrug-resistant TB (Rr/MDR-TB) of 21.6% (95% CI 14.7–28.4), 10.8% (95% CI 5.6–16.0%), and 2.9% (95% CI 0.1–5.7%), respectively. The DR-TB rates did not differ significantly between 2006–2013, 2014–2018, and 2019–2021 (p > 0.05). Two pre-extensively DR-TB (pre-XDR) cases with fluoroquinolone resistance were detected after 2014. Conclusion: The prevalence of DR-TB in Thai children was stable. However, one-tenth of DR-TB cases confirmed with DST were Hr-TB, which required adjustment of the treatment regimen. The pre-XDR cases should be closely monitored."

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.We propose a hierarchical graph for learning physics and a novel way to handle obstacles. The finest level of the graph consist of the particles itself. Coarser levels consist of the cells of sparse grids with successively doubling cell sizes covering the volume occupied by the particles. The hierarchical structure allows for the information to propagate at great distance in a single message passing iteration. The novel obstacle handling allows the simulation to be obstacle aware without the need for ghost particles. We train the network to predict effective acceleration produced by multiple sub-steps of 3D multi-material material point method (MPM) simulation consisting of water, sand and snow with complex obstacles. Our network produces lower error, trains up to 7.0X faster and inferences up to 11.3X faster than [SGGP*20]. It is also, on average, about 3.7X faster compared to Taichi Elements simulation running on the same hardware in our tests."

Two experiments show that consumers in the goal attainment condition prefer a leader brand rather than a servant brand. In contrast, consumers in the goal progress condition show no difference in their preference for a leader brand or a servant brand. Mediation analyses show that the level of motivation mediates the effect of goal pursuit on consumers' preference for leader brands. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed."

This paper investigates the production of voicing and tones in a tonal Northern Kmhmu' dialect spoken in Nan Province, Thailand, and a non-tonal Eastern Kmhmu' dialect spoken in Vientiane, Laos, from both acoustic and electroglottographic perspectives. Large and consistent VOT differences between voiced and voiceless stops are preserved in Eastern Kmhmu', but are not found in Northern Kmhmu', consistent with previous reports. With respect to pitch, f0 is clearly a secondary property of the voicing contrast in Eastern Kmhmu', but unquestionably the primary contrastive property in Northern Kmhmu'. Crucially, no evidence is found to suggest that either phonation type or formant differences act as significant cues to voicing in Eastern Kmhmu' or tones in Northern Kmhmu'. These results suggests that voicing contrasts can also be transphonologized directly into f0-based contrasts, skipping a registral stage based primarily on phonation and/or vowel quality."

Long-term daily records of temperature and precipitation from six weather stations spread over the study area were analyzed. A total of 20 yearly indices were calculated and testified for the trends with the Mann-Kendal test and Sen's estimator of slope at a 95% confidence interval. Moreover, one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests were applied to verify the spatial heterogeneity of the climatic indices among the meteorological stations. Findings revealed that Khulna is the worst affected area with significant changes in 12 climatic indices. Jessore and Faridpur followed Khulna with significant changes in 10 and 9 indices, respectively. Among the indices, significant changes in TN10p (frequencies of daily minimum temperature event that falls below the 10th percentile value), TX10p (frequencies of daily maximum temperature event that falls beyond the 10th percentile value), CSDI (cold spell duration indicator), and CDD (consecutive dry day) are the most common phenomenon in the studied region. Five out of six stations have been experiencing significant increasing trends for TN10p. That indicates an overall increase of extreme cold day frequencies in the area. Khulna station showed shreds of evidence of extreme cold temperature instances with a statistically significant fall in the minimum value of the yearly minimum temperatures (TNn). Besides, Khulna also experienced a statistically significant fall in the minimum value of the yearly maximum temperatures. Consistently, the area showed a significant trend of wider cold spells. Similarly, the extremely warm day frequencies have also been increasing significantly for the Khulna, Jessore, and Faridpur areas. Therefore, it is evident that the studied area has been experiencing temperature extremes. On the other hand, precipitation extremes are apparent for only Khulna and Jessore. Both these stations showed increasing trends in heavy precipitation events and wet spells (consecutive precipitation days). ANOVA outcome suggests that the study area has significant spatial heterogeneity in climatic indices. Precipitation indices show high spatial heterogeneity than those of temperature. Among the meteorological stations, Mongla and Ishwardi show the maximum departure than those of others. This study may help policy-makers, researchers, and academicians to take proper initiatives to reduce the impacts of changing climatic parameters in the coastal areas of Bangladesh."

Calcium oxalate crystals can induce an inflammatory reaction that subsequently produces several proteins that have an inhibitory or stimulatory effect on stone formation. This study aimed to evaluate the differences in urinary proteomic profiles between hypercalciuric CaOx stone dogs and hypercalciuric stone-free dogs (CaOx stone and control groups, respectively). Materials and Methods: Seven dogs with hypercalciuric CaOx urolithiasis and breed-, sex-, and aged-matched controls with hypercalciuria were included in the study. Serum and urine samples were obtained from all dogs to analyze electrolytes. Urinary proteomic profiles were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Student’s t-test was used to compare the differences between groups. Results: Forty-nine urinary proteins were identified in the stone-free and CaOx stone groups, whereas 19 and 6 proteins were unique in the CaOx stone and stone-free groups, respectively. The urinary thrombomodulin level was significantly higher in the CaOx stone group (relative ratio = 1.8, p < 0.01) than in the stone-free group. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that urinary proteomic profiles may be used as a candidate biomarker for urinary tract injury in CaOx urolithiasis in dogs."

All rights reserved.Although alkali metal promoters have a considerable effect on the product distribution of CO2 hydrogenation over Fe-based catalysts, the mechanism of the active phase transformation is uncertain. The effects of Na modification and pretreatment atmosphere on phase evolution of Fe2O3 sample and the synergistic effect between iron oxides and carbides were investigated using in-situ X-ray diffraction (in-situ XRD). The physiochemical properties of catalyst were characterized by H2-TPR and CO+H2-TPSR-MS. When the reducing environment is H2, Na promoter inhibited the reduction of Fe2O3. However, when the reducing atmosphere is syngas (CO/H2 = 1:2), a suitable amount of Na promoter decreased the reduction and activation temperatures, and increased the iron carbide concentration. The selectivity of light olefins increased from 0.3% to 20.2%, and CO2 conversion increased from 7.3% to 25.8% when syngas was used as the reducing gas compared to using H2 as the reducing gas. Compared with pure Fe2O3, the CH4 selectivity of Na modified Fe2O3 decreased from 43.2% to 14.9%, while the selectivity of C5+ increased from 7.8% to 37.0%, owing to the fact that the Fe5C2 content increased from 8.5% to 38.4%. The ratio of Fe3O4 to Fe5C2 in the catalyst could be effectively controlled by changing the reducing atmosphere and the amount of Na promoter, thereby improving the CO2 hydrogenation activity and target product selectivity."

The primary goal was to investigate the incidence of delayed extubation after pediatric neurosurgery. The secondary goal was to identify the factors affecting delayed extubation in these patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was done in pediatric patients who underwent neurosurgery at a university hospital in a 5-year period from April 2015 to March 2020. Delayed extubation was that the patients who were not extubated at the end of procedure before leaving the operating room. Demographic data, preoperative and intraoperative factors associated with delayed extubation were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 539 pediatric patients were included in our study. There were 56 children in delayed extubation group with the incidence of 10.4%. In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with delayed extubation were including neonates (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.743; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.076-13.028), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III-IV (aOR, 3.010; 95% CI, 1.057-8.573), preoperative oxygen supplement (aOR, 6.033; 95% CI, 1.713-21.243), intracranial surgery (aOR, 4.494; 95% CI, 1.458-13.847), estimated blood loss (EBL) ≥ 40% of total blood volume (TBV) (aOR, 5.465; 95% CI, 1.640-18.210), and finishing operation after official hours (aOR, 3.810; 95% CI, 1.633-8.889). CONCLUSIONS: There were the preoperative and intraoperative factors associated with delayed extubation such as preoperative oxygen supplement, intracranial surgery, or EBL ≥ 40% of TBV.

All rights reserved.Speed climbing is the most dynamic discipline among all climbing sports that involves an optimization of the ascensional velocity. The result of competition depends on the time of climbing 15 m; therefore, all climbers try to improve their speed of climbing. The phases of climbing include the starting, second, third, and ending phases. The starting phase is the most importance phase, because the climbers should increase their speed from zero to the highest speed, which is seventy-five to one-hundred percent of the maximum climbing speed. There are two patterns for passing the starting phase, i.e., the classic start and the Tomoa skip. The classic start passes the starting phase by catching the 4th hand hold before catching the 5th hand hold, whereas the Tomoa skip does not. Thus, the Tomoa skip is an interesting starting pattern to improve maximum climbing speed, but there are few 3D analyses to show how the climber moves using that pattern. The purpose of this study was to perform a 3D analysis and compare the movement between the classic start and Tomoa skip during the starting phase of fifteen-meter speed climb. One Thai national rock climber was chosen to climb at an indoor speed climbing competition. Eight high-speed cameras were placed in front of and next to the rock wall. Fourteen retroreflective markers were placed on both sides of upper and lower extremities, spinous process of the 7th cervical vertebra, and center of harness. The climber was allowed to climb as fast as he could using 2 starting patterns, i.e., the classic start and Tomoa skip. The movement of the climber during the starting phase, especially from the 3rd to the 5th hand hold, was analyzed. The obtained results showed that the Tomoa skip starting pattern had shorter distance than the classic start; therefore, this pattern required less time but higher speed than the other pattern. In the Tomoa skip pattern, the climber moved by leaping from the 3rd to the 5th hand hold using the right leg to kick the hold vertically simultaneously with the right hand catching the 5th hand hold. On the other hand, in the classic start, the climber tilted the body to catch the 4th hand hold and then tilted back to the 5th hand hold. Therefore, using the Tomoa skip, the climber moves shorter distance at higher speed than in the classic start when moving in the vertically direction. Thus, the Tomoa skip start is the better pattern of starting than the classic start because it minimizes lateral displacement and leads to shorter distance and higher speed."

The methods are based on a classical exact, generalised pivotal quantity, a fiducial inference and a fiducial generalised pivotal quantity. The comparison of criteria involves the empirical coverage probability that maintains at the nominal confidence level of 0.95 and the shortest average length of the confidence interval. The simulation results show that the method based on the generalised pivotal quantity and the fiducial inference perform very well in terms of both the empirical coverage probability and the average length of the confidence interval. The classical exact method performs well in some situations, while the fiducial generalised pivotal quantity performs well in a very unbalanced design. Therefore, the method based on the generalised pivotal quantity is recommended for all situations."

In Thailand, dengue is endemic and is associated with a high socioeconomic burden. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess and describe the epidemiological and economic burden of dengue in Thailand. Methods Epidemiological and economic studies published in English and Thai between 2011–2019 and 2009–2019, respectively, were searched in MEDLINE, Embase, and Evidence-Based Medicines reviews databases. Reports published by the National Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and other grey literature sources were also reviewed. Identified studies were screened according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Extracted data were descriptively summarised and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results A total of 155 publications were included in the review (39 journal articles and 116 grey litera-ture). Overall, dengue incidence varied yearly, with the highest rates per 100,000 population in 2013 (dengue fever (DF) 136.6, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) 100.9, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) 3.58) and 2015 (DF 133.1, DHF 87.4, DSS 2.14). Peak incidence coin-cided with the monsoon season, and annual mortality was highest for DSS, particularly in the age group 15–24-year-olds. The highest dengue incidence rates were reported in children (10–14-year-olds) and young adults (15-24-year-olds), irrespective of dengue case definition. Economic and societal burdens are extensive, with the average cost per case ranging from USD 41 to USD 261, total cost per year estimated at USD 440.3 million, and an average of 7.6 workdays lost for DHF and 6.6 days for DF. Conclusions The epidemiological, economic, and societal burden of dengue in Thailand is high and underreported due to gaps in national surveillance data. The use of expansion factors (EFs) is recommended to understand the true incidence of dengue and cost-benefit of control measures. Furthermore, as dengue is often self-managed and underreported, lost school and workdays result in substantial underestimation of the true economic and societal burden of dengue. The implementation of integrated strategies, including vaccination, is critical to reduce the disease burden and may help alleviate health disparities and equity challenges posed by dengue."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background In animal models, prenatal zinc deficiency induced epigenetic changes in the fetus, but data in humans are lacking. We aimed to examine associations between maternal zinc levels during pregnancy and DNA methylation in LINE-1 and Alu repetitive sequences in young adult offspring, as well as anthropometry and cardiometabolic parameters. Methods Participants were 74 pregnant women from the Chiang Mai Low Birth Weight cohort, and their offspring followed up at 20 years of age. Maternal plasma zinc concentrations were measured at approximately 36 weeks of gestation. DNA methylation levels in LINE-1 and Alu repetitive sequences were measured in the offspring, as well as anthropometry and cardiometabolic parameters (lipid profile, blood pressure, and glucose metabolism). Results Over half of mothers (39/74; 53%) were zinc deficient (<50 μg/dL) during their third trimester of pregnancy. Maternal zinc concentrations during pregnancy were associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation levels in adult offspring. Specifically, lower prenatal zinc concentrations were associated with: 1) lower levels of total LINE-1 methylation; 2) lower levels of LINE-1 hypermethylation loci; and 3) higher levels of LINE-1 partial methylation loci. Prenatal zinc concentrations were not associated with Alu methylation levels, nor with any anthropometric or cardiometabolic parameters in adult offspring. However, we observed associations between Alu and LINE-1 methylation patterns and cardiometabolic outcomes in offspring, namely total cholesterol levels and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Conclusions Lower maternal zinc concentrations late in gestation were associated with changes in DNA methylation in later life. Thus, zinc deficiency during pregnancy may induce alterations in total LINE-1 methylation and LINE-1 hypermethylation loci. These results suggest a possible epigenetic link between zinc deficiency during pregnancy and long-term outcomes in the offspring."

An online questionnaire was distributed to obtain information on demographics, comorbidities, health behavior, symptoms, and treatment. The propensity technique was used to allocate the participants into the favipiravir and nonrecipient groups (1:1). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used for outcome measurement. The cohort was followed up biweekly for 60 days after onset/diagnosis to determine the occurrence of depression. Cox regression analysis with an adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the effect of favipiravir on post-COVID-19 depression. Results The data included the information of 712 participants, of whom 18.54% had depression within 60 days after onset/diagnosis. Depression was higher in the nonrecipient group (21.06%) than in the favipiravir group (16.01%). After adjustment by other factors, favipiravir prescription was found to be associated with depression (aOR 0.488, 95% CI 0.339–0.701 p < 0.001). In accordance with the PHQ-9 subset, favipiravir exerted a significant protective effect against depressive mood and loss of interest. However, patients living alone were prone to experiencing loss of interest (aOR 2.253, 95% CI 1.329–3.818, p = 0.003)."
['Geriatrics and Gerontology'],"Association of Phenotypic Aging Marker with comorbidities, frailty and inflammatory markers in people living with HIV  2022, The Author(s).Background: Aging characteristics in people living with HIV (PLWH) are heterogeneous, and the identification of risk factors associated with aging-related comorbidities such as neurocognitive impairment (NCI) and frailty is important. We evaluated predictors of novel aging markers, phenotypic age (PhenoAge) and phenotypic age acceleration (PAA) and their association with comorbidities, frailty, and NCI. Methods: In a cohort of PLWH and age- and sex-matched HIV-negative controls, we calculated PhenoAge using chronological age and 9 biomarkers from complete blood counts, inflammatory, metabolic-, liver- and kidney-related parameters. PAA was calculated as the difference between chronological age and PhenoAge. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with higher (>median) PAA. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was used to assess model discrimination for frailty. Results: Among 333 PLWH and 102 HIV-negative controls (38% female), the median phenotypic age (49.4 vs. 48.5 years, p = 0.54) and PAA (− 6.7 vs. -7.5, p = 0.24) was slightly higher and PAA slightly less in PLWH although this did not reach statistical significance. In multivariate analysis, male sex (adjusted odds ratio = 1.68 [95%CI = 1.03–2.73]), current smoking (2.74 [1.30–5.79]), diabetes mellitus (2.97 [1.48–5.99]), hypertension (1.67 [1.02–2.72]), frailty (3.82 [1.33–10.93]), and higher IL-6 levels (1.09 [1.04–1.15]), but not HIV status and NCI, were independently associated with higher PAA. PhenoAge marker discriminated frailty better than chronological age alone (AUROC: 0.75 [0.66–0.85] vs. 0.65 [0.55–0.77], p = 0.04). In the analysis restricted to PLWH, PhenoAge alone predicted frailty better than chronological age alone (AUROC: 0.7412 vs. 0.6499, P = 0.09) and VACS index (AUROC: 0.7412 vs. 0.6811, P = 0.34) despite not statistically significant. Conclusions: While PLWH did not appear to have accelerated aging in our cohort, the phenotypic aging marker was significantly associated with systemic inflammation, frailty, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. This simple aging marker could be useful to identify high-risk PLWH within a similar chronological age group."

The PHBV/ENR blends were mixed in 100/0, 90/10, 80/20, and 70/30 with PB-g-MA at 0, 5, and 10% (wt./wt.), using an internal mixer set to 175 °C with a rotor speed of 50 rpm. The findings indicated that at 70/30 PHBV/ENR composition, the impact strength of the blends with 25 and 50 epoxide contents were the greatest at 6.92 ± 0.35 J m−1 and 7.33 ± 1.19 J m−1, respectively, which are about two times greater than that of neat PHBV. Furthermore, the biodegradability of the PHBV/ENR blends was more substantial than that of neat PHBV, showing a mass reduction of approximately 40% and 45% for PHBV/ENR-25 and PHBV/ENR-50, respectively. In comparison, while the mass loss of PHBV was approximately 37% after three months of soil burial. The results indicate that ENR improves the toughness of the blends while simultaneously increasing PHBV degradation, which could pave the way for broadening PHBV for sustainability purposes."

All rights reserved.Brugada syndrome (BS) is an autosomal dominant inheritance cardiac arrhythmia disorder associated with sudden death in young adults. Thailand has the highest prevalence of BS world-wide, and over 60% of patients with BS still have unclear disease etiology. Here, we performed a new viral metagenome analysis pipeline called VIRIN and validated it with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of HeLa cell lines and hepatocellular carcinoma. Then the VIRIN pipeline was applied to identify viral integration positions from unmapped WGS data of Thai males, in-cluding 100 BS patients (case) and 100 controls. Even though the sample preparation had no viral enrichment step, we can identify several virus genes from our analysis pipeline. The pre-dominance of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) viruses was found in both cases and controls by blastn and blastx analysis. This study is the first report on the full-length HERV-K assembled genomes in the Thai population. Furthermore, the HERV-K integration breakpoint positions were validated and compared between the case and control datasets. Interestingly, Brugada cases contained HERV-K integration breakpoints at promoters five times more often than controls. Overall, the highlight of this study is the BS-specific HERV-K breakpoint positions that were found at the gene coding region ""NBPF11"" (n = 9), ""NBPF12"" (n = 8) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ""PCAT14"" (n = 4) region. The genes and the lncRNA have been re-ported to be associated with congenital heart and arterial diseases. These findings provide an-other aspect of the BS etiology associated with viral genome integrations within the human genome."

We aimed to explore the changes in AKI epidemiology between the first and the second COVID wave in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: This was an observational study of critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 in an expanded tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU) in London, UK. Baseline characteristics, organ support, COVID-19 treatments, and patient and kidney outcomes up to 90 days after discharge from hospital were compared. Results: A total of 772 patients were included in the final analysis (68% male, mean age 56 ± 13.6). Compared with wave 1, patients in wave 2 were older, had higher body mass index and clinical frailty score, but lower baseline serum creatinine and C-reactive protein (CRP). The proportion of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) on ICU admission was lower in wave 2 (61% vs 80%; p < 0.001). AKI incidence within 14 days of ICU admission was 76% in wave 1 and 51% in wave 2 (p < 0.001); in wave 1, 32% received KRT compared with 13% in wave 2 (p < 0.001). Patients in wave 2 had significantly lower daily cumulative fluid balance (FB) than in wave 1. Fewer patients were dialysis dependent at 90 days in wave 2 (1% vs. 4%; p < 0.001). Conclusions: In critically ill adult patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19, the risk of AKI and receipt of KRT significantly declined in the second wave. The trend was associated with less MV, lower PEEP and lower cumulative FB. Trial registration: NCT04445259."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Social mindfulness predicts concern for nature and immigrants across 36 nations  2022, The Author(s).People cooperate every day in ways that range from largescale contributions that mitigate climate change to simple actions such as leaving another individual with choice – known as social mindfulness. It is not yet clear whether and how these complex and more simple forms of cooperation relate. Prior work has found that countries with individuals who made more socially mindful choices were linked to a higher country environmental performance – a proxy for complex cooperation. Here we replicated this initial finding in 41 samples around the world, demonstrating the robustness of the association between social mindfulness and environmental performance, and substantially built on it to show this relationship extended to a wide range of complex cooperative indices, tied closely to many current societal issues. We found that greater social mindfulness expressed by an individual was related to living in countries with more social capital, more community participation and reduced prejudice towards immigrants. Our findings speak to the symbiotic relationship between simple and more complex forms of cooperation in societies."
['Medicine (all)'],"Genetic diagnosis for adult patients at a genetic clinic  2022 Rojnueangnit et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.Clinical utility of genetic testing has rapidly increased in the past decade to identify the definitive diagnosis, etiology, and specific management. The majority of patients receiving testing are children. There are several barriers for genetic tests in adult patients; barriers may arise from either patients or clinicians. Our study aims to realize the detection rate and the benefits of genetic tests in adults. We conducted a prospective study of 10 adult patients who were referred to a genetic clinic. Exome sequencing (ES) was pursued in all cases, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) was performed for six cases. Our result is impressive; six cases (60%) received likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants. Four definitive diagnosis cases had known pathogenic variants in KCNJ2, TGFBR1, SCN1A, and FBN1, whereas another two cases revealed novel likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants in GNB1 and DNAH9. Our study demonstrates the success in genetic diagnosis in adult patients: four cases with definitive, two cases with possible, and one case with partial diagnosis. The advantage of diagnosis is beyond obtaining the diagnosis itself, but also relieving any doubt for the patient regarding any previous questionable diagnosis, guide for management, and recurrence risk in their children or family members. Therefore, this supports the value of genetic testing in adult patients."

['Veterinary (all)'],"Impact of serum C-reactive protein level as a biomarker of cancer dissemination in canine lymphoid neoplasia Manachai, et al.Background and Aim: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a highly sensitive but non-specific acute phase protein that has been widely used to predict the biological behavior of patients with cancer. This study aimed to examine the significance of the serum CRP biomarker in predicting the prognosis of dogs with lymphoma. Materials and Methods: Blood samples (5 mL) were collected from 34 lymphoma dogs and control healthy dogs. Canine lymphoma clinical staging was classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. All lymphoma dogs were reclassified into two groups based on the disease stage. Stages IV and V were designated as advanced stages, and Stages I–III were designated as other stages. The serum CRP level was then determined using a commercial canine CRP fluorescent immunoassay kit and routine hematological and biochemical analyses. C-reactive protein levels, circulating inflammatory parameters, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and albumin levels were compared between advanced stages (IV and V) and Stages I to III using Mann–Whitney U tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also generated to determine the cutoff value, diagnostic sensitivity, and specificity of the CRP level. Results: A prospective study identified 34 dogs recently diagnosed with canine lymphoma. C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in lymphoma dogs in advanced stages (IV and V) than in lymphoma dogs in Stages I–III. According to the ROC curve analysis, a CRP cutoff level of 54.1 mg/L indicates advanced-stage canine lymphoma, which can be used as a biomarker to predict cancer dissemination. Conclusion: Serum CRP concentrations can assist clinical decision-making on the WHO stage in lymphoma dogs in clinical applications. The limitations of this study include a small number of lymphomas and no survival analysis."

Due to hot weather conditions, low-cost building materials, and a failure to consider the specific surrounding conditions of each case, thermal discomfort results. This study focuses on an improvement in the thermal comfort of a pilot CDC building in Maha Sarakham province, Thailand. Three CIBSE TM52 model criteria were applied to assess the level of overheating in the CDC building. The IESVE simulation tool was employed to assess the improvement from using passive design strategies (such as orientation, solar protection, thermal insulation, and ventilation). The results showed that passive design strategies could improve the overall thermal comfort of the CDC building. Thermal insulation, especially roof insulation, was the key element in reducing overheating in the building. A fully insulated building with shading devices and a night-time only window-opening pattern could meet the three targeted overheating criteria. Although the limitations of using the CIBSE TM52 model in hot and humid regions have been identified, these findings can be used as an exemplar of passive design strategy integration for other CDC buildings across the country."
['Veterinary (all)'],"The reversible effects of gossypol toxicity on male pigeons’ reproductive performance Wannaratana, et al.Background and Aim: Gossypol, a cotton seed derivative, is well known for its reversible antifertility in male reproduction across species. Its antifertility and reversibility effects on male reproductive function vary among species in dose-and time-dependent manners. In this study, the antifertility potential of gossypol in pigeons was evaluated for the first time to determine whether it might be used as a dietary supplement for pigeon population control. Materials and Methods: Male pigeons were assigned into three experimental groups: The gossypol-treated group (n = 12), the sham control group (n = 6), and the negative control group (n = 6). There were two experimental periods: A gossypol-feeding period of 28 days and a gossypol-free period of 28 days. During the gossypol-feeding period, birds in the gossypol-treated group were fed 4 mg of gossypol extract per day. Birds in the sham control group were fed 0.5 mL of mixed ethanol and sunflower oil, while those in the negative control group were fed 0.5 mL of phosphate buffer saline. After the gossypol-feeding phase was completed, all remaining pigeons in all groups continued to receive their regular diet for an additional 28 days (gossypol-free phase). The body weight and semen quality of the birds in the experimental groups were compared to evaluate gossypol’s antifertility effect. Results: In the gossypol-treated group as compared to the control groups, the percentages of sperm motility and viability were significantly lower at 21 days, and the percentage of normal sperm morphology was significantly lower at 28 days during the gossypol-feeding period. After gossypol withdrawal, these antifertility effects were resumed and reached a comparable semen quality to the control groups within 14 days. Conclusion: Gossypol supplementation (4 mg/day for 28 days) could lower male pigeons’ reproductive performance in terms of sperm motility, viability, and sperm morphology. Such infertility was, however, reversible within 14 days after gossypol withdrawal without any side effects on the pigeons, suggesting its application as a safe contraceptive feeding for male pigeons."

The sediment cores were collected from seven stations in the dry and wet seasons in 2022. The concentration of Pb, As, and Cd in the dry season were in the range 0.00–60.16, 0.00–6.68, and 0.00–0.92 mg/kg (dry weight), respectively. Meanwhile, the concentration of Pb, As, and Cd in the wet season were in the range 0.00–12.12, 0.00–3.86, and 0.00–0.92 mg/kg (dry weight), respectively. The vertical profiles of metal concentrations in core sediment show a general increase from bottom to top. Average concentrations of heavy metals in the sediments of the Khuan Khi Sian wetland are found to be lower than the sediment quality guideline. In the sediment cores, only As in the dry season exceeded the U.S. EPA standard. The calculated enrichment factor (EF) and the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) indicate that the sediments were moderately polluted with As in some locations. According to the Ri analysis, Pb was low risk but the criteria of ecological risk of As and Cd are considerable and they are considered high risk. This is potentially due to agricultural activities and land use around the wetland areas and municipalities. The concentration of As and Cd should be of concern and subject to regular monitoring."

The results showed that hBMSCs underwent robust chondrogenesis and facilitated in vivo cartilage regeneration. However, it was noticed that the GH scaffolds display a compressive modulus that is markedly lower than native cartilage. In this study, we aimed to enhance the mechanical strength of GH scaffolds without significantly impairing their chondrosupportive property. Specifically, polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and photoinitiators were infiltrated into pre-formed hBMSC-laden GH scaffolds and then photo-crosslinked. Results showed that infiltration of PEG at the beginning of chondrogenesis significantly increased the deposition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the central area of the scaffold. To explore the mechanism, we compared the cell migration and proliferation in the margin and central areas of GH and PEG-infiltrated GH scaffolds (GH+PEG). Limited cell migration was noticed in both groups, but more proliferating cells were observed in GH than in GH+PEG. Lastly, the in vitro repairing study with bovine cartilage explants showed that PEG- impregnated scaffolds integrated well with host tissues. These results indicate that PEG-GH hybrid scaffolds, created through infiltrating PEG into pre-formed GH scaffolds, display good integration capacity and represent a new tool for the repair of chondral injury."

The effect of the boron incorporation into the Ni-W alloy coating and subsequent heat treatment of the deposits on the microstructure and properties of the Ni-W/boron coatings have been investigated. The boron particles can be uniformly dispersed in the Ni-W alloy, which can lead to an enhancement in the wear performance and hardness of the coatings. The XRD results show that a new Ni4W phase can be formed, especially at heat treatment temperatures beyond 400 °C. The grain size of the deposits is smaller than 10 nm with heat treatment temperatures lower than 600 °C and increases with the heat treatment temperature increasing. The higher temperature will significantly cause the grain coarsening (25.8 nm at 700 °C). Furthermore, the hardness and wear resistance increase with the formation of the Ni4W phase and the inverse Hall–Petch relationship at the lower heat treatment temperatures (<600 °C). While the grain coarsening causes the hardness of the deposits to decrease at the temperature of 700 °C."

However, its poor solubility and permeability limit its clinical efficacy. To overcome its physicochemical and pharmacokinetic limitations, we statistically designed a mucoadhesive chitosan–alginate nanoparticles (MCS-ALG-NPs) as a new carrier for FVR using response surface methodology, which provided suitable characteristics for transmucosal delivery. The use of mucoadhesive polymers for intranasal administration promotes the residence time and contact of FVR in the mucus membrane. The optimized FVR-MCS-ALG-NPs demonstrated superior mucoadhesion, higher permeation and deposition in the nasal mucosa, and a significant increase in the inhibition of viral replication over 35-fold compared with free FVR. The overall results suggest that MCS-ALG-NPs could be used as an effective mucoadhesive carrier to enhance the activity of FVR against COVID-19."

The gelatinization of Ca2+-pectin was examined at concentrations of 0.9, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.6 M of Ca2+ in aqueous pectin solutions of 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%. The gel transition of Ca2+-pectin solution to hydrogels was determined by measuring the storage modulus (G’) and loss modulus (G”) under mechanical strain from 0.01 to 100%. In a hydrogel of 3% pectin at Ca2+ = 2.4 M, as pH increased to 7, the G’ at 0.01 strain % was 3 × 104 Pa, and 3 × 103 Pa at pH 5, indicating that the crosslinking weakened at acidic pH. Due to the crosslinking between the calcium ions and the ionized carboxylic acid groups of pectin, the resulting hydrogel became stiff. When the mechanical strain % was in the range of 0.01–1%, G’ was unchanged and G” was an order of magnitude smaller than G’, indicating that the mechanical stress was relieved by the gel. In the range of 1–100%, the gel deformation progressed and both the moduli values were dropped. Collapse from the gel state to the solution state occurred at 1–10 strain %, but the softer hydrogels with G’ of 103 Pa had a larger strain % than the stiffer hydrogels with G’ of 104 Pa."

Botanical insecticide is an alternative solution for controlling these insects, and long pepper (Piper retrofractum) has been reported as having insecticidal potential against general insect pests. Film seed coatings with various concentrations of hexane extracts were made for mung bean (Vigna radiata) and corn (Zea mays) seeds. Insecticidal activities of these treatments were assessed at before and after storage period of six months, and seed germination was also evaluated. The hexane extract was subjected to analysis of the bioactive components by using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Results revealed that the hexane extract presented extreme toxicity to both bruchid beetles higher compared to maize weevil at 24 h with LC50 values of 5.57–6.75 and 58.04 μg⋅cm−2, respectively. Bruchid beetles presented significant response to ethanol, acetone and hexane extracts, whereas maize weevil showed relatively low responsibility. Film seed coating with hexane extract at 1% and 3% concentrations with six-month storage presented high insecticidal activity against bruchid beetles by more than 88% mortality but had low kill rates against maize weevil. The coated mung bean seeds presented non-seed germination effect, whereas high effect was observed on coated corn. Isolation of bioactive components demonstrated that there were 74 compounds, where pentadecane was the main compound. Film seed coating technology for mung bean seed preservation by using 1% hexane extract from long pepper fruit presented to be an extremely effective method to control bruchid beetles without any seed germination effect. It could serve as one of the green insecticides of the future."

The data analysis was performed by univariable analysis at P<0.1 without correlation with other variables more than 30% and multivariable analysis was performed simultaneously. Variables associated with daily milk yield were examined for interaction at P<0.05. The predictability of the equation was examined. 305 days of milk production was simulated by using Monte-Carlo technique. The 856 data sets from 184 cows were recorded for daily milk yield and LS. The non-lameness, subclinical and clinical lameness groups were 49.6, 43.7 and 6.7%, respectively. The average of 305 days milk yield of the non-lameness group in unit 1 and 2 was 6,426.9 ± 1,544.8 and 4,651.6 ± 1,420.1 kg, respectively. The simulation data showed a decrease in 305 days of milk yield (1,266.2 ± 467.5 kg) in cows where lameness occurred throughout the 1st lactation when compared with a healthy cow. The clinical and subclinical lameness in the first three months of the lactation period reduced the daily milk yield by 1.2 ± 0.5 and 0.2 ± 0.6 kg, respectively. In addition, the occurrence of clinical and subclinical lameness with clinical mastitis reduced the daily milk yield by 1.6 ± 0.9 and 0.5 ± 1.0 kg, respectively. This study showed evidence of milk loss caused by lameness. This can motivate farmers to take action on lameness and preventive measures should be planned to reduce the production loss in the farm."

They were identified as Companilactobacillus formosensis (Group I, 10 isolates), Lentilactobacillus buchneri (Group II, 8 isolates), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum (Group III, 16 isolates), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (Group IV, 1 isolate), Pediococcus pentosaceus (Group V, 5 isolates) and P. acidilactici (Group V, 1 isolate), Enterococcus thailandicus (Group VI, 2 isolates), En. hirae (Group VII, 1 isolate), En. durans (Group VI, 1 isolate), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (Group VII, 1 isolate), Lc. lactis subsp. hordinae (Group VII, 1 isolate), and Leuconostoc lactis (Group VIII, 1 isolate), based on their phenotypic and genetic characteristics. Seven isolates, L. plantarum subsp. plantarum LM6-1, LM6-2, LM7-2-2B, LM12-1, LM14-1, LM15-1P and LM15-2 expressed bile salt hydrolase activity. All isolates assimilated cholesterol ranging from 20.73 to 79.40%. BSH-producing isolates were tolerant to acidic and bile conditions and showed the adhesion ability to Caco-2 cells. The BSH-producing and selected isolates showed the immunomodulatory effects to stimulate interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), human beta defensin-2 (hBD-2) and nitric oxide (NO) production at various levels. Therefore, these results indicated that the isolates meet the standard probiotic criteria and beneficial effects."

Leaf Extract as Bioactive Substances for Anti-Androgen and Antioxidant Activities  2022 by the authors.Leaves of guava (Psidium guajava L.) have been used in Thai folk medicine without any supporting evidence as a traditional herbal remedy for hair loss. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is chronic hair loss caused by effects of androgens in those with a genetic predisposition, resulting in hair follicle miniaturization. Our objectives were to provide the mechanistic assessment of guava leaf extract on gene expressions related to the androgen pathway in well-known in vitro models, hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC), and human prostate cancer cells (DU-145), and to determine its bioactive constituents and antioxidant activities. LC-MS analysis demonstrated that the main components of the ethanolic extract of guava leaves are phenolic substances, specifically catechin, gallic acid, and quercetin, which contribute to its scavenging and metal chelating abilities. The guava leaf extract substantially downregulated SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3 genes in the DU-145 model, suggesting that the extract could minimize hair loss by inhibiting the synthesis of a potent androgen (dihydrotestosterone). SRD5A suppression by gallic acid and quercetin was verified. Our study reveals new perspectives on guava leaf extract’s anti-androgen properties. This extract could be developed as alternative products or therapeutic adjuvants for the treatment of AGA and other androgen-related disorders."

All aggregation operators that are derived based on Hamacher norms are very powerful and are beneficial because of the parameter (Formula presented.). Choquet first posited the theory of the Choquet integral (CI) in 1953, which is used for evaluating awkward and unreliable information to address real-life problems. In this manuscript, we analyze several aggregation operators based on CI, aggregation operators, the Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm, and Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy (A-IF) information. These are called A-IF Hamacher CI averaging (A-IFHCIA), A-IF Hamacher CI ordered averaging (A-IFHCIOA), A-IF Hamacher CI geometric (A-IFHCIG), and A-IF Hamacher CI ordered geometric (A-IFHCIOG) operators; herein, we identify their most beneficial and valuable results according to their main properties. Working continuously, we developed a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) procedure for evaluating awkward and unreliable information, with the help of the TOPSIS technique for order performance by similarity to the ideal solution, and derive operators to enhance the worth and value of the present information. Finally, by comparing the pioneering information with some of the existing operators, we illustrate some examples for evaluating the real-life problems related to enterprises, wherein the owner of a company appointed four senior board members of the enterprise to decide what was the best Asian company in which to invest money, to show the supremacy and superiority of the invented approaches."
"['Instrumentation', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Control and Optimization']","IPChain: Blockchain-Based Security Protocol for IoT Address Management Servers in Smart Homes  2022 by the authors.The dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) servers are forms of an Internet of Things (IoT) address management server (IoTAMS) that gives network configuration settings to newly connected hosts. Administrators of a network may save time by setting DHCP servers instead of every network node. However, the absence of a more robust authentication method for DHCP servers makes hosts susceptible to attacks since neither the server nor the users are able to check the other’s authenticity during DHCP connections. These concerns result in both internal and external threats to the system that have the potential to impair network services. Among these threats are malicious DHCP servers and DHCP starvation. This paper aims to provide a novel approach for tackling these issues and protect the DHCP protocol. The proposed model uses the Diffie–Hellman key exchange mechanism, the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP), a one-way hash function, blockchain technology, and a smart contract. In addition, registration and validation processes provide support for the proposed model in combating DHCP risks for both internal and external system threats. Results from this study show that the proposed model has an average of 21.1% more resistance to a growing number of adversaries than the benchmark models, thus revealing that the model is better suited for the security of IoT address management servers in smart homes, thereby enhancing resilience against related threats and the success of IP address management."

Shrimp with WFS usually show a reduced feed consumption and growth rate, hepatopancreatic discoloration, and loose shells. Recently, WFS has been said to be related to an infection with Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), a microsporidian parasite, and other opportunistic bacteria, such as the Vibrio species. Vibrio spp. may play an important role in WFS occurrence; nevertheless, Vibrio sp., as a single pathogen, cannot reproduce this syndrome under laboratory conditions. To date, no novel treatment has been found for WFS; therefore, preventive measures, such as strict biosecurity systems to eliminate or inactivate EHP spores and limit the total Vibrio number, have been suggested. This review summarizes the information regarding the association between WFS and water parameters, gut microbiomes, EHP and Vibrio, and disease control strategies."

The grasping kinetics was analyzed. The connection between grasping quality and SPA performance is discussed. We also devised a subjective definition of grasping quality due to SPA performance. A modeling technique was established, which makes dominant factors of grasping quality due to the SPA performance predictable over the gripper input. Later, a control architecture was developed. This architecture demonstrates how the grasping is implemented. The modeling technique was used to forecast grasping quality due to the SPA performance and its factors. An experiment was conducted to obtain actual results. The predicted and actual results were correspondingly compared. The results show minute deviation, thereby validating the reliability of the grasping. This study clarifies the association between grasping quality and SPA performance and contributes an advancement toward modellable and controllable task-level variables, such as grasping quality, in SPG pincer grasping."

We investigated immunogenicity induced by different primary prime-boost vaccination protocols and the subsequent response to the booster vaccine among LT recipients. Methods: LT recipients, who received primary immunisation with ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 or ChAdOx1/BNT162b2, were administered the third dose of mRNA-1273 three months following the primary vaccination. Blood samples were collected before and after primary vaccination and post-booster. The levels of receptor binding domain antibody (anti-RBD) and neutralising antibody (sVNT) and spike-specific T-cell responses were assessed. Results: Among the 89 LT recipients, patients receiving ChAdOx1/BNT162b2 had significantly higher anti-RBD titres, sVNT, and cellular response after primary vaccination than those receiving ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 (p < 0.05). The antibody response decreased 12 weeks after the primary vaccination. After the booster, humoral and cellular responses significantly improved, with comparable seroconversion rates between the heterologous and homologous groups. Positive sVNT against the wild type occurred in >90% of LT patients, with only 12.3% positive against the Omicron variant. Conclusions: ChAdOx1/BNT162b2 evoked a significantly higher immunological response than ChAdOx1/ChAdOx1 in LT recipients. The booster strategy substantially induced robust immunity against wild type in most patients but was less effective against the Omicron strain."

Despite the significant research efforts employed for tumor prevention, cervical cancer ranks as the leading cause of cancer death. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important risk factor for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a preventable disease, for which early detection could increase survival rates. Immunotherapies represent a promising approach in the treatment of cancer, and several potential candidates are in clinical trials, while some are available in the market. However, equal access to available HPV vaccines is limited due to their high cost, which remains a global challenge for cervical cancer prevention. The implementation of screening programs, disease control systems, and medical advancement in developed countries reduce the serious complications associated with the disease somewhat; however, the incidence and prevalence of cervical cancer in low-income and middle-income countries continues to gradually increase, making it the leading cause of mortality, largely due to the unaffordable and inaccessible anti-cancer therapeutic options. In recent years, plants have been considered as a cost-effective production system for the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and other biopharmaceuticals. Several proof-of-concept studies showed the possibility of producing recombinant biopharmaceuticals for cancer immunotherapy in a plant platform. This review summarizes the current knowledge and therapeutic options for the prevention of cervical cancer and discusses the potential of the plant expression platform to produce affordable HPV vaccines."

Most antifungal agents have low aqueous solubility, which may hamper their bioavailability. Their complexation with cyclodextrins (CDs) could increase the solubility of antifungals, facilitating their antifungal efficacy. Nanoparticulate systems are promising carriers for antifungal delivery due to their ability to overcome the drawbacks of conventional dosage forms. CD-based nanocarriers could form beneficial combinations of CDs and nanoparticulate platforms. These systems have synergistic or additive effects regarding improved drug loading, enhanced chemical stability, and enhanced drug permeation through membranes, thereby increasing the bioavailability of drugs. Here, an application of CD in antifungal drug formulations is reviewed. CD-based nanocarriers, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, nanofibers, and in situ gels, enhancing antifungal activity in a controlled-release manner and possessing good toxicological profiles, are described. Additionally, the examples of current, updated CD-based nanocarriers loaded with antifungal drugs for delivery by various routes of administration are discussed and summarized."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). ReceivedChemical fungicides are widely used in the agriculture sector and cause severe environmental problems. Biological control, a method using antagonistic organisms, has been considered one of the most promising strategies to tackle this issue. Actinomycetes, particularly Streptomyces strains, produced diverse classes of bioactive secondary metabolites. In this study, four Streptomyces strains, DR5-1, DR7-3, DR8-5, and DR8-8, isolated from three Dendrobium species (Orchidaceae), exhibited significant antifungal activity against five phytopathogenic fungi, particularly with high potency against Curvularia oryzae. The bacterial identification was performed based on phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, including the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Strain DR7-3 from the roots of Dendrobium findlayanum exhibited high antifungal activity, and its culture filtrate caused damage to the cell structure of C. oryzae SA04. It was identified as Streptomyces solisilvae based on the average nucleotide identity, ANIb (98.49%), and DNA–DNA hybridization value (88.40%). The EtOAc extract from strain DR7-3 was analyzed by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Among the 15 identified compounds, eicosane, phenol-2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl), hexadecane, and hexadecanoic acid-methyl ester showed significant antifungal activity. The draft genome sequence analysis of strain DR7-3 revealed 72 putative biosynthetic gene clusters of secondary metabolites. The genome alignment indicated that 13 gene clusters are involved in the biosynthesis of these antifungal metabolites. These results suggested that strain DR7-3 could be a promising candidate for developing new and safe microbial biological control agents for application in agricultural fields."

In addition, we assessed the risk factors associated with severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)-related morbidity and mortality. Methods: The data were reviewed retrospectively from the National Health Security Office for hospitalized children younger than 18 years old diagnosed with RSV-related LRTI in Thailand, between the fiscal years of 2015 to 2020. The RSV-related LRTIs were identified using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Thai Modification. ICD-10-TM codes J12.1, J20.5, and J21.0, which represent respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, acute bronchitis due to respiratory syncytial virus, and acute bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus, respectively, were studied. Results: During the study period, RSV-related LRTI accounted for 19,340 of the 1,610,160 hospital admissions due to LRTI. RSV pneumonia was the leading cause of hospitalization (13,684/19,340; 70.76%), followed by bronchiolitis (2849/19,340; 14.73%) and bronchitis (2807/19,340; 14.51%), respectively. The highest peak incidence of 73.55 percent occurred during Thailand’s rainy season, from August to October. The mortality rate of RSV-related LRTI in infants younger than 1 year of age was 1.75 per 100,000 person years, which was significantly higher than that of children 1 to younger than 5 years old and children 5 to younger than 18 years old (0.21 per 100,000 person years and 0.01 per 100,000 person years, respectively, p-value < 0.001). Factors associated with mortality were congenital heart disease, hematologic malignancy, malnutrition, and neurological disease. Conclusions: In children with RSV LRTI, pneumonia was the leading cause of hospitalization. The admission rate was highest during the rainy season. Mortality from RSV-related LRTI was higher in children under 1 year old and in children with underlying illnesses; future preventive interventions should target these groups of patients."

While dengue virus (DENV) infection tends to occur year-round with an upsurge in the rainy season, Zika virus (ZIKV) also circulates in the country. The overlap in the distribution of these viruses increased the probability of co-infections during the heightened CHIKV activity. By examining 1806 patient serum samples submitted for CHIKV diagnostics from October 2018-February 2020 (511 CHIKV-negatives and 1295 CHIKV-positives), we used real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to identify DENV and ZIKV individually. A total of 29 ZIKV and 36 DENV single-infections were identified. Interestingly, 13 co-infection cases were observed, of which 8 were CHIKV/DENV, 3 were CHIKV/ZIKV, and 2 were DENV/ZIKV. There were six DENV genotypes (13 DENV-1 genotype I, 10 DENV-2 Asian I, 10 DENV-2 Cosmopolitan, 6 DENV-3 genotype I, 2 DENV-3 genotype III, and 5 DENV-4 genotype I). Additionally, ZIKV strains identified in this study either clustered with strains previously circulating in Thailand and Singapore, or with strains previously reported in China, French Polynesia, and the Americas.

In the present study, we examined the difference in salinity effect on the survival rate, wet weight (hereafter weight) change, behaviour, and osmolality of these two Pontodrilus species. A 28 d exposure to varying salinity concentration (0–50 ppt) revealed that P. litoralis is able to survive over a wide salinity range than P. longissimus, with the latter species exhibiting a low survival rate over the same salinity range. During short-term exposure (0–96 h) to a salinity of less than 30 ppt, P. litoralis exhibited weight gain and this was significant in the first 12 h of exposure. However, P. longissimus gained weight when exposed to salinity at under 10 ppt in the first 72 h of exposure. The two species of Pontodrilus behaved differently when exposed to different salinities. The coelomic fluid osmolarity of Pontodrilus was related to the exposure medium and was mostly maintained as hyperosmotic to the external medium over the range of salinities tested. This study shows how two different species of the littoral earthworm genus Pontodrilus respond to a change in salinity, which may explain their dispersal pattern and shape their distribution pattern throughout Southeast Asia."

In this study, chitosan (Ch)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Ch-IONPs) were fabricated and optimized using Box–Behnken design-based response surface methodology for delivery of CUR-2GE. Ch was used as a coating material on the nanoparticle surface to avoid aggregation. The optimized condition for preparing Ch-IONPs consisted of using 4 mg Ch fabricated at pH 11 under a reaction temperature of 85 °C. The optimized Ch-IONPs were successfully loaded with CUR-2GE with sufficient loading capacity (1.72 ± 0.01%) and encapsulation efficiency (94.9 ± 0.8%). The obtained CUR-2GE-loaded Ch-IONPs (CUR-2GE-Ch-IONPs) exhibited desirable characteristics including a particle size of less than 50 nm based on TEM images, superparamagnetic property, highly crystalline IONP core, sufficient stability, and sustained-release profile. In the presence of permanent magnets, CUR-2GE-Ch-IONPs significantly increased cellular uptake and cytotoxicity toward MDA-MB-231 with a 12-fold increase in potency compared to free CUR-2GE, indicating the potential of magnetic-field assisted delivery of CUR-2GE-Ch-IONPs for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer."

The rPP can be added at up to 40 wt% into the PP matrix without significantly affecting the mechanical properties. MFI of blended PP increased with increasing rPP content. Modulus and tensile strength of PP slightly decreased with increased rPP content, while the elongation at break increased to up to 30.68% with a 40 wt% increase in rPP content. This is probably caused by the interfacial adhesion of PP and rPP during the blending process. The electrical conductivity of materials was improved by adding carbon black into the rPP matrices. It has a significant effect on the mechanical and electrical properties of the composites. Stress-strain curves of composites changed from ductile to brittle behaviors. This could be caused by the poor interfacial interaction between rPP and carbon black. FTIR spectra indicate that carbon black did not have any chemical reactions with the PP chains. The obtained composites exhibited good performance in the electrical properties tested. Finally, DSC results showed that rPP and carbon black could act as nucleating agents and thus increase the degree of crystallinity of PP."

We report multiple presentations of leishmaniasis in a 47-year-old patient with HIV/AIDS from Chiang Rai Province, northern Thailand. Physical examination showed multiple ulcerated papules, nodules, and plaques in a sporotrichoid distribution. Firm mucosal nodules on the hard palate and nasal opening, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy were found. Histopathological examination of the biopsies revealed an inflammatory infiltrate containing intramacrophage amastigotes compatible with Leishmania infection. In addition, Leishmania promastigotes were isolated successfully from the palatal biopsy and assigned the code MHOM/TH/2022/CULE6. Using internal transcribed spacer 1 polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, the causative parasite was identified as Leishmania martiniquensis. A definitive diagnosis of multiform leishmaniasis with disseminated cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral involvement was established. The patient was administered intravenous amphotericin B 1 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks, followed by oral itraconazole 400 mg daily. At the 2-month follow-up, the cutaneous and mucosal lesions had improved significantly. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mucocutaneous involvement caused by L. martiniquensis in an immunocompromised patient with HIV/AIDS. In addition, we provide a literature review of leishmaniasis cases, reported formally in Thailand, resulting from this autochthonous parasite."

New potent chemotherapeutic agents targeting apoptosis-deregulating molecules have been discovered. In this study, 22-(4-pyridinecarbonyl) jorunnamycin A (22-(4′py)-JA), a synthetic derivative of bistetrahydroisoquinolinequinone from the Thai blue sponge, was semisynthesized by the Steglich esterification method, and its pharmacological mechanism in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was elucidated by a network pharmacology approach. All predicted targets of 22-(4′py)-JA and genes related to NSCLC were retrieved from drug-target and gene databases. A total of 78 core targets were identified, and their associations were analyzed by STRING and Cytoscape. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that molecules in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling were potential targets of 22-(4′py)-JA in the induction of NSCLC apoptosis. In silico molecular docking analysis displayed a possible interaction of ERK1/2 and MEK1 with 22-(4′py)-JA. In vitro anticancer activity showed that 22-(4′py)-JA has strong cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects in H460, H292 and A549 NSCLC cells. Furthermore, immunoblotting confirmed that 22-(4′py)-JA induced apoptotic cell death in an ERK/MEK/Bcl-2-dependent manner. The present study demonstrated that 22-(4′py)-JA exhibited a potent anticancer effect that could be further developed for clinical application and showed that network pharmacology approaches are a powerful tool to illustrate the molecular pathways of new drugs or compounds."

The advanced EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) triple mutation has been recently reported, and there have been no specific drugs approved for this strain. Therefore, our research aimed to search for effective agents that could impede the function of EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK by the integration of in silico and in vitro approaches. Our in-house quinoxalinone-containing compounds were screened through molecular docking and their biological activity was then verified by enzyme- and cell-based assay. We found that the four quinoxalinone-containing compounds including CPD4, CPD15, CPD16, and CPD21 were promising to be novel EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK inhibitors. The IC50 values measured by the enzyme-based assay were 3.04 ± 1.24 nM; 6.50 ± 3.02 nM,10.50 ± 1.10 nM; and 3.81 ± 1.80 nM, respectively, which are at a similar level to a reference drug; osimertinib (8.93 ± 3.01 nM). Besides that, they displayed cytotoxic effects on a lung cancer cell line (H1975) with IC50 values in the range of 3.47 to 79.43 μM. In this proposed study, we found that all screened compounds could interact with M793 at the hinge regions and two mutated residues including M790 and S797; which may be the main reason supporting the inhibitory activity in vitro. The structural dynamics revealed that the screened compounds have sufficient non-native contacts with surrounding amino acids and could be well-buried in the binding site’s cleft. In addition, all predicted physicochemical parameters were favorable to be drug-like based on Lipinski’s rule of five, and no extreme violation of toxicity features was found. Altogether, this study proposes a novel EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK inhibitor scaffold and provides a detailed understanding of compounds’ recognition and susceptibility at the molecular level."
"['Pollution', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","Phytoextraction Potential of Sunn Hemp, Sunflower, and Marigold for Carbaryl Contamination: Hydroponic Experiment  2022 by the authors.The phytoextraction ability and responses of sunn hemp, sunflower, and marigold plants were investigated toward carbaryl insecticide at 10 mg L−1 and its degradative product (1-naphthol). All test plants exhibited significant carbaryl removal capability (65–93%) with different mechanisms. Marigold had the highest translocation factor, with carbaryl taken up, translocated and accumulated in the shoots, where it was biotransformed into 1-naphthol. Consequently, marigold had the least observable toxicity symptoms caused by carbaryl and the highest bioconcentration factor (1848), indicating its hyperaccumulating capability. Sunflower responded to carbaryl exposure differently, with the highest carbaryl accumulation (8.7 mg kg−1) in roots within 4 days of cultivation, leading to a partial toxicity effect. Sunn hemp exhibited severe toxicity, having the highest carbaryl accumulation (91.7 mg kg−1) that was biotransformed to 1-naphthol in the sunn hemp shoots. In addition, the different models were discussed on plant hormone formation in response to carbaryl exposure."

"['Food Science', 'Nutrition and Dietetics']","The Role of Food Literacy in Managing Nutritional Precarity in the Migrant Experience: Dietary Lifestyles of Cambodia Migrants in Thailand  2022 by the authors.The paper explores the dietary lifestyles of young Cambodian migrants in Thailand to illuminate the role of food literacy in determining nutritional outcomes and well-being, including during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, food literacy is defined as food skills and abilities to plan, select, and prepare to achieve adequate consumption under new or adverse social and culinary contexts of the migrant experience. In this paper, we consider both how nutritional precarity arises in the migrant experience, and to what extent food literacy can mitigate it under various conditions. The research approach involves a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches that were adjusted to address the limited mobility for social science research during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. Data collection was conducted through hybrid (online and in-person) ethnography, focus group discussions, food literacy questionnaires, and key informant interviews, often facilitated through internet messaging clients. The findings indicate that, while generally high food literacy may facilitate the transition to the foreign food systems found in migration destinations, optimizing nutrition and well-being requires reinforcement by context-specific food literacy, such as openness to foreign flavors and recipes. Contextual food literacy most directly leads to positive social and health outcomes while simultaneously expanding universal food literacy in the long-term."
"['Infectious Diseases', 'Virology']","High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Detection via Cobas® 4800 and REBA HPV-ID® Assays  2022 by the authors.Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs), particularly HPV16 and 18, has long been known to induce cervical cancer progression. However, given that a minority of HPV-infected women develop cancer, analysis of HR-HPV-infected women could help to predict who is at risk of acquiring cervical cancer. Therefore, to improve HR-HPVs detection, we used the FDA-approved cobas® 4800 HPV and REBA HPV-ID® HPV assays to detect HR-HPVs in colposcopy-derived cervical cells from 303 patients, detecting 72.28% (219) and 71.62% (217) of HR-HPVs positive cases, with HPV16 detection rates of 35.64% (108) and 30.69% (93), respectively. Of the HPV16-positive cases, cobas® 4800 and REBA HPV-ID® identified 28.81% (51) and 25.42% (45) of the CIN1 cases, and 55% (33) and 50% (30) of the 60 CIN2/3 cases, respectively. HPV-diagnostic concordance was 82.17% overall (kappa = 0.488), 87.45% for HR-HPVs (kappa = 0.689), and 88.33% for CIN2/3 (kappa = 0.51). The HR-HPVs detection rates of these assays were comparable. Our findings reveal that the FDA-approved HR-HPVs detection assay is appropriate for screening women with HR-HPVs infection, and for predicting increased risk of cervical cancer progression. REBA HPV-ID® can be used to detect low risk-HPV types in high-grade cervical lesions that are HR-HPV negative as well as in the distribution of HPV types."

In this study, the semisynthesis of 28 furofuran lignans using samin (5) as the starting material is described. Our methodology involved the protonation of samin (5) to generate an oxocarbenium ion followed by the attack from two different nucleophiles, namely, thiols (RSH) and alcohols (ROH). The highly diastereoselective thioether and ether furofuran lignans were obtained, and their configurations were confirmed by 2D NMR and X-ray crystallography. The mechanism underlying the reaction was studied by monitoring 1H NMR and computational calculations, that is, the diastereomeric α- and β-products were equally formed through the SN1-like mechanism, while the β-product was gradually transformed via an SN2-like mechanism to the α-congener in the late step. Upon evaluation of the inhibitory effect of the synthesized lignans against α-glucosidases and free radicals, the lignans 7f and 7o of the phenolic hydroxyl group were the most potent inhibitors. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying the α-glucosidase inhibition of 7f and 7o were verified to be of a mixed manner and noncompetitive inhibition, respectively. The results indicated that both 7f and 7o possessed promising antidiabetic activity, while simultaneously inhibiting α-glucosidases and free radicals."
"['Hematology', 'Oncology']","Immunogenicity and risks associated with impaired immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and booster in hematologic malignancy patients: an updated meta-analysis  2022, The Author(s).Patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) have demonstrated impaired immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Factors associated with poor immunogenicity remain largely undetermined. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and medRxiv databases to identify studies that reported humoral or cellular immune responses (CIR) following complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The primary aim was to estimate the seroconversion rate (SR) following complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccination across various subtypes of HM diseases and treatments. The secondary aims were to determine the rates of development of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and CIR following complete vaccination and SR following booster doses. A total of 170 studies were included for qualitative and quantitative analysis of primary and secondary outcomes. A meta-analysis of 150 studies including 20,922 HM patients revealed a pooled SR following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of 67.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.8–70.4%; I2 = 94%). Meta-regression analysis showed that patients with lymphoid malignancies, but not myeloid malignancies, had lower seroconversion rates than those with solid cancers (R2 = 0.52, P < 0.0001). Patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CART), B-cell targeted therapies or JAK inhibitors were associated with poor seroconversion (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.0001). The pooled NAb and CIR rates were 52.8% (95% CI; 45.8–59.7%, I2 = 87%) and 66.6% (95% CI, 57.1–74.9%; I2 = 86%), respectively. Approximately 20.9% (95% CI, 11.4–35.1%, I2 = 90%) of HM patients failed to elicit humoral and cellular immunity. Among non-seroconverted patients after primary vaccination, only 40.5% (95% CI, 33.0–48.4%; I2 = 87%) mounted seroconversion after the booster. In conclusion, HM patients, especially those with lymphoid malignancies and/or receiving CART, B-cell targeted therapies, or JAK inhibitors, showed poor SR after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A minority of patients attained seroconversion after booster vaccination. Strategies to improve immune response in these severely immunosuppressed patients are needed."

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Malacological Society of London.Giant clams are organisms of significant ecological importance on coral reefs. They are known to help maintain oligotrophic conditions on reefs, to act as potential reservoirs of symbiotic dinoflagellates and as a consequence of their large, dense shells, to contribute to reef structural complexity. Despite this, little work has been done to investigate the utility of giant clam shells for coral recruitment. Here, we quantify scleractinian coral growth on living and dead giant clams around the Thai island of Koh Tao, a site with a history of environmental and anthropogenic pressure related to tourism. Transect surveys at 15 reefs around the island yielded 739 clams, of which 120 were found to support coral recruits. A total of 270 distinct corals were recorded between depths of 2.1 and 8 m (none were found at depths shallower than 2 m), with 29% found on dead shells and 71% on living clams. Differences were found in the community structure of hard corals found on clam shells vs those found in surrounding reef environments, with mushroom corals (Fungiidae) and Stylocoeniella being significantly more abundant on clam shells than on the natural reef. In contrast, corals abundant on surrounding reefs (e.g. Acropora and Porites) were disproportionately better represented on the reef than on clam shells. This suggests that giant clam shells may play a significant role in the succession of coral reefs with certain corals being preferentially supported over others."

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) are the major gut microbial molecules of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, respectively, and can induce inflammation in several organs. Here, the fibrosis in the kidney, liver, and heart was investigated in oral C. albicans-administered 5/6 nephrectomized (Candida-5/6 Nx) mice. At 20 weeks post 5/6 Nx, Candida-5/6 Nx mice demonstrated increased 24 h proteinuria, liver enzymes, and serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10), but not weight loss, systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, serum creatinine, or gut-derived uremic toxins (TMAO and indoxyl sulfate), compared to in 5/6 Nx alone. The gut leakage in Candida-5/6 Nx was more severe, as indicated by FITC-dextran assay, endotoxemia, and serum BG. The areas of fibrosis from histopathology, along with the upregulated gene expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and Dectin-1, the receptors for LPS and BG, respectively, were higher in the kidney, liver, and heart. In vitro, LPS combined with BG increased the supernatant IL-6 and TNF-α, upregulated the genes of pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic processes, Dectin-1, and TLR-4 in renal tubular (HK-2) cells and hepatocytes (HepG2), when compared with LPS or BG alone. This supported the pro-inflammation-induced fibrosis and the possible LPS–BG additive effects on kidney and liver fibrosis. In conclusion, uremia-induced leaky gut causes the translocation of gut LPS and BG into circulation, which activates the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways, causing internal organ fibrosis. Our results support the crosstalk among several organs in CKD through a leaky gut."

However, maintaining two plasmids in a single bacterial cell is not desirable; therefore, a single plasmid harboring both the PstDNV capsid and the dsRNA-YHV-pro gene was constructed under the regulation of a single T7 promoter, designated pET28a-Linked cpPstDNV-dspro. Following induction, this novel construct expressed an approximately 37-kDa recombinant protein associated with a roughly 400-bp dsRNA (Linked cpPstDNV-dspro). Under a transmission electron microscope, the virus-like particles (VLP; Linked PstDNV VLPs-dspro) obtained were seen to be monodispersed, similar to the native PstDNV virion. A nuclease digestion assay indicated dsRNA molecules were both encapsulated and present outside the Linked PstDNV VLPs-dspro. In addition, the amount of dsRNA produced from this strategy was higher than that obtained with a co-expression strategy. In a YHV infection challenge, the Linked PstDNV VLPs-dspro was more effective in delaying and reducing mortality than other constructs tested. Lastly, the linked construct provides protection for the dsRNA cargo from nucleolytic enzymes present in the shrimp hemolymph. This is the first report of a VLP carrying virus-inhibiting dsRNA that could be produced without disassembly and reassembly to control virus infection in shrimp."

Previous reports have described precipitating factors that lead to the condition; however, there is no prior report of the condition in a patient with a hypertensive emergency. The authors presented a case of a deceased 59-year-old male brought to the hospital with loss of consciousness in an episode of hypertensive emergency. The subsequent autopsy revealed hemorrhagic stroke as the cause of death and an incidental finding of intrathyroidal hemorrhage in a thyroid nodule. Further literature review revealed the demographic data as well as the presentation and progression of the patients with the condition. No cases of intrathyroidal hemorrhage and hypertensive emergency have been reported. Airway compression in thyroid hemorrhage can be rapid and fatal. In most cases, surgical intervention is usually required. In cases of spontaneous hemorrhage, there were always thyroid lesions. The present case is an early report of spontaneous intrathyroidal hemorrhage in a hypertensive emergency. Airway protection should be prioritized in case of intrathyroidal hemorrhage. Furthermore, attempt should be made to identify the underlying thyroid pathology. Extensive history taking can also guide attending physicians and pathologists to distinguish between spontaneous and traumatic hemorrhage. In addition, to prevent a fatal consequence, neck examination should also be performed in patients with hypertensive emergency."
['Medicine (all)'],"Correlation between Perfusion Index and Lactate Level in Critically Ill Patients  2022 JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND.Background: During shock resuscitation, early detection of tissue hypoperfusion would guide physician to actively manage for the better outcome. Serum lactate is commonly used but it needs blood sampling and obtains intermittent data. Perfusion index (PI) analyzed from pulse-oximetry signal is a non-invasive and continuous monitoring for peripheral tissue perfusion. Previous studies have shown correlations between PI and microcirculation parameters in critically ill patients; however, limited data is available. Objective: To investigate the correlation between PI and lactate level in critically ill patients. Materials and Methods: The present study was a prospective observational study at the surgical intensive care unit of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH). All critically ill patients having tissue hypoperfusion and serum lactate of 2 mmol/L or greater were enrolled. PI was measured by MasimoRadical-7®PulseCO-Oximeter® and recorded values simultaneously with serum lactate at 0, 2, 6, and 24-hours during resuscitation. Results: Of the 42 patients, the authors found a significant correlation between PI and lactate level at 0 and 2-hours (r=–0.397, p=0.009 and r=–0.311, p=0.045, respectively). The change in PI also significantly correlated with lactate clearance at first 6-hours of resuscitation (r=0.444, p=0.003 at 0 to 2-hour and r=0.370, p=0.017 at 2 to 6-hours). Twenty-four patients or 57% had lactate clearance of 10% or more within 2-hours, whereas 18 patients (42.8%) did not. The cut-off value of increasing in PI of less than 0.86 predicted patients who were not lactate clearance at 2-hours, (sensitivity 88.9%, specificity 54.2%, AUC 0.699, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86, p=0.029). Conclusion: PI may have value to adjunct continuous monitoring for peripheral perfusion during early resuscitation by using concurrently with serum lactate. Increase in PI of less than 0.86 within 2-hours should prompt the physician to manage it further."

The fact that many artefacts were produced—in such variety, over such a long period, and at so many sites—shows the popularity of the scene of the Śrāvastī miracles in the Dvāravatī culture. The objective of this research paper is to analyze the significance of the story of the Śrāvastī miracles that affected the creation of Dvāravatī art in Thailand by examining the textual sources together with the Dvāravatī artefacts. The analysis shows that the stories of the Śrāvastī miracles were significant in various ways, being one of the Buddha’s necessary deeds, a principal miracle only performed by the Buddha, a means of converting others to Buddhism, and a key source for the idea of making Buddha images as an act of merit. These significant features may explain the popularity of the Śrāvastī miracle theme in Dvāravatī culture."

To investigate mangosteen vinegar (MV) by steaming under high pressure, explore the effects of fermentation, antioxidant activity, and sensory evaluation acceptable using the 9 -point Hedonic scale. Steamed mangosteen was processed to produce 3 types of mangosteen vinegar: mangosteen rind vinegar (MRV), mangosteen flesh vinegar (MFV), and mangosteen rind plus flesh vinegar (MRFV). All 3 kinds of mangosteen vinegar were obtaining >4% acetic acid and significantly higher total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and free radical scavenging ABTS+ and DPPH- antioxidant activity than apple cider vinegar (ACV) (p < 0. 05). The phenolic compounds analysis of mangosteen vinegar using HPLC were found Gallic acid, Catechin, Epicatechin, Vanillic acid, Trans-ferulic acid, Rutin, Gamma-mongostin, and Alpha-mangostin which showed almost higher than that found in ACV. Therefore, MVs produced from streamed mangosteen have higher antioxidants and were more acceptable using the 9-point Hedonic scale, a significantly higher statistical analysis of sensory evaluation than ACV, especially MFV. Taken together, steamed MVs should be further studied to prove the health benefits as a dietary supplement."

However, the structure–activity relationship study of flavones on the anti-dengue activity remains mostly limited to the natural-occuring analogs. Herein, 27 flavone analogs were successfully synthesized, of which 5 analogs (5e, 5h, 5o, 5q, and 5r) were novel. In total, 33 analogs bearing a diverse range of substituents were evaluated for their efficacy against DENV2-infected LLC/MK2 cells. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups on ring B such as Br (5m) or NO2 (5n and 5q) enhanced the activity significantly. In particular, the tri-ester 5d and di-ester 5e exhibited low toxicity against normal cell, and exceptional DENV2 inhibition with the EC50 as low as 70 and 68 nM, respectively, which is over 300-fold more active compared to the original baicalein reference. The viral targets for these potent flavone analogs were predicted to be NS5 MTase and NS5 RdRp, as suggested by the likelihood ratios from the molecular docking study. The great binding interaction energy of 8-bromobaicalein (5f) confirms the anti-dengue activity at atomistic level. The physicochemical property of all the synthetic flavone analogs in this study were predicted to be within the acceptable range. Moreover, the QSAR model showed the strong correlation between the anti-dengue activity and the selected molecular descriptors. This study emphasizes the great potential of flavone as a core structure for further development as a novel anti-dengue agent in the future."

Effects of Au loading, catalyst dosage and types of hole scavenger on the photocatalytic gold recovery were investigated under ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) light irradiation at room temperature. It was found that different Au loadings tuned the light absorption capacity of the synthesized photocatalysts and enhanced the photocatalytic activity in comparison with the bare TiO2 NPs. The addition of CH3OH, C2H5OH, C3H8O, and Na2S2O3 as a hole scavenger significantly promoted the photocatalytic activity of the gold recovery, while the H2O2 did not. Among different hole scavengers employed in this work, the CH3OH exhibited the highest capability to promote the photocatalytic gold recovery. In summary, the Au0.5/TiO2 NPs exhibited the best photocatalytic activity to completely recover gold ions within 30 min at the catalyst dosage of 0.5 g/L, light intensity of 3.20 mW/cm2 in the presence of 20 vol% CH3OH as hole scavenger.

The significant size and textural tailored properties of materials synthesized through laser interaction with matter have emerged as a promising synthetic technique. The high-power pulsed laser-assisted synthesis of nanomaterials in liquids provides many degrees of parameter control (i.e., pulsed laser power, wavelength, reaction time duration, laser pulse repetition rate, and solvent) and numerous advantages over traditional physical and chemical synthetic methods, such as high purity, no byproducts, simple, nontoxic, and no need for surfactants and reducing agents. We first focused on the fundamental insights into the mechanism of pulsed laser techniques in depth in this paper, taking into account various experimental conditions to accelerate hypotheses that are appropriate for the production of efficient nanomaterials. We focused on the advancement of electro- and photoactive nanomaterials using pulsed laser synthetic technologies, which allowed us to reveal detailed mechanistic and textural properties as well as effective applications in energy and environmental processes.

The bloodstream is an important route for tumor metastasis, particularly for late-stage oral melanoma (LOM) and late-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (LOSCC). The present study aimed to investigate serum peptidome-based biomarkers of dogs with early-stage oral melanoma, LOM, LOSCC, benign oral tumors, chronic periodontitis and healthy controls, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A principal component analysis plot showed distinct clusters among all groups. Four peptides were identified, including peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP4 isoform X2 (FKBP4), steroid hormone receptor ERR1 (ESRRA or ERRA), immunoglobulin superfamily member 10 (IGSF10) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5). FKBP4, ESRRA and ABCB5 were found to be overexpressed in both LOM and LOSCC, whereas IGSF10 expression was markedly increased in LOSCC only. These four proteins also played a crucial role in numerous pathways of cancer metastasis and showed a strong relationship with chemotherapy drugs. In conclusion, this study showed rapid screening of canine oral tumors using serum and MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, potential serum peptidome-based biomarker candidates for LOM and LOSCC were identified."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background The amplification of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (pfgch1) in Plasmodium falciparum has been linked to the upregulation of the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes associated with resistance to the antimalarial drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. During the 1990s and 2000s, sulfadoxinepyrimethamine was withdrawn from use as first-line treatment in southeast Asia due to clinical drug resistance. This study assessed the temporal and geographic changes in the prevalence of pfdhfr and pfdhps gene mutations and pfgch1 amplification a decade after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine had no longer been widely used. Methods A total of 536 P. falciparum isolates collected from clinical trials in Thailand, Cambodia, and Lao PDR between 2008 and 2018 were assayed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were analyzed using nested PCR and Sanger sequencing. Gene copy number variations of pfgch1 were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Results Sequences of the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes were obtained from 96% (517/536) and 91% (486/536) of the samples, respectively. There were 59 distinct haplotypes, including single to octuple mutations. The two major haplotypes observed included IRNI-AGEAA (25%) and IRNL-SGKGA (19%). The sextuple mutation IRNL-SGKGA increased markedly over time in several study sites, including Pailin, Preah Vihear, Ratanakiri, and Ubon Ratchathani, whereas IRNI-AGEAA decreased over time in Preah Vihear, Champasak, and Ubon Ratchathani. Octuple mutations were first observed in west Cambodia in 2011 and subsequently in northeast Cambodia, as well as in southern Laos by 2018. Amplification of the pfgch1 gene increased over time across the region, particularly in northeast Thailand close to the border with Laos and Cambodia. Conclusion Despite the fact that SP therapy was discontinued in Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos decades ago, parasites retained the pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations. Numerous haplotypes were found to be prevalent among the parasites. Frequent monitoring of pfdhfr and pfdhps in these areas is required due to the relatively rapid evolution of mutation patterns."

To explore possible parameters from gated SPECT that could detected coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with normal perfusion images, we retrospectively selected patients who underwent a 2-day Tc-99 m MIBI adenosine stress/rest MPI and a subsequent invasive coronary angiography. Gated SPECT parameters, including end systolic volume (ESV), end diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and transient ischemic dilation (TID) ratio of patients with and without CAD were compared and assessed for their respective diagnostic performance using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). Results: Among 22 patients with normal perfusion images, 7 patients had CAD. Despite the small number of patients, we found significant differences between the ESV, the EDV, and the LVEF between patients with and without CAD. The analysis of ROC curve showed the stress ESV could excellently detect CAD (AUC = 0.900). The rest ESV, the stress EDV, the rest EDV, the stress LVEF and the rest LVEF could likewise perform well in the detection of CAD (AUC = 0.833, 0.819, 0.790, 0.862, and 0.838, respectively). In contrast, the change in LVEF and the TID ratio (AUC = 0.667 and 0.524, respectively) did not seem as reliable as other parameters. Optimal cutoffs for detection of CAD in patients with normal perfusion images from our study were ≥ 20.0 mL for the stress ESV, ≥ 71.0 mL for the stress EDV, ≤ 66.3 EF units for the stress LVEF, ≥ 18.0 mL for the rest ESV, ≥ 67.0 mL for the rest EDV and ≤ 70.0 EF unit for the rest LVEF. Conclusions: Gated SPECT parameters could facilitate detection of CAD in patient with normal perfusion images on Tc-99m MIBI MPI. These parameters should be carefully interpreted to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce false negative MPI."

Subgroups of DM were classified by diabetic retinopathy (DR) staging into no DR (DM-no DR), non-proliferative DR (DM-NPDR), proliferative DR (DM-PDR), and by glycemic control (well-controlled DM; HbA1c < 7%, poorly controlled DM; HbA1c ≥ 7%). Conjunctival swabs were performed for ocular surface microbiome analysis using conventional culture and next-generation sequencing analysis (NGS). A higher culture-positive rate was found in DM (15%) than in non-DM group (5%) (p value = 0.437). Pathogenic organisms and antibiotic-resistant strains were detected in the DR groups (DM-NPDR and DM-PDR). The NGS analysis showed that potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseriaceae, Escherichia-Shigella, and Pseudomonas predominated in DM, especially in DR. There was dissimilarity in the ocular surface microbiome between DM and non-DM groups. The subgroup analysis showed that the DR group had significantly different microbial community from DM-no DR and non-DM groups (p value < 0.05). The microbial community in the poorly controlled DM was also significantly different from well-controlled DM and non-DM groups (p < 0.001). Using the NGS method, our study is the first to signify the importance of DR and glycemic control status, which affect the changes in the ocular surface microbiome."
['Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine'],"Sex differences on outcomes of catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: A real-world systematic review and meta-analysis  2022 Heart Rhythm SocietyBackground: Sex differences have diversely affected cardiac diseases. Little is known whether these differences impact outcomes of catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Objectives: To assess the impact of sex differences on outcomes of catheter ablation of VT. Methods: Databases were searched from inception through December 2021. Effect estimates from individual studies were extracted and combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. The outcomes of interest included VT recurrence rates, all-cause mortality, and composite outcomes of mortality, left ventricular assistant device use, and heart transplantation following VT ablation. Results: Our analysis included 22 observational studies. There were 10,206 patients, of which 12.8% were women. We found no statistical difference between sexes for VT recurrence rate (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, P = .57, I2 = 14.9%). Similarly, there was statistical difference in neither all-cause mortality nor composite outcomes (pooled HR 0.93, P = .75, I2 = 59.1% and pooled HR 0.9, P = .33, I2 = 0%, respectively). There was a trend toward an increase in women undergoing VT ablation in the recent registries (P = .071). Conclusion: Our contemporary analysis suggests that sex may have no impact on clinical outcomes of catheter ablation of VT in patients with structural heart disease, though women are the underrepresented. However, recent VT ablation registries have involved more women in their studies. Future studies with a higher proportion of women are encouraged to verify the current perception."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism partly regulates the immune system and is associated with hepatic flare in chronic Hepatitis B virus infection (HBV). Our study identified the association between two distinct phases, VDR polymorphisms and HBV inactive carrier (IC) and chronic hepatitis (CH). Chronic HBV patients were enrolled from February to August 2020. An HBV viral load (VL) < 2,000 IU/ml twice for 6 months apart, with no prior history of HBV treatment, defined the IC phase. Six common polymorphisms in the VDR gene, including CdX-2, GATA, FokI, Bsml, ApaI, and TaqI, were studied using real-time PCR. The different outcomes in allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies in between groups and linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping were analyzed. Among 324 enrolled patients, there were 163 patients in IC and 161 patients in CH phases. The mean vitamin D levels were not statistically different between groups. The proportion of allele frequencies of CdX-2 in IC and CH was 53.7% and 62.7% for G allele, and 46.3% and 37.3% for A allele (p 0.019). The proportion of GG genotype of CdX-2 was less frequently found in patients with IC compared to that in patients with CH (27% vs 41%, p 0.028). By multivariate analysis, CdX-2 G/A genotypes were independently associated with IC, with adjusted odd ratio (OR) 1.83 (1.10–3.04), p 0.019. The LD mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) revealed high LD scores in Bsml/ApaI/TaqI (BAT) haplotype in both groups while, CdX-2/GATA and GATA/FokI demonstrated high LD score only in CH group. CdX-2 G/A genotypes were independently associated with IC status in Thai patients with chronic HBV infection. The difference in LD of the CdX-2/GATA and GATA/FokI haplotypes in between groups may represent a non-random selection resulting in the variation of immune control."

United European Gastroenterology Journal published by Wiley Periodicals LLC. on behalf of United European Gastroenterology.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which comprises Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is an idiopathic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. The incidence and prevalence of IBD are rapidly increasing worldwide, particularly in newly industrialized regions such as Asia. Although a large medical armamentarium is available for treating this chronic disease, IBD imposes a marked global disease burden. To understand the complex etiopathogenesis of this condition, it is important to consider the rapidly changing trends in its epidemiology in Asia. During the past few decades, the incidence and prevalence of IBD have significantly increased in both Asian countries and Asian immigrants in Western countries. In this review, we aimed to study and update the epidemiology of IBD in diverse Asian regions and among Asian immigrants in North America and Europe. Moreover, we highlighted that this population exhibits a unique disease phenotype, such as male predominance and high frequency of perianal fistula in Crohn's disease. Also, a different disease phenotype including more complicated disease such as perianal complications was noted in Asian Americans and Asian Europeans."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Quartz c-axis fabric characterization of the strike-slip ductile deformation within the Three Pagodas shear zone, western Thailand  2022 The Author(s)The Three Pagodas shear zone is associated with mainland Southeast Asia deformations. The evolution of the shear zone is divided into deformation phases D1a, D1b, and D2. The first phase (D1a) involved ductile sinistral shearing associated with metamorphism. Foliations are well developed in a NW–SE with variable dips from east to west. Stretching lineations show NW–SE trending strike and flatly plunge to the south. Based on deformation patterns exhibited by outcrop and microscopic analysis, D1a shows NW–SE trending of ductile sinistral shearing. Additionally, the quantitative analysis of mylonitic quartzite exhibits an oblique angle of quartz grain shape fabric and quartz c-axis fabric asymmetry. Sinistral simple shear was confirmed by kinematic vorticity (Wk). The spatial distribution of the kinematic velocity number (Wk) of D1a shows a range between 0.93 and 0.99 at the central and western parts of the shear zone, which is higher than the 0.82–0.85 range for the eastern part of the shear zone. The strain variation within the Three Pagodas shear zone derived from the kinematic vorticity number (Wk) shows that the central and the western parts have been deformed under simple shear more than the eastern part. D1b is represented by the exhumation of high-grade metamorphic complex from sinistral transpression. The last stage (D2) involved the inversion of this strike-slip system, which is represented by dextral strike-slip faults."

By implication, 6G capabilities present a massive benefit for the Internet of Things (IoT), considering a wide range of application domains. However, some security concerns in the IoT involving authentication and encryption protocols are currently under investigation. Thus, mechanisms implementing quantum communications in IoT devices have been explored to offer improved security. Algorithmic solutions that enable better quantum key distribution (QKD) selection for authentication and encryption have been developed, but having limited performance considering time requirements. Therefore, a new approach for selecting the best QKD protocol based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model, called Tree-CNN, is proposed using the Tanh Exponential Activation Function (TanhExp) that enables IoT devices to handle more secure quantum communications using the 6G network infrastructure. The proposed model is developed, and its performance is compared with classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other machine learning methods. The results obtained are superior to the related works, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.89% during testing and a time-cost performance of 0.65 s for predicting the best QKD protocol. In addition, we tested our proposal using different transmission distances and three QKD protocols to demonstrate that the prediction and actual results reached similar values. Hence, our proposed model obtained a fast, reliable, and precise solution to solve the challenges of performance and time consumption in selecting the best QKD protocol."

However, the methods in standard protocol were laborious and time consuming. An alternating pulverization, bead beating homogenizer, was purposed in its effectiveness for forensic casework. (1) Here, we applied this technique to the burnt cracked bone and tooth that recovered from house fire for forensic DNA analysis. After cleansed an external surface, the eight multidirectional motion tissue homogenizer, Precellys® evolution, was utilized to pulverize bone and tooth followed by a DNA extraction and amplification. For detection with a capillary electrophoresis, full profiles of autosomal STRs and Y-chromosomal STRs were recovered from tooth sample but the partial profile STR was demonstrated in bone sample. The new technique in bone homogenization was less time consuming (around 30 s), less exposure to chemical agents (no need of liquid nitrogen), high efficiency, with high-throughput productivity."

One promising approach for their removal is flotation because MPs are inherently hydrophobic. However, the very small particle size of MPs lowers the probability of MPs-bubble collision and attachment that in turn affects the efficiency of the process. To address this challenge, we propose the use of agglomeration-flotation, a technique using kerosene as a bridging liquid to enlarge the particle sizes of MPs and make them amenable to flotation. In this study, the effects of kerosene dosage on particle size enlargement and floatability of six types of MPs with 100–1000 µm size fractions were investigated. The results showed that MPs with lower density compared with water could easily float in water without bubble attachment and particle agglomeration required. So, the effects of agglomeration on removal were negligible. In contrast, agglomeration using kerosene enhanced the floatability of MPs with high-density plastics. Moreover, image analysis was used to determine the agglomerated MPs’ particle size. The results indicate that kerosene could agglomerate the MPs and enhanced the removal of MPs by agglomeration-flotation."

This study aimed to identify transcriptomic biomarkers among MAP genes for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer by analyzing differential gene expressions and correlations with tumor progression. Gene expression data of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to identify differentially expressed MAP genes (DEMGs). Their prognostic value was evaluated by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis. Moreover, the relationships between alterations in lung cancer hallmark genes and the expression levels of DEMGs were investigated. The candidate biomarker genes were validated using three independent datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on clinical samples. A total of 88 DEMGs were identified from TCGA data. The 20 that showed the highest differential expression were subjected to association analysis with hallmark genes. Genetic alterations in TP53, EGFR, PTEN, NTRK1, and PIK3CA correlated with the expression of most of these DEMGs. Of these, six candidates—NUF2, KIF4A, KIF18B, DLGAP5, NEK2, and LRRK2—were significantly differentially expressed and correlated with the overall survival (OS) of the patients. The mRNA expression profiles of these candidates were consistently verified using three GEO datasets and qRT-PCR on patient lung tissues. The expression levels of NUF2, KIF4A, KIF18B, DLGAP5, NEK2, and LRRK2 can serve as diagnostic biomarkers for LUAD and LUSC. Moreover, the first five can serve as prognostic biomarkers for LUAD, while LRRK2 can be a prognostic biomarker for LUSC. Our research describes the novel role and potential application of MAP-encoding genes in clinical practice."

All rights reserved.Asymmetrical internal stress profile within the kiln-dried lumber assessed using the restoring force technique on the half-split specimen has been investigated. Unlike the symmetrical internal stress profile in which the measured restoring force is completely described by an elastic beam theory, the asymmetrical internal stress profile also induces a so-called remnant force. By using the released strain and the elastic modulus data across the entire thickness obtained from the McMillen slice test, a numerical result based on the finite element model successfully simulates the restoring force profile for an entire range of both symmetric and asymmetric stress profiles. The finite element model is leveraged to evaluate the effect of asymmetry of stress profile on the remnant force. The value of the remnant force linearly depends on the stress profile deviation which is inferred to the level of asymmetric stress profile. (Received in July 2022, accepted in September 2022.

SPR-20  2022 by the authors.Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is listed as a high-priority pathogen because its infection is associated with a high mortality rate. It is urgent to search for new agents to treat such an infection. Our previous study isolated a soil bacterium (Brevibacillus sp. SPR-20), showing the highest antimicrobial activity against S. aureus TISTR 517 and MRSA strains. The present study aimed to purify and characterize anti-MRSA substances produced by SPR-20. The result showed that five active substances (P1–P5) were found, and they were identified by LC-MS/MS that provided the peptide sequences of 14–15 residues. Circular dichroism showed that all peptides contained β-strand and disordered conformations as the major secondary structures. Only P1–P4 adopted more α-helix conformations when incubated with 50 mM SDS. These anti-MRSA peptides could inhibit S. aureus and MRSA in concentrations of 2–32 μg/mL. P1 (NH2-VVVNVLVKVLPPPVV-COOH) had the highest activity and was identified as a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The stability study revealed that P1 was stable in response to temperature, proteolytic enzymes, surfactant, and pH. The electron micrograph showed that P1 induced bacterial membrane damage when treated at 1× MIC in the first hour of incubation. The killing kinetics of P1 was dependent on concentration and time. Mechanisms of P1 on tested pathogens involved membrane permeability, leakage of genetic material, and cell lysis. The P1 peptide at a concentration up to 32 μg/mL showed hemolysis of less than 10%, supporting its safety for human erythrocytes. This study provides promising anti-MRSA peptides that might be developed for effective antibiotics in the post-antibiotic era."

Then, the porous BC was dyed with a nitrogen containing carbonyl dye (C.I. Vat Olive B) followed by phosphorus doping and employed as a precursor for preparation of carbon nanofilament. The P/N doped BC mat precursor was stabilized at 330 °C for 2 h and carbonized at 800 °C for 2 h. SEM images confirmed that BC based carbon exhibited the entangled filament structure. To follow the conversion of BC mat to carbon nanofilament, FTIR analysis and Raman spectroscopy were carried out. FTIR spectra of stabilized mats showed that the cellulose carbon-carbon double band centered at 1600 cm−1 appeared strongly. In contrast, the intensity of this band markedly decreased at carbonization stage, resulting from the conversion of cellulose carbon-carbon double bond into carbon aromatic ring which exhibited weak intensity. The graphitic structure was confirmed by the presence of sp3 disorder hybridization and sp2 hybridization (D and G bands, respectively) shown in Raman spectra). In addition, XRD diffractograms further confirmed the existence of amorphous carbon peak found at 26°, indicating that the P/N dopants played a role in inducing the graphitic structure as well as improving carbon yield. Finally, the electrochemical performance as a carbon electrode were revealed."

In the past 2 decades, we have learned that PA is a highly prevalent syndrome that is largely attributable to pathogenic somatic mutations, that contributes to cardiovascular, metabolic, and kidney disease, and that when recognized, can be adequately treated with widely available mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and/or surgical adrenalectomy. Unfortunately, PA is rarely diagnosed, or adequately treated, mainly because of a lack of awareness and education. Most clinicians still possess an outdated understanding of PA; from primary care physicians to hypertension specialists, there is an urgent need to redefine and reintroduce PA to clinicians with a modern and practical approach.

Given ongoing hydropower dam development in the Sesan and Srepok Basins, the two most dammed tributaries in the Lower Mekong Basin, characterizing baseline drought events and understanding how dams modify downstream flow is needed to manage water resources and mitigate drought effects. We used the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to estimate streamflow data from 2001 to 2019. For both rivers, we found that runoff varied, but contributed about 75% of streamflow, followed by shallow and deep groundwater, which contributed up to 25%. We used the Standardized Runoff Index to characterize drought and detected frequent, severe, and prolonged drought events in the two basins. Severe and prolonged droughts in the 2009–2011 and 2015–2016 periods corresponded to the occurrence of Typhoon Ketsana and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Streamflow alteration can be caused by climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities such as hydropower dam development and operations (e.g., the timing and magnitude of water releases).

However, the long-term effects of microplastics on crustacean immunity are less understood, especially regarding their toxicity in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Effects of high-density polyethylene microplastics (HDPE-MPs) in feed on the mortality rate, hepatopancreas, and nonspecific immune system gene expression of Pacific white shrimp are presented. The LC50 at day 28 of HDPE-MP exposure was determined as 3.074% HDPE-MP in feed. A significant upregulation of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) genes was observed in shrimp that were fed with 0.1 and 0.5% of HDPE-MP; then, they were downregulated significantly, except for the SOD gene expression of shrimp fed with 0.1% of HDPE-MP. The lysozyme (LYZ) gene was upregulated significantly in shrimp that were fed with 0.5, 1, and 3% HDPE-MP for 7 days and downregulated significantly in HDPE-receiving groups for at least 14 days. Significant histopathological changes in the hepatopancreas were observed in the treatment groups. The histopathological score of each lesion was correlated with the increase in HDPE-MP concentration. This study shows that the ingestion of HDPE microplastics can alter the expression of nonspecific immune system genes and damage the hepatopancreas in Pacific white shrimp."

In this study, five resveratrol derivatives were evaluated for anticancer activity and Akt/mTOR targeting activity in non-small lung cancer cell lines. The effects of resveratrol derivatives on cell proliferation were assessed by 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, nucleus staining, and colony formation assay. Furthermore, the effect of resveratrol derivatives on proliferation-related protein expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. For the structure–activity relationship (SAR), results reveal that two derivatives of resveratrol which are 4,4′-(ethane-1,2-diyl) bis(2-methoxyphenol) (RD2) and the 4-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenethyl)-2-methoxyphenol (RD3) had very similar structures but exerted different cytotoxicity. The IC50 of RD2 and RD3 were 108.6 ± 10.82 and more than 200 µM in the A549 cell line and 103.5 ± 6.08 and more than 200 µM in H23 cells, respectively. RD2 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis when compared with the control, while RD3 caused minimal effects. Cells treated with RD2 exhibited apoptotic nuclei in a concomitant with the reduction of cellular p-Akt and p-mTOR. RD3 had minimal effects on such proteins. According to these results, molecular docking analysis revealed a high-affinity interaction between RD2 and an Akt molecule at the ATP-binding and the allosteric sites, indicating this RD2 as a potential Akt inhibitor. This study provides useful information of resveratrol derivatives RD2 for treating lung cancer via Akt/mTOR inhibition."

According to several studies, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an essential role in lung cancer metastasis. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential pharmacological effect of cycloartocarpin on the suppression of metastasis-related behaviors and EMT. An MTT assay was used to examine cell viability. Cell migration was determined using a wound healing assay. Anchorage-independent cell growth was also performed. Western blot analysis was used to identify the key signaling proteins involved in the regulation of EMT and migration. The results found that non-toxic concentrations of cycloartocarpin (10–20 μM) effectively suppressed cell migration and attenuated anchorage-independent growth in H292, A549, and H460 cells. Interestingly, these effects were consistent with the findings of Western blot analysis, which revealed that the level of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), phosphorylated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (p-AKT), and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) were significantly reduced, resulting in the inhibition of the EMT process, as evidenced by decreased N-cadherin, vimentin, and slug expression. Taken together, the results suggest that cycloartocarpin inhibits EMT by suppressing the FAK/AKT signaling pathway, which is involved in Cdc42 attenuation. Our findings demonstrated that cycloartocarpin has antimetastatic potential for further research and development in lung cancer therapy."

Clinical benefit from sensory tricks can be observed before tactile contact is made or even by imagination. The supplementary motor area (SMA) may dynamically interact with the sensorimotor network and other brain regions during sensory tricks in patients with CD. In this study, we examined the functional connectivity of the SMA at rest and during sensory trick performance and imagination in CD patients compared to healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The functional connectivity between the SMA and left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) region was lower in CD patients at rest and it increased with sensory trick imagination and performance. SMA-right cerebellum connectivity also increased with sensory trick imagination in CD patients, while it decreased in healthy controls. In CD patients, SMA connectivity increased in the brain regions involved in sensorimotor integration during sensory trick performance and imagination. Our study results showed a crucial role of SMA in sensorimotor processing during sensory trick performance and imagination and suggest the IPS as a novel potential therapeutic target for brain modulation."

While important, evaluating the operational performance of a dry port is especially challenging since it depends not only on internal factors, such as the variety and number of container handling equipment (CHE) deployed, but also on other external factors, including changes in transportation policies and container demands experienced by a dry port. To properly evaluate the holistic performance of a dry port while considering all the aforementioned factors, a discrete event simulation (DES) framework is herein developed and applied to the Ladkrabang Inland Container Depot (LICD)—one of the largest dry ports in Southeast Asia—under various operational settings. Despite complicated internal operations, the devised DES framework has shown itself useful in the analyses of LICD, due largely to its flexibility that allows users to include sophisticated operational rules into models. According to our computational results, the current LICD operation is markedly ineffective as the usage rates of all CHE types are relatively low and varied across gate operators —especially the yard truck whose values range between 2.46% and 11.15% on yearly average. We also find that, by redesigning the LICD and its internal operations, the LICD’s performance could be substantially enhanced—even with fewer numbers of CHE. Regarding the four CHE types, the reach stacker seems to limit LICD’s capability, as its utilization tends to first reach the maximum allowable rate of 75%, while the rubber tyred gantry crane could help boost the usage rate of yard trucks, which, in turn, results in reduced container dwelling times. Nonetheless, the modified LICD could accommodate up to 140% of the current container demand before it experiences operational difficulties induced by the saturation of container flow from rail transportation."

Materials and methods:: The study population included 201 HCC patients treated with radiotherapy. The patients’ medical records were retrospectively reviewed to obtain the clinical and radiotherapy data. Toxicity was defined by albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade increase. The normal liver dose-volume histogram was reduced to mean liver dose (MLD) based on the fraction size-adjusted equivalent uniform dose (2 Gy/fraction and α/β = 2). Three types of ML-based classification models were used, a penalized logistic regression (PLR), random forest (RF), and gradient-boosted tree (GBT) model. Model performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Internal validation was performed by 5-fold cross validation and external validation was done in 44 new patients. Results:: Liver toxicity occurred in 87 patients (43.1%). The best individual model was the GBT model using baseline liver function, liver volume, and MLD as inputs and the best overall model was an ensemble of the PLR and GBT models. An AUROC of 0.82 with a standard deviation of 0.06 was achieved for the internal validation. An AUROC of 0.78 with a standard deviation of 0.03 was achieved for the external validation. The behaviors of the best GBT model were also in good agreement with the domain knowledge on NTCP. Conclusion:: We propose the methodology to develop an ML-based NTCP model to estimate the risk of ALBI grade increase."

In overcoming this constraint, this study applied a nested logit model to examine the RH adoption behaviors in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, categorizing them into five groups: self-request riders, riders requested by others, current non-riders, RH app-less non-riders, and RH app-installed non-riders. The influence factors of RH adoption among older adults are also investigated. By involving 289 older adults aged 50 years and above, the study found that women and older adults aged between 50 and 54 years were likely to be self-request riders. Meanwhile, low-income RH riders tend to ask others to request RH. Additionally, older adults living in households that own more cars and motorbikes were less likely to be self-request riders. Concerning technology response, the study found that smartphone ownership affects RH riders to self-request, while RH app-installed non-riders come from older adults who have used smartphones for a long time. Riders with good health conditions continue to use RH services to support their mobility needs. Limited abilities related to technology, senses, and physique experienced by older adults also significantly impact the adoption behaviors of RH services. The findings provide a starting point for increasing the availability of RH services to substantially older adults, especially those who have barriers to using technology."

This study aims to develop a communication model suitable for SMEs during succession for innovation and business sustainability. Nine innovative manufacturing family SMEs in Thailand are selected using assembled multiple-case study method, and in-depth individual interviews are conducted using data triangulation method which the incumbents, successors, and long-serving non-family employees as participants from each business. There are two main findings. Issues regarding organizational innovation, social capital in the form of internal and external network relationships, traditional and territorial knowledge, succession planning and procedure, and sustainability-driven mindset should be communicated, formally or informally, during the succession process. Secondly, the incumbent's contradiction between his intention and action, the successor's ability and willingness, and the staff's response to changes during the succession process, are the main communication barriers against achieving innovation and sustainability. By implementing the communication model to the family business, the incumbents and successors can maximize the business's structure and resources to be better understood throughout the firm with the business maintaining or reinterpreting its cultures, values, and traditions to the next generation. The model allows family businesses to have better awareness in terms of innovation management, social capital, innovation with their background knowledge as capital, succession, and business sustainability. Successful communication of the topics and concepts during succession should raise the standard and competitiveness of family businesses domestically and internationally."
"['Animal Science and Zoology', 'Veterinary (all)']","Effects of Low Dietary Cation and Anion Difference on Blood Gas, Renal Electrolyte, and Acid Excretions in Goats in Tropical Conditions  2022 by the authors.Goats can suffer from intermittent heat stress in high ambient temperature (HTa) conditions, which causes sporadic respiratory hypocapnia. Obstructive urolithiasis is a common urological problem in goats. Sandy uroliths can be partially relieved by urine acidification with short-term ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) treatment. However, the outcome of urine acidification and the physiological responses to short-term NH4Cl supplementation under respiratory hypocapnia of HTa have rarely been reported. The present study investigated the effect of NH4Cl supplementation that produced a low dietary cation-anion different (l-DCAD) diet on acid-base balance and renal function under HTa conditions. The first experiment investigated the physiological responses to natural HTa to prove whether the peak HTa during the afternoon could induce HTa responses without a change in the plasma cortisol. The partial pressure of CO2 also tended to decrease during the afternoon. The second experiment examined the short-term effect of l-DCAD under HTa conditions. Although the blood pH was within the normal range, there was a clear acid-base response in the direction of metabolic acidosis. The major responses in renal function were an increase in tubular function and acid excretion. With a comparable level of creatinine clearance, the fractional excretions (FE) of chloride and calcium increased, and the FE of potassium decreased. Acid excretion increased significantly in the l-DCAD group. We conclude that under HTa conditions, the tubular excretion of electrolytes and acids was the major response to acid loading without changing the filtration rate. The l-DCAD formulation can be used to acidify urine effectively."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Compressed composite carbon felt as a negative electrode for a zinc–iron flow battery  2022, The Author(s).Flow batteries possess several attractive features including long cycle life, flexible design, ease of scaling up, and high safety. They are considered an excellent choice for large-scale energy storage. Carbon felt (CF) electrodes are commonly used as porous electrodes in flow batteries. In vanadium flow batteries, both active materials and discharge products are in a liquid phase, thus leaving no trace on the electrode surface. However, zinc-based flow batteries involve zinc deposition/dissolution, structure and configuration of the electrode significantly determine stability and performance of the battery. Herein, fabrication of a compressed composite using CF with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is investigated in a Zn–Fe flow battery (ZFB). Graphene (G) is successfully introduced in order to improve its electrochemical activity towards zinc reactions on the negative side of the ZFB. A compressed composite CF electrode offers more uniform electric field and lower nucleation overpotential (NOP) of zinc than a pristine CF, resulting in higher zinc plating/stripping efficiency. Batteries with modified electrodes are seen to provide lower overpotential. Particularly, the G-PVDF-CF electrode demonstrates maximum discharge capacity of 39.6 mAh cm−2 with coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency over 96% and 61%, respectively. Finally, results lead to increased efficiency and cycling stability for flow batteries."

In the present study, Ni-based MGA 1400 alloy was modified by adding 4 wt% of Re and 6.4 wt% of Co by vacuum arc melting. The effects of Re and Co additions on lattice parameters of gamma and gamma prime phases were studied by TEM and XRD techniques. Calculated lattice misfit values obtained from XRD and TEM techniques were used to identify the shape and morphology of gamma prime precipitated particles after long-Term exposure at 1173 K for 1800 ks? After long-Term exposure, gamma prime particles became much coarser. The addition of Re retarded the coarsening rate of the gamma prime precipitates, resulting in smaller gamma prime particles at the same annealing times. Even though, both Re and Co atoms are strongly partitioned in the gamma matrix, the effect of Re and Co additions on lattice misfits was contradictory. The addition of Re produced rounded corner cuboidal morphology of gamma prime precipitates due to higher magnitude with negative lattice misfit (-0.3857%), while Co addition provided a more rounded shape of gamma prime particles due to the lattice misfit value approach to zero (+0.0936%)."

Methods: A cross–sectional descriptive study obtained the baseline data from the project named the Thailand Parental Supply and Use of Alcohol, Cigarettes & Drugs Longitudinal Study Cohort in Secondary School Students in 2018. The sample size was 1187 students who have ever sipped or drank alcohol in the past 12 months. Pearson’s Chi square, binary logistic regression, and ordinal logistic regression are applied in the analysis. Results: A single source of parental supply is not significantly associated with any alcohol-related harm and the severity of alcohol use disorder, while parental supply with peers and siblings supply of alcohol plays an important role in both outcomes. The increasing number of sources of alcohol supply increases the risk of alcohol–related harm and the severity of alcohol use disorder. Other risk factors found in both associations included binge drinking, alcohol flushing, low household economic status, distance from the student’s family, and poor academic performance. Gender, exposure to alcohol ads on social media and location of residency were not associated with alcohol–related harms or severity of alcohol use disorder. Conclusions: The results did not support parental guidance in teaching or giving children a drink or sip of alcohol within family to prevent related harms when drinking outside with their peers."

This is to ensure the safe, reliable, and efficient production and consumption of fuel-grade bioethanol. The analysis utilised the established economic minimum bioethanol plant capacity of 158,000 m3/annum. The processing flowsheet model utilised was the same for each feedstock. The sustainability study's economic, environmental, and energy perspectives were investigated. The economic and environmental indices were assessed using Superpro Designer and openLCA sustainability software, respectively. Exergy and lost work were subsequently estimated manually with Microsoft Excel. The economic analyses showed that the plants using cassava and sweet potato initially had the highest return on investment (ROI) of 64.41 and 41.96% respectively at a minimum of 80% plants’ capacity utilisation. The break-even point occurs at a bioethanol price of $3.27 per gallon, beyond which positive net present values were obtained for the four processes. The least profitable plant was based on sorghum recording an ROI value of 34.11%. The environmental assessment on the four selected feedstocks showed that the processes based on cassava, corn, sweet potato, and sorghum recorded encouraging global warming potential (GWP) of 0.2452, 0.2067, 2.5261, and 0.2099 kg CO2 equivalent respectively. Cassava and corn emerged as the two most economically viable feedstocks when economic parameters were adjusted to include pollutants emission/discharge costs but with a slight decrease in profitability indices. The lost work analyses showed that distillation columns were the least energy-efficient units in the four bioethanol production routes assessed, recording loss work of about 61, 68, 34, and 49 MW for cassava, sweet potato, corn, and sorghum processing plants respectively. However, the net energy balance (NEB) and energy renewability results of the four production routes showed that the processes utilising the four selected starchy biomass feedstocks are more sustainable compared to fossil fuels."

Reducing avoidable return visits can improve ED effectiveness and emergency care. This study evaluated the effects of an increase in the number of physicians and the 24-h coverage of emergency physicians on 48-h ED revisits with subsequent hospital admission. The characteristics and risk factors of the patients were also investigated. Results: This was a retrospective analysis performed 2 years before and 2 years after the implementation of an intervention in a tertiary care hospital in Thailand. The medical records of adult patients who revisited the ED within 48 h for related complaints were reviewed. The effect of the intervention was analyzed, and a prediction model was developed based on logistic regression. After implementing the intervention, the hospital admission rate at the second ED visit decreased from 44.5 to 41.1%; no significant difference was found (95% confidence interval (CI) − 5.05 to 11.78). Patients who required hospital admission had a significantly higher comorbidity score, more ED visits, and more hospitalizations within the past 12 months. A significantly higher hospital admission rate was also observed among patients older than 60 years, those who had an initial infectious diagnosis, and those who had a higher triage severity level (ESI II) at their first visit. The odds ratio (OR) showed lower odds of hospital admission at the second visit in the postintervention period; this difference was not significant (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.23). Conclusion: Our intervention did not significantly decrease the incidence of admission at an ED revisit. However, some factors identified in this study seem to have some benefits and might be helpful for preventing errors and constructing a standard discharge care plan for patients with these risk factors."

In this study, we developed a chitosan nanoparticle TiLV immersion vaccine and assessed the efficacy of the vaccine in laboratory and field trials. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the inactivated vaccine had a particle size of 210.3 nm, while the nano inactivated vaccine had a spherical shape with a diameter of 120.4 nm. Further analysis using fluorescent staining and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the mucoadhesive properties of the nanovaccine (CN-KV) through fish gills. We assessed the efficacy of an immersion-based TiLV nanovaccine using a cohabitation challenge model. The fish that received the nanovaccine showed better relative percent survival (RPS) at 68.17% compared with the RPS of the inactivated virus vaccine (KV) group at 25.01%. The CN-KV group also showed a higher TiLV-specific antibody response than the control and KV groups (p < 0.05). Importantly, under field conditions, the fish receiving the CN-KV nanovaccine had better RPS at 52.2% than the nonvaccinated control group. Taken together, the CN-KV nanovaccinated fish showed better survival and antibody response than the control and KV groups both under laboratory control challenge conditions and field trials. The newly developed immersion-based nanovaccine is easy to administer in small fish, is less labor-intensive, and allows for mass vaccination to protect fish from TiLV infection."

Simulations were conducted using the realizable k-epsilon model and the wall function. The simulation results show that the hole positions affect the Nusselt number and friction factor values. The Nusselt number was highest when the hole position was located near the dead zone of the flow field. This can be evinced with a temperature distribution on an absorber plate. The effect of hole positions on the friction factor can be explained by flow velocity distributions in the x-direction of the air influx. The velocity distributions revealed that a hole in a proper position reduces the momentum flux flowing toward the winglet vortex generator, resulting in a less pressure drag."

An in vitro inhibitory activity evaluation of caffeic acid (1) and its amide derivatives (2 − 4) against the steroid 5α-reductase type 1 (SRD5A1) produced by human keratinocyte cells coupled with the non-radioactive high-performance thin-layer chromatography detection revealed that caffeic acid N-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] amide (4) was a promising non-steroidal suppressor, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.44 ± 0.13 µM and relatively low cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 29.99 ± 8.69 µM. The regulatory role of compound 4 against SRD5A1 involved both suppression of SRD5A1 expression and mixed mode SRD5A1 inhibition. The Ki value of compound 4 was 2.382 µM based on the whole-cell kinetic studies under specific conditions. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations with AlphaFold generated the human SRD5A1 structure and confirmed the stability of compound 4 at the SRD5A1 catalytic site with greater interactions, including hydrogen bonding of the key M119 amino-acid residue than those of finasteride and dutasteride. Thus, compound 4 shows the potential for further development as an SRD5A1 suppressor for androgenic alopecia treatment."

Madecassoside and asiaticoside are two major components of the extract and can be converted into active metabolites, triterpenic acids in large mammal species. In this study, the pharmacokinetic profiles and metabolomic changes generated by the bioactive triterpenoids of Centell-S alone, and in combination with the bioenhancers piperine and curcumin, were investigated in beagle dogs. The test substances were orally administered over multiple doses for 7 consecutive days. At day 1 and 7 after receiving the test compounds, the level of major bioactive triterpenoids and related metabolites were measured using triple quadrupole and high-resolution accurate mass orbitrap models of LCMS to determine pharmacokinetic and metabolomic profiles, respectively. Centell-S was well tolerated, alone and in all combination groups. The combination of Centell-S and piperine significantly increased (p < 0.05) the systemic exposure of madecassoside on day 1 and asiatic acid on day 7, by approximately 1.5 to 3.0-fold of Cmax and AUC values as compared to the Centell-S alone, while the addition of curcumin did not provide a significant improvement. Several metabolomic changes were observed from pre-dose to 4 h post-dose, with some biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases including l-glutamine, lysophosphatidylcholine (17:0), taurochenodeoxycholic acid, uric acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, and lactic acid showing good correlation with the systemic exposure of the bioactive triterpenoids (asiatic acid). Thus, the combining of piperine to Centell-S exhibits the improvement of bioactive triterpenoids which are related to the biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. These promising results might be useful for the development of this standardised extract to become a more effective phytomedicine for neurodegenerative diseases."

Methods This quasi-experimental study comprised 76 CD wearers. The two patient-based outcomes were oral health-related quality of life and masticatory performance, determined by the Thai-version of oral impacts on daily performances index and multiple sieve method of 20-stroke peanut mastication. Denture retention and stability were evaluated using the CU-modified Kapur criteria to classify the CD into acceptable or unacceptable quality. The outcomes were collected at 3 time points: 1) at baseline (T0), 2) after a 1-month run-in period of DA use (T1), at which time the participants decided whether to continue using DA, and 3) 1-month after continuing or discontinuing using DA (T2). Changes in the percentages of having an oral impact from T0 to T2 were evaluated using the McNemar’s test. The effect of denture quality and the decision to use DA on peanut particle size across time points were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. The peanut particle size changes in each group between time points were evaluated using the one-way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc comparison test. Results The participants who continued using DA at T2 had greater oral impact reduction after the 1-month run-in period of DA use, whereas cleaning and emotional impacts emerged in those who discontinued using DA. At T1 and T2, the peanut particle size of the participants who continued and discontinued using DA was not significantly changed from T0, except for the acceptable CD wearers who discontinued using DA at T2, whose peanut particle size decreased from T0 to T2. Conclusions Baseline oral impacts and their change influenced CD wearers’ decision whether to continue using DA. However, masticatory performance did not affect the patients’ decision."

All rights reserved.In this study, the possibility of directly dating archaeometallurgical slags is assessed. The enormous slag heaps distributed in the Ban Kruat district, Buriram Province, Thailand, have been interpreted as one of the most prominent archaeometallurgical sites in Mainland Southeast Asia. Therefore, five slag samples were collected from the topmost level of two heaps. The X-ray diffraction measurement of each slag revealed the existence of quartz minerals, which is conceptually useful to luminescence dating. Based on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements, two of the five samples showed a weak luminescence signal, which was not suitable for OSL dating, and may reflect the lack of quartz minerals. However, the other three quartz-rich slag samples clearly expressed an OSL signal. Therefore, 40 or 96 aliquots of a single aliquot regenerative measurement were employed to date them. With the combination of the activated dose rate obtained from environmental radioactive elements (U, Th, and K), two timespans of iron-smelting activity were defined, as approximately 140 y ago and 470-710 y ago. Compared with the radiocarbon dates of the adjacent slag heap in Buriram (560±280 y BP), the 140-y-old slag heap dated in this study is younger and represents the latest (most recently) datable iron-smelting industry in the Angkor highland (Thailand). Meanwhile, the radiocarbon dates (140±20 y BP) of the slag heap in the Angkor lowland (Cambodia) conformed to the date obtained in this study. Therefore, it is concluded that OSL dating is effective for direct dating of the slag-bearing quartz."

Both lipoyl-substituted porphyrin and Mn(III)-complex were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, absorption spectrophotometry, and emission spectrophotometry. Both compounds were considered to have low cytotoxicity with IC50values of 29-49 and more than 78 μM, respectively, against the HaCaT and HDFa cells. In addition, mitochondria- targeting evaluation suggested that these target porphyrin derivatives exhibited accumulation, specifically in the mitochondria of the HaCaT cells."
['Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine'],"Outcomes and predictors of one-year mortality in patients hospitalized with Acute Heart Failure  2022 The AuthorsBackground: Registries of patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF) provided useful description of characteristics and outcomes. However, a contemporary registry which provides sufficient evidence on outcomes after discharge is needed. Objective: The study aims to identify 1-year clinical outcomes and prognostic predictors of patients hospitalized with AHF. Method: This is a retrospective registry which enrolled patients who were hospitalized due to a principal diagnosis of AHF in a tertiary care center in Thailand between July 2017 and June 2019. Baseline characteristics and hospital courses between the deceased patients and the survivors at 1 year were compared. Prognostic predictors for 1-year mortality were analyzed using Cox regression model. Results: A total of 759 patients were enrolled (mean age of 68.9 ± 15 years, 49.8% men, mean ejection fraction of 47.1 ± 19.2%, 55.7% heart failure reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)). Among these, 40.7% had no history of heart failure. The in-hospital and 1-year mortality was 5.8% and 21.5%, respectively. Patients with HFrEF had lower 1-year mortality compared to those without (HR = 0.57, p = 0.04). Age ≥ 70 years, the history of heart failure, prior heart failure hospitalization, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), reactive airway disease, cancer, length of stay > 10 days and NT-proBNP ≥ 10,000 pg/mL were associated with higher 1-year mortality (p < 0.05). The multivariate analysis showed age, CVA and NT-proBNP were independent predictors. Conclusion: Patients with AHF had high mortality after discharge. Patients with poor prognostic predictors, such as elderly, may benefit from continuous care. The study is the most recent registry of patients with AHF in Thailand."
"['Reproductive Medicine', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']","The effect of Moringa oleifera capsule in increasing breast milk volume in early postpartum patients: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial  2022 The AuthorsObjectives: Moringa oleifera is an herbal galactagogue that is used to increase the volume of breast milk. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Moringa oleifera leaves in increasing the volume of breast milk in early postpartum mothers. Methods: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Eighty-eight postpartum women were randomized to either the study group receiving oral Moringa oleifera capsules or to the control group receiving oral placebo capsules. Results: There was no difference in median breast milk volume on the third day of postpartum between the Moringa oleifera leaf group and the control group (73.5 vs 50 ml, p = 0.19). However, the amount of breast milk in the Moringa oleifera group was 47% more than the one in the control group. The exclusive breastfeeding rate at 6 months in this study was 52.3% in the Moringa oleifera group, which met the goals set by the World Health Organization. Conclusions: Even 900 mg/day of the Moringa oleifera leaf could not significantly increase breast milk volume in early postpartum mothers, but the amount of breast milk in the Moringa oleifera group was 47% more than the one in the control group. The exclusive breastfeeding rate at 6 months in the Moringa oleifera group achieved the goals set by the WHO. Therefore, Moringa oleifera leaf may be used as a galactagogue herb to increase the volume of breast milk."

Inactivation of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) contaminating equipment and premises is an effective biosecurity risk management measure to prevent the introduction of ASFV through contaminated fomites and the environment. Even though some chemical agents' virucidal activity against ASFV was previously demonstrated, compound disinfectants are still limited. For the fact that the ASFV titer in some excretions from pigs was far >4 log. Even after the application of disinfectants as instructed by the manufacturers, the excessive ASFV load in the excretions from pigs could contaminate fomites or the environment. To solve this dilemma, the concept of contact time of disinfectant for 1–log reduction was introduced, as the decimal reduction time or D value. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the inactivation rate of four compound disinfectants against ASFV as the D value. Four compound disinfectants (iodine and phenol, quaternary ammonium and alcohol, and two quaternary ammonium and glutaraldehyde compounds) currently used in the veterinary field were evaluated in a suspension test at 25 °C in the absence of interfering substances. Primary porcine alveolar macrophages were used to determine the titer of ASFV genotype II (strain VNUA/HY-ASF1/Vietnam/2019). The virucidal activity of four compound disinfectants achieved 4–log ASFV reduction. The mean D0.5%, D0.25%, and D0.125% values of all disinfectants inactivating ASFV were 1.62–3.60, 2.60–3.8, and 2.89–3.90 min, respectively. The D value of disinfectants allows users to manipulate the appropriate concentration and/or contact time of the disinfectant, depending on the magnitude of ASFV contamination, to completely inactivate the ASFV titer on the fomites to minimise a potential biosecurity risk."

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. All rights reserved.Background: We compared weight changes in virally suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH) switching to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) with those remaining on an INSTI or non-INSTI regimen. Methods: PLWH aged ≥18years with weight measurements available at baseline between 2001 and 2020 were included. Viral suppression was defined as having had a viral load <400copies/mL for 6months. Baseline was defined as the time of switching from a non-INSTI to an INSTI regimen whilst virally suppressed (switch group) or the time that viral suppression was achieved (remain groups). Generalized estimating equations adjusted for age, sex and baseline weight were used to model weight changes 6, 12, 18 and 24months after baseline. Results: A total of 1673 PLWH contributed 1952 episodes of viral suppression - 143 (7.3%) episodes were among PLWH who had switched from a non-INSTI to an INSTI, 102 (5.2%) episodes were among PLWH who remained on an INSTI and 1707 (87.4%) episodes were among PLWH who remained on a non-INSTI. PLWH in the switch group had significantly greater weight gain than those in the remain groups at 6, 12 and 18months after achieving viral suppression. By 24months, weight change on all regimens started to converge. Tenofovir alafenamide use was not significantly associated with weight gain in adjusted models. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the mechanisms of weight gain due to INSTI use go beyond their superior efficacy over other antiretrovirals in controlling HIV or the effect of the 'return-to-health' phenomenon. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of such weight gain."

"['Building and Construction', 'Geophysics', 'Geology']","Performance assessment of weighted mean temperature models derived from AIRS and ERA5 reanalysis for calculating GPS precipitable water vapor in the thailand region  2022, Akadémiai Kiadó.The determination of Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) using GNSS data with Precise Point Processing (PPP) is a useful alternative for precisely estimating atmospheric water vapor. The use of GNSS data allows for all-weather PWV tracking 24 h a day, 7 days a week. The weighted mean temperature (Tm) is an important variable in deriving GNSS-PWV values with high accuracy, especially in tropical zones. Unfortunately, the usual method of obtaining Tm is through expensive meteorological instruments such as radiosondes which are not available in every region of Thailand. This current research derives empirical models of Tm based on two data sets: one provided by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS/Aqua platform, and one provided in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ (ECMWF) ERA5 Reanalysis. GNSS-PWV was calculated for 76 GNSS CORS around Thailand using Tm values calculated by the developed models in conjunction with GipsyX software. Results were validated against AIRS-PWV values, and compared against other existing Tm models. Results based on the developed AIRS-Tm and ERA5-Tm models, as well as the existing Suwantong, Bevis, Mendes, Schueler, and GPT3 models, showed mean biases in PWV difference against AIRS-PWV values of 0.3, 0.2, − 0.3, 1.0, 0.8, 1.8, and 1.1 mm, respectively. These results conclude that the mean bias of GPS-PWV estimations can be reduced when a more localized countrywide Tm model is used versus a global model."

However, the taxonomic revision of all extant taxa in the region is still ongoing. In this study, the genus Pilsbryoconcha was revised based on an integrative analysis of shell morphology, biogeography, and molecular data. Multi-locus phylogeny indicated the availability of eight species within the genus. Four previously recognized species are P. exilis (Lea, 1838), P. schomburgki (Martens, 1860) stat. rev., P. linguaeformis (Morelet, 1875), and P. carinifera (Conrad, 1837), while four other species are described herein as P. acuta sp. nov., P. mekongiana sp. nov., P. kittitati sp. nov., and P. hoikaab sp. nov. In addition, the neotype of P. carinifera is also designated to clarify its long taxonomic ambiguity. Divergent time estimation and historical biogeography analysis revealed that Pilsbryoconcha originated in the area now called the Khorat Plateau around the middle of the Eocene (mean age = 43.12 Mya), before its range was expanded across Indochina through a series of complex geomorphological changes of river systems, which also led to diversification of the genus."

As the use of grey solutions has become a serious issue due to environmental consequences during the last few decades, green/nature-based solutions have become prioritized. This study evaluates the effectiveness of grey and green solutions applied along the eastern Chao Phraya Delta (ECPD) based on historical shoreline change analysis and coastal observations using Light Detection and Ranging technology. The results from shoreline analysis indicate that nearshore breakwaters installed 100–250 m from the shoreline have successfully reclaimed the coastline with a sedimentation rate of 17–23 cm/y. Meanwhile, sand-sausage-submerged breakwaters were ineffective at stabilizing the coastline during 2002–2010 due to land subsidence. With a low subsidence rate, the rubble-mound-submerged breakwaters can reduce the shoreline retreat rate with a vertical deposition rate of about 5 cm/y. In contrast, use of a bamboo fence, a green solution widely used along muddy coasts, traps sediment at a rate of less than 1.3 cm/y and typically lasts only for 2–3 years after installation. Decomposed bamboo causes environmental degradation so local communities disapprove of the approach. Results reveal that grey solutions are more effective for stabilizing the ECPD coastline and result in less coastal environmental impact than the nature-based solution using a bamboo fence."

The effects of rotational disc speed (R), volumetric flow rate (Q) and disc surface on the liquid flow pattern, extraction efficiency (E) and overall mass transfer coefficient (kLa) were studied. Three disc surface types were considered including 1) smooth disc, 2) roughness A disc (metal sandpaper P36), and 3) roughness B disc (metal sandpaper P24). The highest values of E and kLa were 69.7% and 9.59 s−1 when using the roughness B disc surface operated at R of 1000 rpm and Q of 5 mL/s. A 3D-multiphase CFD model was applied to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics in the SDR for further understanding of the mass transfer performance in the SDR. The dissipation rate (ε) and micromixing time (tm) were proposed to compare the turbulent degree of each disc surface. The mass transfer performance was significantly enhanced by using the metal sandpaper as the disc surface. In addition, the metal sandpaper disc surface has a great ability to reduce energy consumption in comparison with the smooth disc surface."

Aerosol-generating procedures such as endoscopy, a common investigation tool for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, are recognised as a likely cause of SARS-CoV-2 spread in hospitals. Plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA is considered the most accurate biomarker for the routine management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A consensus statement on whether plasma EBV DNA can minimise the need for or replace aerosol-generating procedures, imaging methods, and face-to-face consultations in managing nasopharyngeal carcinoma is urgently needed amid the current pandemic and potentially for future highly contagious airborne diseases or natural disasters. We completed a modified Delphi consensus process of three rounds with 33 international experts in otorhinolaryngology or head and neck surgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and clinical oncology with vast experience in managing nasopharyngeal carcinoma, representing 51 international professional societies and national clinical trial groups. These consensus recommendations aim to enhance consistency in clinical practice, reduce ambiguity in delivering care, and offer advice for clinicians worldwide who work in endemic and non-endemic regions of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, in the context of COVID-19 and other airborne pandemics, and in future unexpected settings of severe resource constraints and insufficiency of personal protective equipment."
"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","Effect of neonatal reticulocytosis on glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and G6PD deficiency detection: a cross-sectional study  2022, The Author(s).Background: Screening for G6PD deficiency in newborns can help prevent severe hemolysis, hyperbilirubinemia, and bilirubin encephalopathy, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). It has been speculated that the presence of a high number of reticulocytes in newborns interferes with the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency since reticulocytes contain higher amounts of G6PD enzyme than mature erythrocytes. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to assess the effect of reticulocytosis in the determination of blood G6PD activity in Thai newborns by using a novel automated UV-based enzymatic assay and to validate the performance of this assay for the detection of G6PD deficiency in newborn samples. Methods: The levels of reticulocytes and G6PD activity were measured in blood samples collected from 1,015 newborns. G6PD mutations were identified using TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay, PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP), and direct sequencing. The correlation between the levels of reticulocytes and G6PD activity was examined. The performance of the automated method was compared with that of the fluorescent spot test (FST) and the standard quantitative assay. Results: The automated assay detected G6PD deficiency in 6.5% of the total newborn subjects compared to 5.3% and 6.1% by the FST and the standard method, respectively. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of G6PD ViangchanG871A, G6PD MahidolG487A, and G6PD UnionC1360T were 0.066, 0.005, and 0.005, respectively. The reticulocyte counts in newborns with G6PD deficiency were significantly higher than those in normal male newborns (p < 0.001). Compared with normal newborns after controlling for thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies, G6PD-deficient patients with the G6PD ViangchanG871A mutation exhibited elevated reticulocyte counts (5.82 ± 1.73%, p < 0.001). In a group of G6PD normal newborns, the percentage of reticulocytes was positively correlated with G6PD activity (r = 0.327, p < 0.001). However, there was no correlation between G6PD activity and the levels of reticulocytes in subjects with G6PD deficiency (r = -0.019, p = 0.881). The level of agreement in the detection of G6PD deficiency was 0.999, while the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve demonstrated that the automated method had 98.4% sensitivity, 99.5% specificity, 92.4% positive predictive value (PPV), 99.9% negative predictive value (NPV), and 99.4% accuracy. Conclusions: We report that reticulocytosis does not have a statistically significant effect on the detection of G6PD deficiency in newborns by both qualitative and quantitative methods."
['Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design'],"Physically Based Shape Matching  2023 Nvidia. Computer Graphics Forum  2023 Eurographics - The European Association for Computer Graphics and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The shape matching method is a popular approach to simulate deformable objects in interactive applications due to its stability and simplicity. An important feature is that there is no need for a mesh since the method works on arbitrary local groups within a set of particles. A major drawback of shape matching is the fact that it is geometrically motivated and not derived from physical principles which makes calibration difficult. The fact that the method does not conserve volume can yield visual artifacts, e.g. when a tire is compressed but does not bulge. In this paper we present a new meshless simulation method that is related to shape matching but derived from continuous constitutive models. Volume conservation and stiffness can be specified with physical parameters. Further, if the elements of a tetrahedral mesh are used as groups, our method perfectly reproduces FEM based simulations."

The effect of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducing agent during the Au catalyst preparation was studied. Characterization by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy established that an optimal NaBH4 quantity provided small Au NPs of less than 5 nm diameter with a uniform distribution that exhibited a higher catalytic activity than the others in the OSRM. The Au-CuO catalysts formed with different metal atomic ratios were also synthesized and compared for their catalytic activities in the OSRM and CO oxidation reactions with those from Au/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2. All Au-CuO catalysts achieved the highest methanol conversion at 400 °C, whereas the monometallic Au provided an almost five-fold higher catalytic CO oxidation activity due to the possession of smaller particles than in the other catalysts."

However, the crude oil price is high volatility, influenced by various factors and challenging to predict. Thus, various machine learning techniques have been proposed to predict crude oil prices for decades. In this study, we propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with different combinations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to improve the trend forecasting of crude oil prices for better trading signals compared to traditional strategies. As the crude oil price is a time series data, it is appropriate to apply CNN and LSTM for forecasting. The concept of our model is that CNN could detect features or patterns in different locations of time series data, while LSTM could maintain both short-term and long-term memory along with time series data. The collaboration of their abilities could help the neural network model understand complex relationships of historical data and trends of crude oil prices. Our study found that the combination of CNN and LSTM could significantly enhance trading performance in the long run."

An optimal blood pressure (BP) target to prevent AKI remains undetermined. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized clinical trial (RCT) results to address this knowledge gap. Methods: From inception to May 13, 2022, we searched Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, clinicaltrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP for RCTs comparing higher BP target versus normotension in hemodynamically unstable patients (shock, post-cardiac arrest, or surgery patients). The outcomes of interest were post-intervention AKI rate and renal replacement therapy (RRT) rate. Two investigators independently screened the citations and reviewed the full texts for eligible studies according to a predefined form. Results: Twelve trials were included, enrolling a total of 5759 participants, with shock, non-cardiac, and cardiac surgery patients accounting for 3282 (57.0%), 1687 (29.3%) and 790 (13.7%) patients, respectively. Compared to lower mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) targets that served as normotension, targeting higher MAP had no significant effect on AKI rates in shock (RR [95% CI] = 1.10 [0.93, 1.29]), in cardiac-surgery (RR [95% CI] = 0.87 [0.73, 1.03]) and non-cardiac surgery patients (RR [95% CI] = 1.25 [0.98, 1.60]) using random-effects meta-analyses. In shock patients with premorbid hypertension, however, targeting MAP above 70 mmHg resulted in significantly lower RRT risks, RR [95%CI] = 1.20 [1.03, 1.41], p < 0.05. Conclusions: Targeting a higher MAP in shock or perioperative patients may not be superior to normotension, except in shock patients with premorbid hypertension. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of a high MAP target to preventing AKI in hypertensive patients across common settings of hemodynamic instability.

However, its efficacy in comparison with periarticular anesthetic injection (PAI) alone has yet to be evaluated. Hence, we conducted a retrospective study to compare PAI and ACB + iPACK for controlling pain after TKA. Methods: Propensity scores, incorporating American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, body mass index, age, and sex, were used to match the ACB + iPACK group with the PAI group. All patients received the identical surgical technique and postoperative care. Outcome measures were visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, morphine consumption, knee flexion angle, straight leg raising (SLR), postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV), and length of stay (LOS) after the surgery. Results: After matching by propensity score, there were 49 patients with comparable demographic data in each group. The VAS and morphine requirements of the PAI and ACB + iPACK groups were not different during the first 48 hours after TKA. At 72 hours postoperatively, the VAS of the ACB + iPACK was 0.97 higher than that of the PAI group (p = 0.020). Knee flexion angle, SLR, PONV, and LOS were not significantly different between groups. No procedure-related complications were identified in either group. Conclusions: The anesthesiologist-administered ACB + iPACK was as effective as surgeon-administered PAI in controlling pain in the first 48 hours after TKA. However, the ACB + iPACK group had higher intensity of pain than did the PAI group at 72 hours after TKA."

QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) >450 ms in males and >460 ms in females was defined as QTc interval prolongation. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate factors associated with QTc interval prolongation.Results:Mean (standard deviation) age was 56 (5.5) years and 42% were female. The median current CD4+ was 619 (interquartile range [IQR] 487, 769) cells/mm3. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was 11.9 (IQR 7.1-16.1) years. Commonly used ART were rilpivirine (37.9%), efavirenz (20.1%), atazanavir/ritonavir (15.7%), lopinavir/ritonavir (12.3%) and dolutegravir (5%). The prevalence of QTc interval prolongation was 22.7%. In multivariable analysis, older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.12, P = 0.005), female sex (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01-2.82, P = 0.046) and increasing BMI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, P = 0.03) were associated with QTc interval prolongation. With every 1-year increase in age, the odds of QTc interval prolongation increased by 7%.Conclusions:In this well-suppressed aging Asian HIV cohort, the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation was relatively high, and associated with increasing age, female sex, and higher BMI. For PLWH with these characteristics, QTc interval should be monitored before and after initiating any medications known to prolong QTc intervals, to prevent fatal cardiac arrhythmias."

Methods: Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-utility of two modalities, stratified into five age groups based on the first modality taken at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 years old from government and societal perspectives. Input parameters related to clinical aspects and cost were obtained from 15 hospitals throughout Thailand and Thai Renal Replacement Therapy databases. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%, adjusted to 2021, and converted to USD (1 USD = 33.57 Thai Baht). One-way analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the uncertainty surrounding model parameters. Results: From the government perspective, compared to PD-first policy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was between 19,434 and 23,796 USD per QALY. Conversely, from a societal perspective, the ICER was between 31,913 and 39,912 USD per QALY. Both are higher than the willingness to pay threshold of 4,766 USD per QALY. Conclusion: By applying the updated real-practice data, PD-first policy still remains more cost-effective than HD-first policy at the current willingness to pay. However, HD gained more quality-adjusted life years than PD. This information will assist clinicians and policymakers in determining the future direction of dialysis modality selection and kidney replacement therapy reimbursement policies for ESKD patients."

In this study, a paper-based sensor containing green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (P-AgNPs) was developed for use in a smartphone in the determination of the H2O2 concentration. In the synthesis process, an extract of spent coffee grounds was used as a bioreducing agent. The effects of reaction time and silver nitrate (AgNO3) concentration on the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were investigated. The optimum conditions for the preparation of P-AgNPs were determined to be 100 mM AgNO3 (P-AgNPs-100) and 15 h synthesis time. The P-AgNPs-100 sensor exhibited high sensitivity with a detection limit of 1.26 mM H2O2, which might be suitable for the detection of H2O2-based household and beverage sanitizers. The H2O2 detection capability of P-AgNPs-100 was comparable to that of a commercial strip sensor. Furthermore, P-AgNPs-100 had a detection efficiency of more than 95% after long-term storage for 100 days."

The oxygen evolution reaction is one of way to achieve unlimited energy from water but the low stability, high energy required to drive the reaction (overpotential), complicated and unscalable synthesis method of expensive catalysis restricts its real time implementation into modern society. Herein this report, we suggested Ru-tailored hydrous cobalt phosphate and its concentration effect as a dopant to improve the catalytic properties. Electrocatalytic properties were studied via linear sweep voltammetry, chrono-potentiometric studies at a 10 mA/cm2 for 20 h, electrochemical active surface area, turnover frequency, and Tafel slope. Cobalt phosphate showed the connected-nanorods morphology, which is further tunned by increasing Ru-doping concentration, achieving various features from agglomerated nanorods sensitized with uniform nanoparticles on the micro-flower shapes consisting of interconnected nanorods sensitized with nanoparticles. The good electrocatalytic OER performance of 5% Ru-doped hydrous cobalt phosphate was achieved, exhibiting low overpotential up to 310 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA/cm2 besides a small Tafel slope of 62 mV/dec in 1 M KOH. As well, stable O2 evolution for a period of 20 h was shown. DFT calculation reveals that the Ru can increase electrical conductivity and promote OER activity, observed from Bader charge analysis, electron density difference, and OER Gibbs free energy. The EIS plot, ECSA, and TOF estimation disclose that the increased electrical conductivity, the improved ECSA, and the high intrinsic activity are together responsible for the good OER activity for 5%Ru–CoPO."
"['Microbiology (medical)', 'Infectious Diseases']","The clinical outcomes of high neutralizing antibodies titer convalescent plasma therapy in early developed severe COVID-19 patients; a case–control study  2022, The Author(s).Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes life-threatening pneumonia. Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) is expected to be the effective COVID-19 treatment for passive immunity. The high neutralizing antibodies titer of CPT is needed to prove the benefit in early developed severe COVID-19. Objective: This case–control study evaluated transfusion efficacy and adverse events with high-titer (≥ 1:320) COVID-19 convalescent plasma compared with standard care alone in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Among 107 severe COVID-19 patients, 55 received CPT plus standard care, and 52 received standard care alone. All-cause mortality was 15.3% in the CPT group compared with 85.4% in the standard care group (p < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed reduced mortality with CPT (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.07–0.31; p < 0.001 and HR 0.26; 95% CI 0.08–0.79; p = 0.018, respectively). CPT resulted in decreased use of mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, and high-flow oxygen requirement. Clinical and radiological outcomes improved. Conclusions: Immediate high neutralizing antibody titer CPT is safe and reduces mortality in early developed severe COVID-19 patients. The benefit of CPT in the early course of illness is challenging and requires additional study. Trial registration Thai clinical trials registry (TCTR) no. 20220101003."

This study investigates a newly formulated resins as an alternative 3D printing materials with tunable mechanical properties to expand the potential applications of advanced engineering products such as wearable devices and small reactors. A commercial acrylate-based resin was selected as a standard resin (STD). The resin was formulated by combining various volume ratios of a low-cost polypropylene glycol (PPG) having various molecular weights (400, 1000, and 2000 g/mol) with the STD resin. The printability of the formulated resins was optimized using the digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technique. The effects of the PPG contents on the properties of the printed parts were studied, including printability, thermal properties, mechanical properties, and thermo-mechanical properties. As a result, the formulated resins with 5–30%vol of PPG could be printed while higher PPG content led to print failure. Results suggest that increasing the PPG contents reduced the dimensional accuracy of the printed parts and decreased the mechanical properties, including the flexural strength, flexural modulus, impact strength, hardness, and elastic modulus. interestingly, at small loading, 5%vol, the mechanical performance of the printed specimens was successfully enhanced. These results are intriguing to use a tunable mechanical acrylate-based resin for a specific application such as a microreactor."

Dermatologic Therapy published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Secukinumab demonstrated high efficacy and favorable safety profile in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) in clinical trials. However, understanding of patient characteristics and clinical outcomes in real world in Thailand is still limited. To describe patient characteristics, effectiveness and safety of secukinumab in Thai PsO patients. This retrospective study analyzed data from medical records of adult PsO patients who initiated secukinumab at 7 dermatology centers from September 2017 to April 2021. Study outcomes included patient characteristics and changes in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline at weeks 4 and 16 after secukinumab initiation. Adverse events were recorded. Subgroup analyses by adherence rate and completeness of loading dose were performed. Of 163 patients, the mean (SD) age was 44.0 (14.0) years. Most patients (84.7%) were previously treated with topical therapy while 62.0% and 21.5% of patients had received systemic and biologic therapy, respectively. The mean baseline PASI score was 15.4 (9.3). Overall, the mean PASI score improved by 58.0% at week 4 and 78.4% at week 16. Statistically significant differences in PASI approvement were revealed among subgroups of patients with different loading dose and adherence rate. Adverse effects were reported in 8.0% of patients. The characteristics of patients in this study were slightly different from clinical trials in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as PsO treatment. Secukinumab was effective and safe in Thai patients with PsO, especially among those with complete loading dose and a higher adherence rate."

However, studies on composite separators with the aforementioned properties for aqueous electrolytes in Zn-ion batteries are limited. In this research, a polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/bio-based polyurethane (PU)/Ti3C2Tx MXene composite membrane was fabricated using an electrospinning technique. Ti3C2 MXene was embedded in fibers and formed a spindle-like structure. With Ti3C2Tx MXene, the electrolyte uptake and ionic conductivity reached the superior values of 2214% and 3.35 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. The composite membrane presented an excellent charge–discharge stability when assembled in a Zn//Zn symmetrical battery. Moreover, the developed separator exhibited a high flexibility and no dimensional and structural changes after heat treatment, which resulted in the high-performance separator for the Zn-ion battery. Overall, the PAN/bio-based PU/Ti3C2Tx MXene composite membrane can be potentially used as a high-performance separator for Zn-ion batteries."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Silver-enhanced colloidal gold dip strip immunoassay integrated with smartphone-based colorimetry for sensitive detection of cardiac marker troponin I  2022, The Author(s).Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a specific cardiac biomarker for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A sensitive and simple point-of-care test (POCT) is still required for early detection of AMI. To address this need, we developed a dip strip assay based on sandwich immunoassay coupled with a silver enhancement system. Pre-incubation and silver enhancement were introduced to the dip strip to increase sensitivity. Due to the catalytic reaction of the silver enhancement solution, the red color of AuNPs changed to dark brown as silver ions precipitated and enlarged the AuNPs. The obtained results were easily seen by the naked eye. For quantitative analysis, the color intensity of the results was analyzed using a smartphone with RGB color picker application. The effects of operating parameters (volume of AuNP-Ab conjugate, volume of sample, incubation time, and analysis time) were investigated and optimized. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) by the naked eye was 0.5 ng/mL. The LOD with silver enhancement was 50-fold lower than without. For quantitative analysis using the smartphone, linearity of detection was observed through the range of 0.5–50 ng/mL (R2 = 0.9952) and the LOD was 0.12 ng/mL. The developed method was successfully applied to detection of cTnI in serum samples, achieving analytical recoveries and %RSD in the ranges of 96.10–119.17% and 2.91–5.13%, respectively. Additionally, this developed assay was not cross reactive with the potentially interfering serum proteins. These results showed the great potential of this dip strip assay as an alternative POCT for detection of serum cTnI."
['Food Science'],"Extremely halophilic strains of Halobacterium salinarum as a potential starter culture for fish sauce fermentation  2022 Institute of Food Technologists.Proteinase-producing halophilic archaea were isolated from Thai fish sauce collected from industrial fermentation tanks at various periods of fermentation. Five isolates namely, J-1-S4, J-1-S13, J-1-S22, 2 m-40-15-R2, and P-1-S8, were identified as Halobacterium salinarum with slightly different colony and morphological characteristics among isolates. Starters of five isolates were prepared and added to the anchovy mixed with 25% solar salt and fermented for 180 days at 30–35°C. Halophilic bacteria/archaea counts of inoculated samples were decreased and undetected after 120 days of fermentation. At 180 days of fermentation, α-amino group contents of inoculated fish sauce samples (856–1010 mM) and total nitrogen content (2.2%–2.5%) were higher than the control without archaea inoculation (p < 0.05). All samples contained low amounts of biogenic amines, suggesting that all starters were not biogenic amine formers. The major volatile compound found in samples inoculated with H. salinarum P-1-S8 and H. salinarum 2 m-40-15-R2 was 3-methylbutanal, which contributes to the meaty note. Dimethyl disulfide, a compound that contributes to fecal note, was detected in all inoculated samples in a lower amount than in the commercial fish sauce (p < 0.05). Thus, H. salinarum accelerated protein hydrolysis and produced desirable volatile compounds during fish sauce fermentation in a strain-specific manner."

It is essential to develop methods of marking, identifying and monitoring tax classification of petroleum products in the market. In this work, a method for sensitive and fast detection of gasoline marker using paper-based platform and a smartphone camera detection are developed. A common dye, phenolphthalein (PhP), is used as a colorless dye marker in commercial gasoline. The color was developed by the interaction of PhP with NaOH on filter paper strips and evaluated by CMYK color systems. The newly developed counter-flowing technique, in which a gasoline sample containing PhP and NaOH solution are allowed to travel on a filter paper strip from the opposite end, gives the naked eye detection of PhP as low as 1 ppm with the limit of detection for a smartphone camera of 0.31 ppm. The high sensitivity is attributed to the preconcentration derived from accumulation of PhP at the immiscible liquid interface. The counter-flowing method can thus be a new facile analytical technique for enhancing chemical detection sensitivity."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Fluorescent silica nanoparticles as an internal marker in fruit flies and their effects on survivorship and fertility  2022, The Author(s).Tracking and differentiating small insects at the individual levels requires appropriate marking materials because of their small size. This study proposes and investigates the use of fluorescent silica nanoparticles (FSNPs) as an internal marker owing to their good optical properties and biocompatibility. FSNPs were prepared using the water-in-oil reverse microemulsion technique with Rubpy dye as a fluorophore. The obtained particles were spherical, monodispersed in nanosize and exhibited bright orange luminescence under ultraviolet (UV) light. Internal marking was accomplished in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) through feeding. The result shows that the fruit flies exhibit bright luminescence in their abdomen when exposed to UV light. The marking persistence duration of FSNPs in the fruit fly bodies is longer than those of other fluorescent dyes. Fruit flies fed with FSNPs have a longer lifespan than those fed with Rubpy dye. There was no difference in fertility and negative geotaxis response among the treatment and control groups. These findings demonstrate that FSNPs can be used as an internal marker in fruit flies, and are possibly applied with other small insects with a translucent abdomen."
['Gastroenterology'],"Risk factors of active upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of PPI prophylaxis  2022, The Author(s).Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is one of the most impactful complications in patients hospitalized from COVID-19 infection. Limited study has focused on patients with upper GI bleeding (UGIB). This study aimed to identify the risk factors of patients who were hospitalized from COVID-19 infection and developed UGIB as well as the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis in those patients. Methods: This study was comprised of two phases. The first phase was the retrospective enrollment of patients who were admitted due to COVID-19 infection and developed UGIB between April and August 2021 to evaluate the associated factors of active UGIB. The second phase was a retrospective analysis after PPI prophylaxis protocol from September – October 2021 to assess the benefit of PPI use in those patients. Results: Of 6,373 patients hospitalized, 43 patients (0.7%) had evidence of UGIB. The majority were male 28 (65.1%) with a mean age of 69.1 ± 11.8 years. Twenty-four of 43 patients (55.8%) needed mechanical ventilation, 35 patients (81.4%) received systemic corticosteroids, and 10 patients (23.3%) were taking anticoagulants for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis. Seven of 43 patients (16%) had active UGIB. There was no significant difference in the number of patients taking antiplatelets, anticoagulants, or steroids and the severity of COVID-19 infection between the two groups. An emergency endoscopy or endoscopic hemostasis were performed in 6/7 (85.7%) patients. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed two significant factors associated with active UGIB including higher of Glasgow-Blatchford score (GBS) per point (OR = 7.89; 95%CI 1.03–72.87; p = 0.04) and an absence of PPI use (OR 4.29; 95%CI 1.04–19.51; p = 0.04). After prescribing PPI as a prophylaxis, there was a slightly lower incidence of UGIB (0.6% vs 0.7%) in addition to an absence of active UGIB (0% vs 16%). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the absence of PPI and higher GBS were significant risk factors for active UGIB which required therapeutic endoscopy in patients with COVID-19 infection. We suggest that short-term PPI prophylaxis should be prescribed in those patients once they need hospitalization regardless of the severity of COVID-19 infection to minimize the severity of UGIB."

This study aimed to determine the clinical profiles, investigations, and outcomes of pediatric patients who had undergone parotidectomy. Methods: A multicenter retrospective review of parotidectomy in pediatric patients between 2007 and 2020. Results: In 108 parotidectomies, the final diagnoses were benign (47.22%), malignant (36.11%), and non-neoplastic (16.67%). The incidence of facial palsy was 37.03%, which was significantly lower in the superficial group than that in the total parotidectomy group (p =.021). The incidence of facial nerve palsy was significantly higher in the malignancy group than that in the benign group (p =.035). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected malignancy with 92.8% overall accuracy, 83.3% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were 54.2% and 92.7%, respectively. Conclusions: Parotidectomy is commonly performed for benign and non-neoplastic diseases in pediatric patients. Facial nerve palsy is significantly associated with malignant tumors and total parotidectomy. MRI is the most accurate imaging modality for diagnosing malignant lesions. FNA exhibits moderate agreement with the final pathology. Level of Evidence: Level IV."

ChulaCov19 is a prefusion non-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein-encoding, nucleoside-modified mRNA, lipid nanoparticle encapsulated vaccine that we report to be stable when stored at 2–8 °C for up to 3 months. Here we report safety and immunogenicity data from a phase I open-label, dose escalation, first-in-human trial of the ChulaCov19 vaccine (NCT04566276). Seventy-two eligible volunteers, 36 of whom were aged 18–55 (adults) and 36 aged 56–75 (elderly), were enroled. Two doses of vaccine were administered 21 d apart at 10, 25 or 50 μg per dose (12 per group). The primary outcome was safety and the secondary outcome was immunogenicity. All three dosages of ChulaCov19 were well tolerated and elicited robust dose-dependent and age-dependent B- and T-cell responses. Transient mild/moderate injection site pain, fever, chills, fatigue and headache were more common after the second dose. Four weeks after the second dose, in the adult cohort, MicroVNT-50 geometric mean titre against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 was 848 (95% CI, 483–1,489), 736 (459–1,183) and 1,140 (854–1,522) IU ml−1 at 10, 25 and 50 μg doses, respectively, versus 285 (196–413) IU ml−1 for human convalescent sera. All dose levels elicited 100% seroconversion, with geometric mean titre ratios 4–8-fold higher than for human convalescent sera (P < 0.01), and high IFNγ spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The 50 μg dose induced better cross-neutralization against Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants than lower doses. ChulaCov19 at 50 μg is well tolerated and elicited higher neutralizing antibodies than human convalescent sera, with strong T-cell responses. These antibodies cross-neutralized four variants of concern. ChulaCov19 has proceeded to phase 2 clinical trials. We conclude that the mRNA vaccine expressing a prefusion non-stabilized spike protein is safe and highly immunogenic."
"['Reproductive Medicine', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']","Survey of knowledge and attitude regarding induced abortion among nurses in a tertiary hospital in Thailand after amendment of the abortion act: a cross-sectional study  2022, The Author(s).Background: The abortion act in Thailand is approximately 60 years old. However, because of increasing problems due to unsafe abortions, the act was recently amended to accord a legal status for abortions. In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, most people follow the Islamic faith, according to which induced abortion is a sin for both the providers and the pregnant women. This may affect the attitude of the medical staff, such as registered nurses, who play an important role in abortion services. Our study aims to evaluate the knowledge of the amended abortion act, attitude toward abortions and the intentions behind them, and willingness to perform abortions among registered nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2022 to February 2022 wherein a self-administrated questionnaire was electronically distributed to 450 registered nurses practicing at a tertiary hospital in the southernmost province of Thailand. Linear regression analysis and Fisher’s exact test were conducted to evaluate the association between basic characteristics, knowledge scores, and attitudes toward induced abortion. Results: A total of 375 nurses (83.3%) completed the survey. Most participants were Muslim (58.9%), and 18.7% of them correctly answered > 80% of the knowledge questions. Among all the participants, 41.4% had a favorable attitude toward induced abortion, of which 21.3% were willing to provide safe abortion services. Knowledge scores were independently associated with practicing in obstetrics-gynecology departments and a lower age. Participants practicing Buddhism and having good knowledge scores tended to have favorable attitudes toward abortion. Conclusions: Nurses in the southernmost province of Thailand lack knowledge regarding the amended abortion act and do not have a favorable moral attitude toward abortion. Favorable attitudes toward abortions, support toward intentions behind abortions, and a willingness to provide abortion services were all lesser among the Muslim participants than among the Buddhist participants. Compared with participants who scored lower, those with higher knowledge scores had a better moral attitude toward abortion and, in turn, demonstrated a greater intention to provide abortion services. Encouraging nurses to gain better knowledge may improve their attitude toward abortion, which may positively influence future medical practices."

Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and Scopus to determine the worldwide prevalence of HCV infection, risk factors, and clinical outcomes among hemodialysis patients. Random-effect models and meta-regressions were used to generate pooled estimates and assess heterogeneity. Results: Four hundred and seven studies with 1,302,167 participants were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of HCV infection was 21%. The highest prevalence was observed in Africa (28%) and low-income countries (48.5%). A significant prevalence decline was observed following the publication year and was also inversely related to GDP and total population of each country. Factors associated with HCV positivity included younger age, longer dialysis duration, more blood transfusions, and dialyzer reuse. The pooled unadjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.12 (95% CI 1.03–1.22), and the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.21 (95% CI 1.12–1.30) in HCV-infected compared to non-HCV infected patients. Conclusions: HCV infection among hemodialysis patients is a worldwide shared burden and is associated with a higher risk of death. Avoiding unnecessary blood transfusion and dialyzer reuse should be encouraged to prevent HCV transmission in hemodialysis units."

This study evaluated the cytotoxicity of MG and its derivatives as well as determined the mechanism(s) underlying the cytotoxic activity of the most potent MG derivative on two CRC cell lines, HCT-116 cells carrying p53 wild-type and HT-29 cells carrying p53 mutant. We found that MG and its derivatives could inhibit viability of HCT-116 and HT-29 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Of all semi-synthetic derivatives of MG, allyl ether mansonone G (MG7) was the most potent cytotoxic agent toward cancer cells and less toxic to normal cells. MG7 could induce ROS generation which was associated with cytotoxicity and apoptosis in both HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that MG7 downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins in both CRC cell lines and upregulated the expression of BAK protein in HT-29 cells. Moreover, MG7 inhibited AKT signaling pathway in both CRC cell lines and modulated ERK1/2 signaling pathway by inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HCT-116 cells and activating ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HT-29 cells. Molecular docking revealed that MG7 could bind to the ATP-binding pocket of AKT and ERK1 via hydrophobic interactions."

The gut microbiota has essential roles in host physiology. Therefore, discovering host-parasite–microbiota interactions could help develop alternative helminthiasis treatments. Additionally, these interactions are modulated by functional metabolites that can reveal the mechanisms of infection and disease progression. Thus, we aimed to investigate bacteriomes in the gut of helminths and fecal samples of patients via next-generation sequencing. Our results showed that infection intensity was associated with the bacterial composition of helminth guts but not with the intestinal bacteriome of human hosts. Moreover, the metabolomes of A. lumbricoides in the heavy and light ascariasis cases were characterized using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Increased levels of essential biomolecules, such as amino acids, lipids, and nucleotide precursors, were found in the guts of helminths isolated from heavily infected patients, implying that these metabolites are related to egg production and ascariasis pathogenicity. These findings are the first step towards a more complete understanding of the mechanisms by which the bacteriome of helminth guts affect their colonization and may reveal novel and more effective approaches to parasitic disease therapy."

Methods: Serum samples were collected from 302 mothers and 291 children between 2015 and 2021. Maternal and cord blood were collected at birth. Serial serum samples of children were collected at the ages of 2, 7, 18, 19, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months and the presence of anti-RSV immunoglobulin G (IgG) was tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The cord: maternal serum antibody ratio was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.11). Although >90% of babies at birth were seropositive through transplacental transfer, antibody levels gradually declined, with the highest seronegative rate (91.9%) at 7 months of age. Subsequently, anti-RSV IgG levels increased with age, most likely due to natural infection. One-third of the children showed evidence of reinfection as determined by seroconversion of anti-RSV IgG or increased titers of at least 50 relative units/ml. Conclusion: Waning of RSV antibodies in infants is rapid, and RSV infection subsequently increases anti-RSV IgG titers. RSV vaccination in children before the age of 7 months should be recommended."

All rights reserved.OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of cannabidiol on orofacial nociception induced by Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) in male Mus musculus mice. DESIGN: For the study of efficacy, mice were divided into seven groups: sham; inflammation; and cannabidiol 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg. For the study of mechanisms of cannabidiol, mice were divided into six groups: sham, inflammation, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist with and without cannabidiol, and vanilloid receptor 1 antagonist with and without cannabidiol. Spontaneous pain-like behaviors, trigeminal nociception, and trigeminal modulating activity were investigated. RESULTS: CFA injected in the right masseter muscle significantly induced spontaneous pain-like behaviors and the trigeminal nociceptive pathway. This effect was inhibited by injection of 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg of cannabidiol. The 50 % inhibitory concentration of cannabidiol on antinociception was found to be 3 mg/kg. In addition, there was no difference in spontaneous pain-like behaviors with vanilloid receptor 1 antagonist injected before treatment with cannabidiol compared to saline control. Reduced c-fos expression was observed in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and periaqueductal gray in the group injected with CGRP antagonist before treatment with cannabidiol. CONCLUSION: The antinociceptive effects of cannabidiol induced by acute orofacial nociception is mediated by vanilloid receptor 1 but not by CGRP. Cannabidiol can act with peripheral nonpeptidergic neurons and can be used as an alternative drug or as a synergistic medication in pain treatment."

The mucosal innate immune system is the first line of defense against viral infection. The modulatory effect of PDCoV and PEDV coinfection on antiviral signaling cascades of the intestinal mucosa has not been reported. Here, we investigate the gene expression levels of pattern recognition receptors, downstream inflammatory signaling pathway molecules, and associated cytokines on the intestinal mucosa of neonatal piglets either infected with a single- or co-infected with PDCoV and PEDV using real-time PCR. The results demonstrate that single-PEDV regulates the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway through RIG-I regulation. In contrast, single-PDCoV and PDCoV/PEDV coinfection regulate proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines through TRAF6-mediated canonical NF-κB and IRF7 signaling pathways through TLRs. Although PDCoV/PEDV coinfection demonstrated an earlier modulatory effect in these signaling pathways, the regulation of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines was observed simultaneously during single viral infection. These results suggested that PDCoV/PEDV coinfection may have synergistic effects that lead to enhanced viral evasion of the mucosal innate immune response."

This study reveals the diverse bacterial communities of marine sponges collected from the Thailand coast by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Functional predictions using Tax4Fun2 indicated that the sponge bacterial communities have the potential for crude oil degradation. In this work, two nonpathogenic crude oil-degrading bacteria, Sphingobium naphthae MO2-4 and Bacillus aryabhattai TL01-2, isolated from the sponges Chalinula sp. and Clathria reinwardti, respectively, were selected to construct a bacterial consortium named MOTL. The results showed that the strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 had biosurfactant producing abilities and each had the ability to adhere to hydrocarbons. These strains also demonstrated capacities for surviving in the presence of various heavy metals. Moreover, strain MO2-4 contained genes encoding hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes. Consortium MOTL achieved 64%, 63%, and 51% degradation efficiencies for 2000 mg L-1 crude oil, diesel oil, and fuel oil, respectively, within 7 days and still maintained its degradation capacity when the concentration of petroleum oil increased to 8000 mg L-1. The consortium could degrade phenanthrene, tetradecane and a mixture of phenanthrene and tetradecane, and its degradation efficiencies were more effective than those of the individual strains. Consequently, the consortium MOTL is a promising candidate for the full-scale application of petroleum bioremediation in the presence of heavy metals."

Recent research suggests that FOG may result from dysfunctional plantar peripheral sensory systems. The impact of combined plantar pressure and vibratory stimulation over vibratory or pressure alone on FOG remains unexplored. Methods: PD patients with FOG were randomised into four groups and treated with combined vibratory and pressure stimulation, vibratory stimulation alone, pressure stimulation alone, or controls (no stimulation). Vibratory stimulation targeted both Achilles' tendons. Simultaneous bilateral pressure stimulation was applied to the first hallux, first metatarsal bone, and the sole. The primary outcome included normalized percent changes in percent FOG measured both pre- and immediately post-stimulation. Other outcomes including clinical rating scale, response to questionnaires, number and duration of freezing episodes, and spatiotemporal gait parameters at pre- and freezing episodes were also explored. Results: Sixty PD patients participated in the study. Patients who were treated with combined vibratory and pressure stimulation responded with significant decreases in normalized percent changes of percent FOG (62.75 ± 25.54%, p < 0.001) compared with those treated with vibration alone (11.38 ± 8.29%, p < 0.001), pressure alone (15.15 ± 16.18%, p < 0.001), or controls (8.59 ± 16.85%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the benefit of combined vibratory and pressure stimulation on FOG suggesting that this strategy might be developed as a novel treatment modality for PD patients with FOG."
"['Biotechnology', 'Biochemistry', 'Molecular Biology', 'Cell Biology']","Detection of m6A from direct RNA sequencing using a multiple instance learning framework  2022, The Author(s).RNA modifications such as m6A methylation form an additional layer of complexity in the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing can capture this information in the raw current signal for each RNA molecule, enabling the detection of RNA modifications using supervised machine learning. However, experimental approaches provide only site-level training data, whereas the modification status for each single RNA molecule is missing. Here we present m6Anet, a neural-network-based method that leverages the multiple instance learning framework to specifically handle missing read-level modification labels in site-level training data. m6Anet outperforms existing computational methods, shows similar accuracy as experimental approaches, and generalizes with high accuracy to different cell lines and species without retraining model parameters. In addition, we demonstrate that m6Anet captures the underlying read-level stoichiometry, which can be used to approximate differences in modification rates. Overall, m6Anet offers a tool to capture the transcriptome-wide identification and quantification of m6A from a single run of direct RNA sequencing."

This study investigates the effects of root growth and decay on the changes in root biomechanical properties and the shearing behaviour of vegetated soils. Columns of compacted soils were grown with a grass species, Cynodon dactylon. The grass was grown for 6 months, followed by burning or herbicide applications to introduce root decay. The top part of each column was used for direct shear tests, whilst the roots collected from the bottom part were used for the measurements of root tensile and chemical properties. The vegetated soils displayed greater shear strength and larger dilatancy, which were attributable to the growth-induced increase in the root cellulose content, and thus the root tensile strength and modulus. Root decay, upon burning or herbicide use, caused significant declines in the root tensile properties, which translated to the reductions in soil dilatancy and soil shear strength lower than those of the fallow soil. Herbicide use introduced a much faster and significant loss of root reinforcement than burning because of the more severe decay and loss of root biomechanical properties."
"['Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics']","Bite Force Performance from wild Derived mice has Undetectable Heritability Despite Having Heritable Morphological Components  2022, The Author(s).Fitness-related traits tend to have low heritabilities. Conversely, morphology tends to be highly heritable. Yet, many fitness-related performance traits such as running speed or bite force depend critically on morphology. Craniofacial morphology correlates with bite performance in several groups including rodents. However, within species, this relationship is less clear, and the genetics of performance, morphology and function are rarely analyzed in combination. Here, we use a half-sib design in outbred wild-derived Mus musculus to study the morphology-bite force relationship and determine whether there is additive genetic (co-)variance for these traits. Results suggest that bite force has undetectable additive genetic variance and heritability in this sample, while morphological traits related mechanically to bite force exhibit varying levels of heritability. The most heritable traits include the length of the mandible which relates to bite force. Despite its correlation with morphology, realized bite force was not heritable, which suggests it is less responsive to selection in comparison to its morphological determinants. We explain this paradox with a non-additive, many-to-one mapping hypothesis of heritable change in complex traits. We furthermore propose that performance traits could evolve if pleiotropic relationships among the determining traits are modified."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Application of shear stress for enhanced osteogenic differentiation of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells  2022, The Author(s).The self-organizing potential of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represents a promising tool for bone tissue engineering. Shear stress promotes the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, leading us to hypothesize that specific shear stress could enhance the osteogenic differentiation of iPSCs. For osteogenesis, embryoid bodies were formed for two days and then maintained in medium supplemented with retinoic acid for three days, followed by adherent culture in osteogenic induction medium for one day. The cells were then subjected to shear loading (0.15, 0.5, or 1.5 Pa) for two days. Among different magnitudes tested, 0.5 Pa induced the highest levels of osteogenic gene expression and greatest mineral deposition, corresponding to upregulated connexin 43 (Cx43) and phosphorylated Erk1/2 expression. Erk1/2 inhibition during shear loading resulted in decreased osteogenic gene expression and the suppression of mineral deposition. These results suggest that shear stress (0.5 Pa) enhances the osteogenic differentiation of iPSCs, partly through Cx43 and Erk1/2 signaling. Our findings shed light on the application of shear-stress technology to improve iPSC-based tissue-engineered bone for regenerative bone therapy."

This research aims to consider the possibility of the synthesis, characteristics, and catalytic activity of the different mesoporous carbon materials (SBA-15-C, MCF-C, KIT-6-C, and TMS-C) derived from the corresponding mesoporous silica materials (SBA-15, MCF, KIT-6, and TMS). Methods: Mesoporous silica-based materials such as SBA-15, TMS, MCF, and KIT-6 were straightly synthesized and transformed as silica-based materials to mesoporous carbon-based materials denoted as SBA-15/C, TMS/C, MCF/C, and KIT-6/C using the surfactant residue with sulfuric acid as sulfonation process in order to enhance the physicochemical properties. In addition, these carbon catalysts were compared up on characteristics and catalytic performance towards ethanol dehydrogenation to convert ethanol into acetaldehyde. Significant findings: It revealed that these mesoporous silica-based materials were successfully converted to the promising mesoporous carbon-based materials having appropriate physicochemical properties including acid-base properties owing to the significant existence of the carbon source. The MCF/C exhibited remarkable catalytic activity than any other carbon materials on ethanol dehydrogenation. Moreover, MCF/C is also stable toward ethanol dehydrogenation along the extensive time of the operation with behavioral recyclability. Thus, MCF/C is captivating as a potential catalyst for ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde owing to the appropriate physicochemical characteristic of the well-defined mesoporous carbon catalyst"

A high concentration of protease inhibitors was observed in the Thai people living with HIV (PLWH). Thus, dose reduction of LPV/r may be possible. However, the pharmacokinetics and dose optimization of LPV/r have never been investigated. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of LPV/r and provide dosage optimization in Thai PLWH. Methods: LPV and RTV trough concentrations from Thai PLWH were combined with intensive data. The data were analyzed by the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. The influence of RTV concentration on LPV oral clearance (CL/F) was investigated. Results: Rifampicin (RIF) use increased LPV and RTV CL/F by 2.16-fold and 1.99-fold, respectively. The reduced dose of 300/75 and 200/150 mg twice daily provided a comparable percentage of patients achieving LPV target trough concentration to the standard dose for PI-naïve patients. For HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving RIF who could not tolerate the recommended dose, the reduced dose of 600/150 mg twice daily was recommended. Conclusion: The population pharmacokinetic model was developed by integrating the interaction between LPV and RTV. The reduced LPV/r dosage offers sufficient LPV exposure for Thai PLWH."

Design: A total of 404 subjects, 202 knee OA subjects and 202 healthy volunteers, were enrolled into the study. Four distinct polymorphisms of the VEGFA gene were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism: −2578C/A (rs699947), −1154G/A (rs1570360), −634C/G (rs2010963), and +936C/T (rs3025039). Plasma VEGFA levels were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The most common nucleotides in both knee OA subjects and healthy controls were CC for −2578C/A, GG for −1154G/A, CG for −634C/G, and CC for +936C/T in the VEGFA gene. Genotype distribution and allele frequencies of VEGFA −2578C/A, −1154G/A, −634C/G, and +936C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ between OA patients and the controls. Plasma VEGFA levels showed no difference between OA patients and the controls. In contrast, plasma VEGFA levels of −634C/C genotype were significantly higher in OA patients than in the controls (P = 0.035). According to the −2578A/A genotype, patients with early stage OA had a higher odds ratio than those with advanced stage OA (P = 0.023). Conclusions: VEGFA −2578C/A (rs699947), −1154G/A (rs1570360), −634C/G (rs2010963), and +936C/T (rs3025039) polymorphisms may not be responsible for OA susceptibility in the Thai population. However, the OA patients with A/A genotype at the −2578C/A seemed to have a lower potential risk of developing severe OA than those with the C/A and C/C genotypes. These findings would help elucidate and facilitate a better understanding of the genetic fundamentals of OA."

We aimed to determine an association between CTCs and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Peripheral blood was obtained from 73 HCC patients to enumerate for epithelial CTCs/8 mL blood. CTCs were detected by immunoaffinity-based method using epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and mucin1 (MUC1). The CTCs detection rates of BCLC stages A, B, and C patients were 65.4% (17/26), 77.3% (17/22), and 96% (24/25), respectively, p = 0.018. Patients with CTCs < 5 cells/8 mL had significantly longer survival than those with CTCs ≥ 5 cells/8 mL (>36 vs. 4.6 months, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, CTP B, BCLC B, BCLC C, AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL, and CTC ≥ 5 cells/8 mL were independently associated with survival, with adjusted HRs (95%CI) of 4.1 (2.0–8.4), 3.5 (1.1–11.4), 4.7 (1.4–15.4), 2.4 (1.1–5.0), and 2.6 (1.2–8.4); p < 0.001, 0.036, 0.011, 0.025 and 0.012, respectively.

The mixture of exfoliated GO and HA was mixed at the time of gelation of PVA to produce PVA-HA-GO homogenous solution. The SF solution was mixed into the PVA-HA-GO homogenous solution to produce gray color gel and cast on Petri dishes to produce PSHG biomaterial. The prepared PSHG biomaterials were subjected to biochemical test assays like hemolysis, protein adsorption, platelet aggregation, and blood clotting ability. The PSHG-based biomaterials biocompatibility was ascertained using Human skin fibroblast (HSK) cell lines. The results suggested that the prepared PSHG biomaterial has high absorption ability (∼1040 %), hemolysis (∼2.38 %), platelets aggregation (∼35 %), protein loading (∼30 mg/cm2), and ∼ 89 % blood clot within 15 s. Moreover, PSHG-based biomaterials significantly improved the number of fibroblast cells with high biocompatibility and controlled blood loss.

There are different approaches to delineating GWPZ, and each has unique advantages and disadvantages. Incorporating these approaches into an ensemble could provide a more efficient tool for GWPZ evaluation and mapping. In this study, the frequency ratio (FR), random forest (RF), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) models, and their ensemble were compared in delineating GPWZs in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. These models predicted the potential of groundwater yield at > 10 m3/h and were trained based on the measured groundwater yield of 1,601 wells in the study region, coupled with the spatial data of eight influencing factors, including altitude, distance to faults, distance to waterbodies, geology, land use, rainfall, soil type, and slope. The Areas under the curve (AUC) metric was used to assess the model's performance. The results demonstrated that all models achieved similarly good performance with an AUC of 0.80, 0.76, 0.74, and 0.72 for the ensemble, RF, FR, and AHP models, respectively. Areas with high groundwater yield potential were primarily reported in the eastern part of Kanchanaburi, where the terrain is flat.

Benthic microalgae, in contrast to the phytoplankton that is able to be transported by currents, have limited dispersal ability and thus are a better ecological indicator to climate changes. Here we performed sampling in the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and South China Sea and established twenty-six strains of benthic Prorocentrum for detailed morphological and molecular examinations. Five Prorocentrum species, including P. concavum, P. fukuyoi, P. mexicanum, P. tsawwassenense, and P. cf. sculptile, were identified.

We speculated that protein expression on circulating T-lymphocytes represent T-lymphocyte trafficking before infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. The possibility of using protein expression on circulating T-lymphocytes as a biomarker to discriminate early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was explored. Four independent PBMC gene expression microarray datasets (GSE12771, GSE13255, GSE20189 and GSE3934) were analyzed. We selected C5AR1, CLEC4A and NLRP3 based on their significant protein expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, but not in normal lymphoid tissue. A validation study using automated flow cytometry was conducted in 141 study participants including 76 treatment-naive early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC), 12 individuals with non-malignant pulmonary diseases, and 53 healthy individuals. Median ratios of C5AR1, CLEC4A and NLRP3 specific antibody staining to CD3 positive cells in early-stage NSCLC patients compared to healthy controls were 0.014 [0–0.37] vs. 0.01 [0–0.07, p = 0.13], 0.03 [0–0.87] vs. 0.02 [0–0.13, p = 0.10] and 0.19 [0–0.60] vs. 0.09 [0.02–0.31, p < 0.0001], respectively. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD3+C5AR1+, CD3+CLEC4A+ and CD3+NLRP3+ expression in early-stage NSCLC patients compared to healthy volunteers was 185 [64.2–4801] vs. 107.5 [27–229, p < 0.0001], 91.2 [42.4–2355] vs. 71.25 [46.2–103, p = 0.0005], and 1585 [478–5224] vs. 758.5 [318–1976, p < 0.0001], respectively. NLRP3:CD3 ratio, CD3+C5AR1+, CD3+CLEC4A+ and CD3+NLRP3+ MFI were significantly higher in early-stage NSCLC than healthy volunteers with an area under the ROC curve of 0.69–0.76. The CD3+NLRP3+ MFI provided the most distinguishable expression at 71.5% sensitivity and 70% specificity. Furthermore, CD3+NLRP3+ MFI potentially discriminated between early-stage NSCLC from malignant-mimic inflammation and infection pulmonary disease. Further validation in various pulmonary inflammatory disease might be warranted. Our proof-of-principle findings strengthen the hypothesis that malignancies generate distinctive protein expression fingerprints on circulating T-lymphocytes."

As such, significant forensic information could be obtained from high throughput sequencing of the human microbiome. This approach, combined with multiple analytical techniques demonstrates that bacterial DNA can be used to uniquely identify an individual and to provide information about their life and behavioral patterns. However, the transformation of these findings into actionable forensic information, including the geolocation of the samples, remains limited by incomplete understanding of the effects of confounding factors and the paucity of diverse sequences. We obtained 16S rRNA sequences of stool and oral microbiomes collected from 206 young and healthy females from four globally diverse populations, in addition to supporting metadata, including dietary and medical information. Analysis of these microbiomes revealed detectable geolocation signals between the populations, even for populations living within the same city.

Biocomposites had CO2 uptake rates of 1.57 ± 0.08 g CO2 g−1biomass d−1. Uptake rates were based on the dry biomass at the start of the trial and incorporate the CO2 used to grow new biomass as well as that contained in storage compounds such as carbohydrates. These uptake rates represent 14–20-fold improvements over suspension controls, potentially scaling to capture 570 tCO2 t−1biomass yr−1, with an equivalent land consumption of 5.5–8.17 × 106 ha, delivering annualized CO2 removal of 8–12 GtCO2, compared with 0.4–1.2 × 109 ha for forestry-based bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. The biocomposites remained functional for 12 weeks without additional nutrient or water supplementation, whereupon experiments were terminated.

Engagement of PD-1 with its ligand leads to the exhausted T cells and impaired antitumor immunity. To date, PD-1 expression and its roles have been widely reported in T cells but not well defined in innate immune cells including monocytes. In this study, expression of PD-1 was investigated in human monocytes. Here we observed that among cytokines tested, IFN-γ significantly upregulated the PD-1 expression in both THP-1 cell line and human primary monocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This effect was reduced by PI3K inhibitor, suggesting that the involvement of PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore, enrichment of active histone mark H3K4me3 in the Pdcd1 promotor was also observed in IFN-γ-induced THP-1, indicating that epigenetic regulation also plays a role in IFN-γ-induced PD-1 expression. To investigate the biological functions of PD-1, Pdcd1 was deleted in THP-1 cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 system and the phagocytic ability was investigated. The results showed that the PD-1 deficiency in THP-1 cell line resulted in significantly poor phagocytic potency against carboxylated-modified latex beads. Moreover, the PD-1 deficiency or blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by immune checkpoint inhibitor resulted in an impaired induction of IL-4-induced CD163 expression in THP-1 cell line. Taken together, these results highlighted the importance of PD-1 expression in some of key monocyte functions."

Vago was initially perceived to participate only in the antiviral activation through JAK/STAT pathway. However, certain isoforms of Vago can stimulate antimicrobial responses. Here we identify Vago isoforms in Fenneropenaeus merguiensis (FmVagos) and how they function in antiviral and antibacterial responses against highly invasive pathogens, including white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND). Three isoforms of FmVagos were identified: FmVago4, FmVago5a, and FmVago5b, and expressed throughout tissues of the shrimp. During infection, FmVago4, FmVago5a, and FmVago5b, were up-regulated after WSSV and VPAHPND challenges at certain time points. Pre-injection of purified recombinant FmVago4 (rVago4), FmVago5a (rVago5a), and FmVago5b (rVago5b) proteins could significantly reduce the mortality of shrimp upon WSSV infection, while the increase of survival rate of VPAHPND-infected shrimp was observed only in rVago4 treatment. The immunity routes that FmVagos might instigate in response to the pathogens were examined by qRT-PCR, revealing that the JAK/STAT pathway was activated after introducing rVago4, rVago5a, and rVago5b, while the Toll/IMD pathway and proPO system, combined with PO activity, were provoked only in the rVago4-treated shrimp. Our finding suggests cross-talk between Vago's antiviral and antimicrobial responses in shrimp immunity. These findings complement previous studies in which Vago and its specific isoform could promote viral and bacterial clearance in shrimp."

In this study, we investigate the extent to which the composition of Apis and stingless bee honeys has been a driver in the selection of different bee species for domestication in Mesoamerica (Mexico) and Asia (Thailand) using a sampling design that combines peak honey profiling by H1 NMR spectroscopy with the collection of honeys from domesticated and undomesticated bee species. Our results show that, independently of the region of the world considered, domesticated stingless bees produce honey whose compositional profiles differ from those of the non-domesticated species and exhibit more similarities towards honeys produced by the domesticated Apis species. Our results provide evidence for the first time that the search for natural sweeteners in the environment by our ancestors led to the parallel and independent domestication of social bees producing honeys with similar compositional profiles."

This study aimed to find out CKD prevalence of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria and their related risk factors in the rural community. A population-based study was conducted in the rural sub-districts of northeastern Thailand. Data of socio-demographic status, lifestyle, underlying diseases, blood pressure, and body mass index were recorded. Blood and urine analysis was conducted along with ultrasonography of kidneys. Specimen collection and analyses were repeated after 3 months, and the factors associated with CKD were studied by logistic regression analysis. A total of 2205 participants with a mean age of 57.8 ± 11.7 years and female predominance (66.7%) completed the study. The prevalence of CKD was 26.8%, i.e., stages 1 (7.3%); stage 2 (9.0%); stage 3a (6.0%); stage 3b (2.8%); stage 4 (1.4%); and stage 5 (0.3%). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal stones were the major underlying diseases. Only 3.5% of the participants were aware of having CKD. An increase in age, male, unemployment, current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, underweight, anemia, hyperuricemia, and leukocytosis were significantly associated factors with the disease. The study revealed that CKD has developed as a significant public health problem in rural northeastern Thailand and one out of every four people has CKD. Therefore, early interventions are essential for the proper management and prevention of CKD."

However, nationwide studies regarding this association in adolescents remain limited. This study aimed to explore the national prevalence of high blood pressure among Thai adolescents and to determine the association between sleep duration and high blood pressure. Methods: Data from adolescents aged 10–19 years from the Thai National Health and Examination Survey V were included. We collected demographic data (including age and gender), height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood chemistries and sleep duration data. Sleep durations were categorized as short, normal or long for each age group based on the United States National Sleep Foundation’s recommendations. High blood pressure was diagnosed using the 2017 guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Factors associated with high blood pressure were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 3505 adolescents (1785 female) were included. The prevalence of high blood pressure was 9.4% (95% CI 8.5–10.4%). The high blood pressure group had higher BMI z-score, LDL-C, triglyceride and lower HDL-C than the normotensive group. In the multivariate analysis, BMI z-score, LDL-C and HDL-C were independently associated with high blood pressure. However, there was no association between sleep duration and high blood pressure. Conclusions: High blood pressure risk was increased in adolescents with high BMI z-score. Neither short nor long sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure."

['Nephrology'],"The tryptophan catabolite or kynurenine pathway in major depressive and bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis  2022 The Author(s)Background: There is now evidence that affective disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are mediated by immune-inflammatory and nitro-oxidative pathways. Activation of these pathways may be associated with activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway by inducing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO, the rate-limiting enzyme) leading to depletion of tryptophan (TRP) and increases in tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). Aims: To systematically review and meta-analyze central and peripheral (free and total) TRP levels, its competing amino-acids (CAAs) and TRYCATs in MDD and BD. Methods: This review searched PubMed, Google Scholar and SciFinder and included 121 full-text articles and 15470 individuals, including 8024 MDD/BD patients and 7446 healthy controls. Results: TRP levels (either free and total) and the TRP/CAAs ratio were significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) in MDD/BD as compared with controls with a moderate effect size (standardized mean difference for TRP: SMD = −0.513, 95% confidence interval, CI: −0.611; −0.414; and TRP/CAAs: SMD = −0.558, CI: −0.758; −0.358). Kynurenine (KYN) levels were significantly decreased in patients as compared with controls with a small effect size (p < 0.0001, SMD = −0.213, 95%CI: −0.295; −0.131). These differences were significant in plasma (p < 0.0001, SMD = −0.304, 95%CI: −0.415, −0.194) but not in serum (p = 0.054) or the central nervous system (CNS, p = 0.771). The KYN/TRP ratio, frequently used as an index of IDO activity, and neurotoxicity indices based on downstream TRYCATs were unaltered or even lowered in MDD/BD. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that MDD and BD are accompanied by TRP depletion without IDO and TRYCAT pathway activation. Lowered TRP availability is probably the consequence of lowered serum albumin during the inflammatory response in affective disorders."

While keeping hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h, the system was operated with different horizontal flow velocities of 0.2,0.3 and 0.4 m/s. The performance and stability of the IT/OD-MBR system for biological nutrient removal and permeate flux was investigated. The results indicated that IT/OD-MBR system could achieve high performances for COD, ammonia and phosphorus removal efficiencies over 90%, 90% and 80%, respectively with the horizontal flow velocity at least 0.2 m/s. Moreover, the predominant foulant of microbial EPS was found to be lipid. For long-term system operation, the optimal horizontal flow velocity at least 0.3 m/s is recommended for the stable permeate flux and nutrient removal performance. High quality of treated effluent from the proposed hybrid IT/OD-MBR system could comply with the water reuse guideline for landscape and gardening purposes."

The highest H2 production rate of 55.80 ± 0.50 μmol H2 g dry weight−1 h−1 was obtained when the cells were incubated in BG110 medium containing 0.189 mmol C-atom L−1 glucose under dark anaerobic condition. This rate was 1.5 folds higher than that without glucose. Among ten reducing agents tested, β-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, L-cysteine and sodium sulfide had high potential as an effective reducing agent to increase H2 production by A. halophytica. Cells treated with 50 mM sodium sulfide showed the highest H2 accumulation with 4815.59 ± 194.78 μmol H2 g dry weight−1 after 24 h of dark anaerobic incubation. An increase in H2 production was ascribed to an increase of hydrogenase activity and a decrease of O2 production rate. This H2 production yield was approximately 20 folds higher than that without reducing agent. Furthermore, 50 mM sodium sulfide appeared to be non-toxic to A. halophytica cells, since the IC50 of sodium sulfide was higher than 100 mM. The reduced ferredoxin at 1.5 μM-1.5 mM, NADH and NADPH at 0.15–1.5 mM could support in vitro [NiFe]-H2ase activity, demonstrating the ability of these compounds to provide electrons towards [NiFe]-H2ase in A. halophytica."

However, using only a battery cannot cope with the long-term power demand. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been considered one of the most promising backup power supplies for household applications. Therefore, the photovoltaic and solar thermal collector system incorporated with battery and DMFC is proposed along with the energy management system. In this study, a neural network-based adaptive control is developed to control the DMFC to meet persistent residential power demand and follow the technical requirements. Simulation results show that the neural network-based control outperforms the proportional-integral-derivative control in set-point change, disturbance, and model mismatch cases. Implementing the controlled DMFC in the hybrid system results in lower power requirements from the grid, which is less than twice that of a hybrid system without the DMFC. Furthermore, when solar power was insufficient to supply the load demand, the battery lifecycle in the system integrated with the DMFC seems more extended than that of a system without the DMFC."

Methods: Eighty-Six patients who underwent 1–2 levels of MIS-TLIF were randomly allocated to receive a TiPEEK or PEEK cage. Patient-reported outcomes were recorded using visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and EuroQoL-5D-5L. Postoperative radiographs and computed tomography were assessed for spinal fusion and cage subsidence. Results: The eligible 82 patients (41 patients, 49 operated levels in TiPEEK group and 41 patients, 50 operated levels in PEEK group) were included in the final analysis. Over total follow-up, the mean difference in visual analog scale back and leg pain scores between TiPEEK versus PEEK group was −0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.5 to 0.4; P = 0.85) and −0.12 (95% CI, −0.6 to 0.3; P = 0.62), respectively. The mean difference in Oswestry Disability Index scores was −0.71 (95% CI, −3.8 to 2.4; P = 0.65), and the mean difference in EQ-5D-5 L was 0.03 (95% CI, −0.01 to 0.06; P = 0.11) in TiPEEK group versus PEEK group as a reference. TiPEEK showed significantly higher fusion rates than PEEK at 6-month (91.8% vs. 76%; P = 0.03), but no difference at 12-month postoperation. There was no significant difference in cage subsidence rates between the 2 groups. Conclusions: The patient-reported outcomes showed significant improvements at 6- and 12-month postoperation following MIS-TLIF; the differences in those with TiPEEK versus PEEK cages were minimal with tight CIs. Fusion rates in both groups were ≥90%, with TiPEEK cages showing higher fusion rates at 6 months after the procedure."

Rubraxanthone exhibited mixed-inhibition antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, relatively low cytotoxicity, and high cellular inhibition. However, the atomic inhibition mechanism remains ambiguous. LB-PaCS-MD/FMO is a hybrid ligand-binding evaluation method elucidating how rubraxanthone interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In the first step, LB-PaCS-MD, which is regarded as a flexible docking, efficiently samples a set of ligand-binding pathways. After that, a reasonable docking pose of LB-PaCS-MD is evaluated by the FMO calculation to elucidate a set of protein–ligand interactions, enabling one to know the binding affinity of a specified ligand with respect to a target protein. A possible conformation was proposed for rubraxanthone binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, and allosteric inhibition was elucidated by combining blind docking with k-means clustering. The interaction profile, key binding residues, and considerable interaction were elucidated for rubraxanthone binding to both Mpro sites. Integrated LB-PaCS-MD/FMO provided a more reasonable complex structure for ligand binding at the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, which is vital for discovering and designing antiviral drugs."

When the indoor air quality level is below the standard but the people are unable to detect and continue to work in that area, it may affect to human health and cause respiratory disease. In this study, a carbon dioxide (CO2) sorbent based on the synthesis of potassium carbonate/gamma-alumina (K2CO3/γ-Al2O3) modified with amine-based solvents was developed. The sorbent exhaustion was indicated by observing the indicator color change for indoor direct air capture of CO2. The results showed that the modified sorbent had adsorption capacity around 60–64 mg CO2/g sorbent under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The modified sorbent could successfully demonstrate its exhaustion by changing color of the sorbent. In addition, the exhaustion sorbents could also be reused by thermal regeneration process using conventional microwave oven due to the low power consumption and less regeneration time."

Sampling was performed in Lashkar, Sadaf, and Sajjad, three urban green spaces in Mashhad, a city located in Razavi Khorasan province. A total of 29 insect species including 16 natural enemies and 13 herbivores were identified. The results indicated that herbivore abundance was positively and significantly correlated with the level of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, but not with the level of fine particulate matter. In contrast, herbivore diversity was negatively and significantly correlated only with the level of carbon monoxide. As for natural enemies, abundance and diversity both were not significantly correlated with the levels of none of all three pollutants. The aphid, Cinara thujafilina Del Guercio was the most dominant herbivore species in all the sampling sites with a relative abundance of 86% at Lashkar, 93% at Sadaf, and 95% at Sajjad. Regarding natural enemies, the ladybird, Coccinella septempunctata was the most abundant species both at Lashkar (49%) and Sadaf (35%) while the ladybird, Oenopia conglubata was the most abundant at Sajjad (21%). The highest diversity of herbivores and natural enemies across the four seasons were at the Lashkar and Sadaf sites.

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of treatment, but can be challenging due to the high bleeding risk in some cancers and the high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with malignancies. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are well established as first-choice treatments for VTE in non-cancer patients, offering a more convenient and less invasive treatment option than low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Asian patients have exhibited comparable efficacy and safety outcomes with other races in trials of DOACs for VTE in the general population. Although no specific data are available in Asian patients with CAT, results from randomized controlled trials of apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban versus the LMWH, dalteparin, indicate that DOACs are a reasonable alternative to LMWH for anticoagulation in Asian patients with CAT. This is further supported by analyses of real-world data in Asian populations demonstrating the efficacy and safety of DOACs in Asian patients with CAT. Apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban are recommended in the most recently updated international guidelines as first-line therapy for CAT in patients without gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers and at low risk of bleeding. An increased risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding was evident with edoxaban or rivaroxaban, but not apixaban, versus dalteparin in the clinical trials, suggesting that apixaban could be a safe alternative to LMWH in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Determining the optimal anticoagulant therapy for patients with CAT requires careful consideration of bleeding risk, tumor type, renal function, drug–drug interactions, financial costs, and patients’ needs and preferences."

The combinational use of these plants is a common practice in Southeast Asia. Synergism between curcumin and piperine has been found in several animal models but not in periodontal disease and diabetes, and the antinociceptive interaction is still unknown. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the interaction between curcumin and piperine in pain and its potential CNS side effect profile. Methods: Formalin test and in vitro LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were used to assess the synergistic interaction of curcumin and piperine in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Tail-flick and cold plate tests were applied to determine the antinociceptive synergism between piperine and curcumin. The interaction was determined by applying isobolographic analysis. The potential CNS-side effects of the curcumin and piperine combination were also assessed using LABORAS automated home-cage behavioral analysis. Results: Curcumin alone dose-dependently improved pain-like behaviors in the formalin, tail-flick, and cold plate tests with the ED50 of 71.4, 34.4, and 31.9 mg/kg, respectively. Additionally, piperine exhibited efficacy in the formalin, tail-flick, and cold plate tests with the ED50 of 18.4, 8.1, and 28.1 mg/kg, respectively. The combination of curcumin and piperine (1:1 ED50 ratio) produced synergistic interaction in the formalin, tail-flick, and cold plate tests as assessed significantly lower experimental ED50 values (5.9, 5.2, and 5.5 mg/kg) compared to theoretical ED50 values (44.9, 21.3, and 30.0 mg/kg), isobologram analysis, and interaction index values of 0.13, 0.24 and 0.18, respectively. The synergistic interaction of curcumin and piperine was further confirmed by the efficacy of the combination in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Curcumin and piperine interacted synergistically, reducing proinflammatory mediators. The combination also demonstrated better compatibility profiles with neuronal cells. Furthermore, the curcumin-piperine combination had no effects on mouse spontaneous locomotor behaviors in LABORAS automated home cage monitoring. Conclusion: Overall, the present study demonstrates strong antinociceptive synergism between curcumin and piperine in mouse models with no potential CNS side effects, suggesting its possible use in clinical trials."
['Multidisciplinary'],"A data driven approach in less expensive robust transmitting coverage and power optimization  2022, The Author(s).This paper aims the development of a new reduced-cost algorithm for a multi-objective robust transmitter placement under uncertainty.

We consider minimization of the energy power consumption for transmitting as well as maximization of signal coverage in a multi-objective robust optimization model. The reliability of the model to control signal overlap for multiple transmitting antennas is also provided. To smooth computational cost, the proposed method instead of evaluating all receiver test points in each optimization iteration approximates signal coverages using Kriging interpolation to obtain optimal transmitter positions. The results demonstrate the utility and the efficiency of the proposed method in rendering the robust optimal design and analyzing the sensitivity of the transmitter placement problem under practically less-expensive computational efforts (350% and 320% less than computational time elapsed using standalone GWO and NSGAII respectively)."

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been considered the standard radiation technique. However, patients suffer from treatment-related toxicities, and most die from disease progression or recurrence. With emerging technological advancement, proton therapy has theoretical advantages over IMRT because it offers apparent dosimetric benefits to allow dose escalation to the target while better sparing surrounding tissues such as the lungs, heart, liver, and spinal cord. The purpose of this study protocol is to investigate the survival benefit of proton therapy using modern intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) compared to standard IMRT for esophageal cancer. Methods: This is a two-arm open phase II/III multi-institution randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients will have histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus with no evidence of tracheoesophageal/esophagobronchial fistula or distant metastasis. After stratification according to resectability status (resectable vs. borderline resectable/unresectable), a total of 232 patients will be randomized to receive IMPT or IMRT using a 1:1 allocation ratio. In resectable cases, surgical resection following concurrent chemoradiation will be attempted for the patients who are medically fit at the time of surgery. In those with initially borderline resectable/unresectable disease, definitive concurrent chemoradiation will be performed. The phase II study will assess safety (toxicity and postoperative complications) and feasibility (recruitment rate and chemoradiation dose modification) in 40 patients into each arm. The study will then continue into phase III, further recruit 76 patients into each arm, and compare progression-free survival between IMPT vs IMRT groups. The secondary endpoints will be overall survival, local and distant control, toxicities, health-related quality of life, and cost-utility. This protocol describes a detailed radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Discussion: This randomized clinical trial will demonstrate the clinical benefit of IMPT in esophageal cancer treatment in terms of survival and toxicity outcomes which will further establish high-level evidence for radiation modality in squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus.

H2/CO2 ratio in the feed gas composition was varied at the stoichiometry of the Sabatier reaction assuming a fictitious CO2 conversion of 0 to 0.7. Non-stochiometric gas feeding and the addition of product gases, i.e., methane and steam, were also considered to examine reaction orders and inhibition effects. The kinetic tests were carried out at 300–350 °C and 0.1–0.9 MPa. GHSV corresponded to 37,494 h−1. The stable activity was achieved by forcibly stressing the catalyst under the equilibria at 500 °C for 35 h. The kinetic measurements were conducted at an isothermal differential fixed bed reactor in the absence of heat and mass transport limitations. The methanation reaction was first fitted with the power law and LH approaches by considering the Sabatier reaction. Then, the RWGS reaction was added to consider CO formation using the power law models. The results showed a better fitting of experimental observations by using the LH expression with the formation of formyl as RDS and the power law model with inhibiting influence of water."

The introduction of an electron-withdrawing substituent on the phenyl ring creates a push-pull system that shows solvent-dependent intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and solvatochromic properties. Among these, the styryl pyrene probes with nitro (Py-NO2) and aldehyde (Py-CHO) substituents exhibited remarkable sensitivity to environment polarity. They show remarkable fluorescence changes from green to red, and blue to orange in nonpolar to polar organic solvents, respectively. The results were explained by the Lippert-Mataga and ET(30) models, which were supported by theoretical calculations by the density functional theory (DFT). Importantly, the fluorescence emission of Py-NO2 in organic solvents is sensitive to the presence of water in the range of 0–34.2% (v/v) in THF, 0–9.1% (v/v) in DMF, and 0–39.7% (v/v) in CH3CN.

Py-CHO showed somewhat higher limits of detection than Py-NO2 for the same solvents but exhibited a broad linear response to water content in EtOH between 3.3 and 63.6% (v/v) water content with the limit of detection at 2.350% (v/v). Thus, it is possibly useful as a sensor for the wide range detection of alcohol content in beverages. These push-pull styryl pyrene probes not only served as a new supersensitive fluorescent sensor for the quantitative detection of low to medium-level water content in organic solvents but may also be useful in a broad range of applications."
['Energy (all)'],"Specific heat capacity prediction of hybrid nanofluid using artificial neural network and its heat transfer application  2022 The Author(s)Currently, many industries aim to improve the heat transfer system to reduce cost and carbon emission. For improving heat exchanger apparatus, the convectional working fluid such as water can be replaced by hybrid nanofluid. The hybrid nanofluid is a suspension of nanoparticles into conventional base fluids to improve its properties. Generally, different combinations of nanoparticle and base fluid can variably enhance the specific heat capacity for removing heat from the system. In this study, the artificial neural network was thus employed to develop the prediction model for predicting specific heat capacity using feedforward and cascade forward propagation networks with Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm. The best artificial neural network (ANN) model topology was selected to predict specific heat capacity of hybrid nanofluid with R value of 0.9919, 0.9473 and 0.9673 for training, validating and testing, respectively. Then, the specific heat capacity value from ANN model was applied to evaluate and analyze the heat transfer rates. The hybrid nanofluid with Al2O3 and CuO in water exhibited the best heat removing medium in heat exchanger application."

Existing methods to strengthen substandard lap splices primarily involve wrapping the substandard lap spliced regions with jackets possessing mainly in-plane stiffness. Hence, the efficiency of such techniques is compromised due to the lateral bulging of concrete and flexural bending of jackets. This study investigated hollow steel section (HSS) collars which offer axial and flexural stiffness in mitigating splitting failures associated with lap splices not conforming to current design codes. Three lap splice lengths, mainly 20, 28, and 35 times the bar diameter (db) were studied. Experiments were conducted on 19 beams subjected to four-point bending, with substandard lap splices within the constant moment region. Test variables involved the lap splice length, concrete cover, and spacing of HSS collars. Results revealed that HSS collars successfully prevented splitting failures resulting in ductile behavior. It was found that the bond stress of the lap-spliced bars increased till the onset of their yielding. Beyond that, the bond stress was maintained close to their peak value in the beams sufficiently confined by HSS collars. By applying HSS collars, improvements in the bond strength for beams with 20db lap splices were evident. The control beams having longer lap splice lengths exhibited yielding, and the improvement in their bond strength was limited despite showing ductile behavior. In order to capture the contribution of HSS collars to the improvement from brittle behavior to ductile behavior, the interfacial fracture energy was also used instead of the bond strength alone. An equation for the increase in the interfacial fracture energy due to the confinement by HSS collars was obtained using nonlinear regression. This equation was utilized to determine the required confinement ratio of HSS collars for a given substandard lap splice. The required confinement ratios of HSS collars obtained from the proposed equation were found to agree with the experiment while overestimation was found in some cases."

The results demonstrate that morphology has a significant and different effect on toluene adsorption under dry or wet conditions. The dynamic adsorption capacities follow S–S (spherical-like silicalite-1) > P–S (plate-like silicalite-1) > B–S (brick-like silicalite-1) under the dry condition (303 K). For the wet condition (RH = 50%, 303 K), the order of the dynamic adsorption capacities is P–S > S–S > B–S. Silicalite-1 zeolites were tested for five adsorption-regeneration cycles to study the reusability and their performance remained stable above 85% after five cycles. The calculated rate constants of Yoon-Nelson model and Weber-Morris (W-M) intra-particle diffusion model reveal that there is less diffusion resistance in P–S. The findings may provide valuable information on zeolite-based adsorbents for adsorption removal or recovery of volatile organic compounds."

Cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1 has been approved to treat numerous cancers and is the backbone of cancer immunotherapy. Anti-PD-1 molecule is necessary for next-generation cancer immunotherapy to further improve clinical efficacy and safety as well as integrate into novel treatment combinations or platforms. We developed a highly efficient hybridoma generation and screening strategy to generate high-potency chimeric anti-PD-1 molecules. Using this strategy, we successfully generated several mouse hybridoma and mouse/human chimeric clones that produced high-affinity antibodies against human PD-1 with high-quality in vitro PD-1/PD-L1 binding blockade and T cell activation activities. The lead chimeric prototypes exhibited overall in vitro performance comparable to commercially available anti-PD-1 antibodies and could be qualified as promising therapeutic candidates for further development toward immuno-oncology applications."
"['Materials Science (all)', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Materials Chemistry']","Identification of B33 and Cm martensitic products in CuZr-based alloys: A DFT study  2022B33 and Cm phases as martensite products of CuZr-based alloys are still controversial and even confused. This work identified that the B33 and Cm are martensite products of binary CuZr and ternary CuZrX systems, respectively, and revealed the martensite transformation (MT) barriers and pathways of the two systems by the DFT method. According to our results, in binary CuZr alloy, B19' phase is firstly formed along the B2→RB19'→B19' path with the barrier of 0.28 eV. Then B33 phase formation follows the no-barrier pathway of B19'→B33. However, due to the higher MT barrier and the fact that the Cm lattice observed in B19' supercell is still B19' phase, the Cm phase was excluded from CuZr martensite products. As for CuZrX systems, the symmetry reduction caused by the third metallic element X makes the Cm phase appear in all Cu43.75Zr50X6.25 and Cu37.5Zr50X12.5 alloys. Owing to the lattice overlap, the Cm phase in the CuZrX system is always accompanied by B19'. Notably, the transformations of all Cu43.75Zr50X6.25 and most Cu37.5Zr50X12.5 martensites prefer the two-step pathway of B2→RM→M rather than the B2→M path. Especially for Cu37.5Zr50Ni12.5 martensite, there is no transformation barrier along the B2→RM→M path."

Here, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) were used to fabricate polyelectrolyte complex membranes which were further modified by the in situ synthesis of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). Polyelectrolyte complexes prepared from different polycation : polyanion molar ratios (2 : 1, 1 : 1, and 1 : 2) were sequentially dipped in a solution of zinc acetate and then in a 2‑methylimidazole solution to induce the formation of ZIF-8 crystals. Scanning electron microscopy results revealed that the ZIF-8 crystals could be synthesized only in the 1 : 2 ratio polyelectrolyte complex which presents an excess of polyanion and that the synthesis was restricted to the polyelectrolyte complex’s surface. Interestingly, using a “salt doping” approach with increasing sodium chloride concentrations from 0 to 1.5 M, zinc ion diffusion could be enhanced, leading to an improved ZIF-8 crystal formation in the polyelectrolyte complex membranes. These results are of interest for the development of functional membranes with asymmetric particle distribution, found for example in pervaporation membranes or in alkaline fuel cell separation membranes."

Therefore, healthcare systems utilize the convergence power and traffic analysis of sensors that cannot be satisfactorily handled by the IoT. In this article, a novel mutation operator is devised and incorporated with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Two tests have been conducted in the validation process. Firstly, the newly dual adaption-based operators incorporated with the differential evolution algorithm are being proposed. The proposed approach provides sufficient diversity and enhances the search speed of nature's local and global search environments in the problem. The proposed method incorporates the application of IoT-based smart healthcare. Second, an application-based test has been conducted, in which the proposed approach is applied to the application in the smart healthcare system. Therefore, IoT sensor deployment is an optimization problem to minimize service time, delay, and energy loss by considering the communication constraint between sensors(objects). The proposed algorithm is applied in this article to solve this optimization problem. Further, in the experimentation and comparative study, the proposed method is superior to the standard evolutionary algorithms in IoT applications concerning the minimum number of function evaluations and minimization of traffic services. The proposed approach also achieves efficiency in the minimum loss of energy in each service and reduces load and delay."
['Multidisciplinary'],"A performance comparison between fluorescent immunoassay and immunochromatography for rapid dengue detection in clinical specimens  2022, The Author(s).Dengue virus (DENV 1–4) infection has been a global health threat where no specific treatment is currently available. Therefore, a rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for an appropriate management as it could reduce the burden of severe clinical manifestation. Currently, dengue immunochromatography (IC) is commonly used to primarily differentiate acute febrile illnesses. Fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) utilized a highly sensitive detection system and claimed 70–100% sensitivity and 83.5–91.7% specificity for dengue infection in a preliminary report. This report recruited samples with acute febrile illnesses sent for dengue screening and tested IC and FIA in parallel. The performance of both tests was verified by a definitive diagnosis retrieved from combinatorial reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM and IgG confirmation tests. Results showed that the viral nonstructural protein (NS1) performance of FIA was slightly higher than IC with the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, agreement, kappa, and its standard error at 79.11, 92.28, 86.81, 87.31, 352 (87.13%), 0.725 ± 0.035, respectively; whereas those of the IC were at 76.58, 92.28, 86.43, 85.98, 348 (86.14%), 0.703 ± 0.037, respectively. Moreover, the IgM and IgG performance of FIA had higher specificity, PPV, and agreement than the IgM IC performance, suggesting that the FIA was more specific but less sensitive for antibody detection. No correlation was observed in IgM and IgG levels of ELISA and FIA assays. In conclusion, the FIA and IC were highly sensitive, specific, and substantially agreed in NS1 detection but moderately agreed in IgM and IgG detection."
['Nursing (all)'],"Nurse-based educational interventions in patients with peritoneal dialysis: A systematic review and meta-analysis  2022 The Author(s)Background: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a major renal replacement therapy modality for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. As poor self-care of PD patients could lead to serious complications, including peritonitis, exit-site infection, technique failure, and death; several nurse-based educational interventions have been introduced. However, these interventions varied and have been supported by small-scale studies so the effectiveness of nurse-based educational interventions on clinical outcomes of PD patients has been inconclusive. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of nurse-based education interventions in PD patients. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). Methods: We performed a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL up to December 31, 2021. Selection criteria included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) relevant to nurse-based education interventions in ESKD patients with PD in the English language. The meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model to evaluate the summary outcomes of peritonitis, PD-related infection, mortality, transfer to hemodialysis, and quality of life (QoL). Results: From 9,816 potential studies, 71 theme-related abstracts were selected for further full-text articles screening against eligibility criteria. As a result, eleven studies (1,506 PD patients in seven countries) were included in our systematic review. Of eleven studies, eight studies (1,363 PD patients in five countries) were included in the meta-analysis. Sleep QoL in the intervention group was statistically significantly higher than control (mean difference = 12.76, 95% confidence intervals 5.26–20.27). There was no difference between intervention and control groups on peritonitis, PD-related infection, HD transfer, and overall QoL. Conclusions: Nurse-based educational interventions could help reduce some PD complications, of which only the sleep QoL showed statistically significant improvement. High-quality evidence on the nurse-based educational interventions was limited and more RCTs are needed to provide more robust outcomes. Tweetable abstract: Nurse-based educational interventions showed promising sleep quality improvement and potential peritonitis risk reduction among PD patients."

All rights reserved.The local optima problem is one of the biggest obstacles in compact genetic algorithms since each bit in the problem encoding string is inde-pendent of the others. We propose a quantum-assisted compact genetic algorithm that uses a quantum amplitude amplification technique in the selection process to circumvent the said problem. In addition to using elitism mechanics where a single best candidate solution is kept to drive the probability vector, the amplitude amplification subroutine also acts as a mutation operator which, with high probability, enforces the constraint that the newly generated candidate is a feasible solution. We demonstrate this idea by applying the algorithm to the traveling salesman problem of size 3 and 4 cities on IBM Qiskit simulator to show how one would con-struct the quantum circuit and how to encode the optimization problem into quantum states via Ising spin model encoding. We then show space and time complexity analysis based on the quantum circuit model. Finally, we discuss the number of qubits required for encoding, gate counts in the circuit model, and the practicality of applying this to a small-scale devices in the future."

Due to the high human-animal interface, the monitoring of canine influenza in dogs and the study of the transmission and pathogenicity of canine influenza in animals are important. Methods: Eight-week-old beagle dogs (Canis lupus familaris) (n = 13) were used for the intraspecies transmission model. The dogs were inoculated intranasally with 1 ml of 106 EID50 per ml of canine H3N2 influenza virus (A/canine/Thailand/CU-DC5299/2012) (CIV-H3N2). In addition, 4-week-old guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) (n = 20) were used for the interspecies transmission model. The guinea pigs were inoculated intranasally with 300 µl of 106 EID50 per ml of CIV-H3N2. Results: For the Thai CIV-H3N2 challenged in the dog model, the incoculated and direct contact dogs developed respiratory signs at 2 dpi. The dogs shed the virus in the respiratory tract at 1 dpi and developed an H3-specific antibody against the virus at 10 dpi. Lung congestion and histopathological changes in the lung were observed. For the Thai CIV-H3N2 challenge in the guinea pig model, the incoculated, direct contact and aerosol-exposed guinea pigs developed fever at 1–2 dpi. The guinea pigs shed virus in the respiratory tract at 2 dpi and developed an H3-specific antibody against the virus at 7 dpi. Mild histopathological changes in the lung were observed. Conclusion: The result of this study demonstrated evidence of intraspecies and interspecies transmission of CIV-H3N2 in a mammalian model."

PCBs consist of organic epoxy resins overlaid with valuable metals. The first step in recovering metals from waste PCBs is the removal of these resins. In this paper, autoclave-assisted alkaline pretreatment employing NaOH was used to remove resins from the PCBs. The process is shown to remove epoxy efficiently when conducted at 350 °C for 18 h using 0.8 mol·L−1 NaOH, 18 bar, and a liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio of 18 mL·g−1. After autoclaving, the solid-phase sample (autoclaved powder) was treated with a mixture of FeCl3 and HCl solutions – a process known as “FeH extraction” – to remove industrial metals. Under the optimal conditions (0.8 mol·L−1 FeCl3, 0.6 mol·L−1 HCl, L/S 24 mL·g−1, 50 °C, 100 min, 300 rpm), this process proved highly efficient in removing industrial metals. Following this treatment, a KClO3-HCl-CaCl2 extraction system was employed to extract gold from the FeH-extracted sample. With this system, a 99.5% gold extraction efficiency was achieved under the optimal conditions (0.55 mol·L−1 KClO3, 1.2 mol·L−1 HCl, 1.5 mol·L−1 CaCl2, 60 °C, 80 min, L/S 12 mL·g−1, 350 rpm). Gold ions (AuCl4−) in the extracted solution were subsequently recovered by using hydroquinone as a reducing agent to form gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with the assistance of NaOH. Finally, the AuNPs were stabilized using benzoquinone (an oxidized product of hydroquinone)."
"['Pathology and Forensic Medicine', 'Genetics']","Comparisons of protocols for enhanced DNA profile quality from FTA®-deposited urine samples  2022 Elsevier B.V.Disputes over the identity of a urine sample donor have been reported, and urine authentication by genetic profiling has helped resolved the cases. However, since genotyping of urine is not always required, many drug-testing laboratories may face sample storage issues. Several studies have investigated the use of FTA® cards as a convenient tool for keeping specimen at room temperature for extended periods of time. However, generating complete STR profile from some FTA®-deposited urine samples remains challenging due to low levels of genetic material content, necessitating amendments to the laboratory's standard protocols. This work therefore aims to evaluate the effects of two DNA template preparation methods, both employing FTA® cards as the storage medium, on the success rates of STR profiling from urine. Specimen from a female volunteer, representing a particularly low-yield sample, was employed. Aliquots of 1 and 2 mL were used as the starting material to evaluate DNA template preparation using the FTA® manufacturer's protocol for disc purification against elution of DNA from the FTA® using Prepfiler™ Forensic DNA Extraction Kit. AmpFℓSTR™ Identifiler™ Plus PCR Amplification Kit was used to amplify the STR markers, and the PCR products were analysed using Applied Biosystems™ 3500xL Genetic Analyzer. The DNA profile qualities were examined in terms of number of loci detected and peak height balance. Comparisons with the profiles obtained from DNA isolated using QIAamp® DNA Micro Kit from 1 and 2 mL of the same batch of urine were also made. The optimised protocol was then tested on urine samples from three male volunteers. The results showed that the purification of FTA® punches according to the manufacturer's protocol enabled full DNA profiles to be obtained from both 1 and 2 mL of urine from all samples tested, including male samples. In contrast, no DNA profile could be generated from the DNA eluted with the Prepfiler™ kit. When compared with the more conventional solid-phase DNA extraction method, the profiles generated from the FTA® punches exhibited similar reproducibility and quality to those from the template isolated by the QIAamp® Kit. This work further demonstrated the feasibility of FTA® cards as a tool for specimen storage and DNA template preparation from small volumes of urine for authentication by STR profiling. Full STR profiles could be generated from sample from both sexes without modification of the PCR conditions or injection time."

Five beams, in which one is the control beam, and the other four beams are enlarged with ferrocement jacket, are prepared for the four-point bending tests. The obtained results indicate that the retrofit of the RC beams with ferrocement jacket alone induces the adverse influence on the member performance in terms of the load-carrying capacity, stiffness, safety, and ductility. In contrast, the strengthening with the ferrocement jacket incorporating addition of the steel tension bars noticeably improves the flexural efficiency of the RC beams. In such circumstance, besides the amelioration in the capacity, stiffness, and ductility, the strengthened beams exhibit numerous flexural cracks with narrow spacing and small width following the yielding of longitudinal reinforcement and the crushing of concrete at loading area. In addition, the continuity for the stress transfer at the ferrocement–concrete bonded interface remarkably governs the failure mechanism and ductility of the retrofitted beams. The discontinuity of the adherence between ferrocement and concrete by shear connector with anchored bars coupling the addition of the tensile reinforcement positively impacts the performance of the ferrocement-retrofitted beams. Sectional analysis cannot predict the flexural strength of the beams retrofitted with only ferrocement, while it can accurately assess the maximum capacity of the control beam and the beams with both ferrocement jacket and additional steels."

This study aimed to examine the parental COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy (PVh) level and influencing factors among Thai parents of children 5–18 years of age. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Thailand during May and June of 2022. The Google forms for data collection were distributed to parents (a father, a mother, or one who nurtures and raises a child) via various online social media. Data regarding PVh level, relevant attitudes, experiences of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination (EC&V), and family contexts (FC) were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the differences among groups of parents based on EC&V and FC. The factors influencing PVh were assessed by multiple regression analysis. Results: Four hundred and eighty-eight parents completed the online questionnaire. Their median (IQR) age was 41 (35–47) years. They lived in different provinces from all regions across Thailand. Ninety percent of them were authorized persons to make decision about children vaccination. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents had vaccine hesitancy, defined as PVh level at moderate or above. Parents who had ever refused COVID-19 vaccination for themselves or refused to vaccinate their children against any other diseases had statistically significant higher levels of PVh (p value < 0.001). Conversely, the parents who had finished the initial COVID-19 vaccine had lower PVh levels with statistical significance (p value = 0.001). Attitude towards COVID-19 (AC), attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine (AV), and perceived behavioral control (PC) of the parents negatively influenced PVh with statistical significance, according to the results of the multiple regression analysis (Betas = − 0.307, − 0.123, and − 0.232, respectively). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was commonly found among Thai parents. The factors of the hesitancy were multifaceted. Different experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination for themselves and any vaccinations for their children were associated with different PVhs. The attitudes especially AC, AV, and PC statistically influenced PVh. These findings should be exploited for national and local policy planning as well as public campaigns."

Materials and methods: hDPs were immortalized using SV40 T-antigen transfection. Characterization, multilineage differentiation, proliferation, cell cycle, colony-forming unit, and cellular senescence were evaluated (n = 4). The effect of BET on ihDP response was assessed (n = 4). Osteogenic differentiation was detected using ALP, ARS staining, and RT-qPCR (n = 4). To investigate the involvement of calcium signaling, the cells were pretreated with either 8-(NN-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8) or thapsigargin before BET treatment (n = 6). Results: ihDPs retained similar phenotypic characteristics presented in hDPs but exhibited an increase in cell proliferation and extended culture to passage 25. An increased proportion of cells in S and G2/M phases without senescence was observed in ihDPs. BET (50 mM) treatment significantly increased mineral deposition at 14 days and upregulated ALP, MSX2, BMP2, and RUNX2 expression. TMB-8 pretreatment reduced the effect of BET-induced ihDP osteogenic differentiation, whereas thapsigargin promoted osteogenic differentiation in ihDPs synergistically with BET. Conclusion: ihDPs showed superior proliferation ability and a longer life span, which could serve as a promising cell for regenerative dentistry. BET promoted odonto/osteogenic differentiation via intracellular calcium regulation."
