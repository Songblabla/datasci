"['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","Flexible Printed Active Antenna for Digital Television Reception  2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE).This paper presents the development of a flexible printed active antenna for the digital television (DTV) reception in areas having poor signal or in high-rise buildings. The antenna structure is composed of a meander line printed on a polyimide film as a radiating element. It has a thickness of 0.3 mm, highly flexible, and very lightweight. The design and analysis of the radiating element are based on a full-wave method implemented by a commercial electromagnetic simulation software. The amplifier circuit consisting of a surface-mount transistor and passive components are integrated directly on the polyimide film, residing next to the feedline, to improve the antenna performance and minimize the whole antenna dimension. The impedance matching between the radiating element, the feed line, and the active circuit are considered. The measured results show that the return loss of more than approximately 10 dB, the maximum gain of about 18 dB, and the Omni-directional radiation pattern are achieved in the operating frequency band of 510-790 MHz. Due to its flexibility, low profile, lightweight, and additional gain, the proposed antenna could be useful for various specific applications."

The solid mixtures consisted of Ni-based catalyst and CaO sorbent. The aim of study was to design a proper pilot-scale CFB riser which produced hydrogen (H2) with both high purity and high flux. The design parameters and the reaction parameters were examined with 2k full factorial design. The significances of each parameter were analyzed by analysis of variance. Using the optimum result, the highest H2 purity reached 98.58% in dry basis accompanied with the highest H2 flux of 0.301 kg/m2 s. The hydrodynamics of this optimum case showed that SESMR was nearly completed since 5.0 m height because axial and radial distributions of solid were well developed without excessive segregation between catalyst and sorbent. Thus, the H2 purity and the H2 flux approached fully developed within the riser height."

A superhydrophobic/superoleophilic mesh was successfully prepared in a simple and environmentally friendly process by coating with fluoroalkylsilane-modified natural rubber-encapsulated silica latex (FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 ). TEM images confirmed the formation of a core-shell morphology, in which the rubber core was fully covered by a silica shell. This improved the thermal stability of the composites. Coating with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 enhanced both the hydrophobicity and surface roughness of the mesh. The depth profile of the XPS spectra revealed the presence of fluoroalkylsilane on the superhydrophobic mesh and Ar gas ion etching confirmed migration of the fluoroalkylsilane, SiO 2 and carbon to the mesh surface. SEM and AFM results quantified the surface roughness of the coated mesh. Meshes coated with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 exhibited superhydrophobic/superoleophilic properties. Surfaces coated with these encapsulated particles were successfully applied to oil/water separation. They exhibited a separation efficiency of up to 100% and were reusable across 30 cycles."

A label-free electrochemical DNA sensor based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-immobilized on a paper-based analytical device (PAD) was developed. Unlike previous PNA-based electrochemical PAD (ePAD) sensors where the capture element was placed directly on the electrode, acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper allowing regeneration by simple PAD replacement. As an example application, a sensor probe was designed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) detection. The ePAD DNA sensor was used to determine a synthetic 15-base oligonucleotide of MTB by measuring the fractional change in the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The R ct of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3-/4- before and after hybridization with the target DNA could be clearly distinguished. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to verify the EIS results, and showed an increase in peak potential splitting in a similar stepwise manner for each immobilization step. Under optimal conditions, a linear calibration curve in the range of 2–200 nM and the limit of detection 1.24 nM were measured. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch and non-complementary DNA targets due to the conformationally constrained structure of the acpcPNA. Moreover, the ePAD DNA sensor platform was successfully applied to detect PCR-amplified MTB DNA extracted from clinical samples. The proposed paper-based electrochemical DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative device for low-cost, simple, label-free, sensitive and selective DNA sensor."

The methodologies used in this paper are two folded. The first methodology is to develop a simulation model that allows manager to evaluate the impact of having different number of trailers on delivery and cost in order to identify the optimal fleet size. The second methodology is to use a Design of experiment (DOE) together with the simulation model to identify important factors that affect transportation performances. The result shows that the company should hire 16 trailers, which will reduce the delivery delay from 14% to 0.02%. Furthermore, it is found that variation in demand has a strong impact on late delivery and cost. There is also an interaction between demand variation and transportation time variation."
['Genetics'],"The phenotypic and mutational spectrum of Thai female patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency  2018 Elsevier B.V.Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked urea cycle disorder affecting both males and females. Hemizygous males commonly present with severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy during the neonatal period. Heterozygous females have great phenotypic variability. The majority of female patients can manifest later in life or have unrecognized symptoms, making the diagnosis of OTCD in females very challenging. Here we report on three unrelated Thai female cases with OTCD presenting with different manifestations including aggressive behavior, acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy. Whole exome sequencing successfully identified disease-causing mutations in all three cases including two novel ones: the c.209_210delAA (p.Lys70Argfs*17) and the c.850T>A (p.Tyr284Asn). This study affirms variable symptoms in female patients with OTCD and emphasizes the importance of early recognition and prompt management for favorable outcomes. In addition, identification of two novel causative variants expands the genotypic spectrum of OTC."

Prior attempts used traditional prediction techniques based on Bag of words (BoW), where the order of words is discarded, resulting in low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a prediction model of criminal cases from Thai Supreme Court using End-To-End Deep Learning Neural Networks. Our model imitates a process of legal interpretation, whereby recurrent neural networks read the fact from an input case and compare them against relevant legal provisions with the attention mechanism. The model's output shows if a person is guilty of a crime according to the fact and laws. After the performance test, we find that our model could yield the higher F1 than traditional text classification techniques including Naive Bayes and SVM. In addition, we innovate the open dataset called 'Thai Supreme Court Cases (TSCC)' that was compiled from many decades of Thai Supreme Court criminal judgements. It features the text of fact expertly extracted from each judgement, textual provisions from Thai Criminal Code, and binary-format labels following the theoretical criminal law structure. This dataset is useful for achieving judgement predicting task together with emulating actual criminal case trial."

The fabrication of polysaccharides to be nanoparticles or nanocapsules is quite specific due to various parameters and factors. The present work demonstrates a simple pathway to selectively prepare the ionic polysaccharide flakes to be nanoparticles or nanocapsules. The systematic studies on the model cases of cationic polysaccharide (i.e., chitosan) and anionic polysaccharide (i.e., alginate) confirm that pK a is the key point to tune the polysaccharides to be nanoparticles or nanocapsules. When the ionic polysaccharides were in an oil/water emulsion system, the pH close to pK a leads to the densely packed polysaccharide chains under the hydrogen bond networks, and as a result the cross-link occurs all through the chains to be nanoparticles. On the other hand, when pH was adjusted to the lower or higher than pK a depending on the types of ionic polysaccharide, the polysaccharide chains are under charge-charge repulsive force, resulting in the alignment of polysaccharide chains to be hollow nanospheres, and at that time the cross-link initiates the formation of nanocapsules. The present work, for the first time, clarifies that pH variation is the key to selectively prepare nanoparticles or nanocapsules, and this is important for delivery systems, coatings, sensors, and so forth."

This is due to the fact that each physician's diagnosis is different depending on the physician's knowledge, skill, and experience. In several cases, physicians may ignore uncommon diseases. Also, after the diagnosis, the physician has to provide ICD-10-CM code. This is a difficult process for most (if not all) physicians. We propose a predictive model for classifying disease from symptoms by applying text mining technique. Our research technique allows physician to diagnose and to access an ICD-10-CM code directly from symptoms. Our models are based on several classifiers such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. Models from each classifier were compared using training time, predicting time, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), precision and accuracy. The result suggests that Neural Network gives the best TPR at 89.03%."

Dentsu's AISAS model is a model that has been proposed to describe consumer behavior. The model defines reaction when the consumer has seen advertising into five stages: attention, interest, search, action, and share. In this paper, advertisement text datasets from Facebook were labelled as the stages of AISAS model and learned to be classified by machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, like many other real-world data, our dataset had imbalanced class distribution. The classifier algorithms tend to predict mostly the majority class. To overcome this problem, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was adopted and also combined with chi-square based feature selection technique. Varieties of feature sizes based on various classifier algorithms were compared. In the appropriate feature size, SMOTE could improve the classification performance in terms of recall and F1 score."

All rights reserved.A new class of quiescent galaxies harboring possible AGN-driven winds has been discovered using spatially resolved optical spectroscopy from the ongoing SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. These galaxies, termed ""red geysers,"" constitute 5%-10% of the local quiescent population and are characterized by narrow bisymmetric patterns in ionized gas emission features. Cheung et al. argued that these galaxies host large-scale AGN-driven winds that may play a role in suppressing star formation at late times. In this work, we test the hypothesis that AGN activity is ultimately responsible for the red geyser phenomenon. We compare the nuclear radio activity of the red geysers to a matched control sample with similar stellar mass, redshift, rest-frame NUV - r color, axis ratio, and presence of ionized gas. We have used the 1.4 GHz radio continuum data from the VLA FIRST survey to stack the radio flux from the red geyser and control samples. In addition to a three times higher FIRST detection rate, we find that red geysers have a 5σ higher level of average radio flux than control galaxies. After restricting to rest-frame NUV - r color >5 and checking mid-IR WISE photometry, we rule out star formation contamination and conclude that red geysers are associated with more active AGNs. Red geysers and a possibly related class with disturbed Hα emission account for 40% of all radio-detected red galaxies with log (M ∗/M o) < 11. Our results support a picture in which episodic AGN activity drives large-scale, relatively weak ionized winds that may provide a feedback mechanism for many early-type galaxies"

Adverse impacts have been natural resources depletion, environmental pollution, deforestation, food contamination and public health concerns. Thai higher education institutions (HEIs) have contributed to problems, promoting agrochemical-dependent farming with limited attention to organic agriculture (OA). Our paper examines how Thai HEIs incorporate OA into curricula and extension services, and how students perceive the value and adequacy of OA courses and training. It reviews policy and syllabus documents among 49 HEIs. Our analysis suggests most universities still do not view OA as a priority. Second, we examine student and graduate perceptions to illustrate national challenges. A survey of senior undergraduate students and recent alumni in one HEI showed both groups believed they did not have sufficient lectures or courses in OA or adequate resources and training to pursue an OA-related career after graduation. Current students viewed inadequacies even greater. Our conclusions suggest Thai HEIs must do more to reform programs, improve OA curricula and better support graduates. More research is needed to gather detailed and refined information from university agriculture education program administrators and documents with more qualitative and quantitative data on students from other Thai Universities."

Above the MIT, we unexpectedly find the long-range order of V - V dimer strength and crystal symmetry become dissociated beyond ≈200 nm, whereas the conductivity transition proceeds homogeneously in a narrow temperature range."

In addition, the effect of reaction volume of each reactor type was also investigated. For the smallest reaction volume of 165 mL, homogenizer and 20 kHz ultrasonic reactors offered the highest fatty acid methyl ester yield for both sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide catalysts. When the reaction volume was increased from 165 to 500 and 1000 mL with constant power input (80 W), homogenizer reactor did not significantly alter the rate of fatty acid methyl ester formation, unlike the other reactors which showed the decrease in the reaction rate. The reactor performance was evaluated in term of yield efficiency which was based on the amount of fatty acid methyl ester production, power consumption and reaction time. The increase of the reaction volume increased the yield efficiency of both the cavitation reactors and the mechanical stirred reactor. The highest yield efficiencies of 169.46 × 10−4 and 8.27 × 10−4 g/J were obtained from homogenizer reactor using sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide catalysts, respectively, using the reaction volume of 1000 mL.

CuIn 1-x Ga x Se 2 (112-CIGS) has been proposed as a material for high efficiency thin film solar cells with reliably applicable photovoltaic properties. Higher efficiency devices can be achieved by various surface treatments and are believed to have Cu deficiency at the surface. One of the possible techniques is to have a very thin Cu-depleted surface, e.g. Cu(In 1-x Ga x ) 3 Se 5 (135-CIGS) layer on top of 112-CIGS layer, thus the heterostructure of 135-CIGS/112-CIGS is formed. Our previous work show that the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of 135-CIGS with various thicknesses on 112-CIGS (135-CIGS/112-CIGS) heterostructure are identified as donor-to-acceptor pairs (DAPs) and free (conduction band) -to-bound (acceptor) transitions and show the temperature and excitation power dependence on the PL spectra. On the contrary, when the thin 112-CIGS layer is deposited on top of 135-CIGS (112-CIGS/135-CIGS), the PL spectra show more pronounced and resolved peaks which are surprisingly independent of temperature and excitation power and significantly distinguishable in its natures observed in those broad emissions of 135-CIGS/112-CIGS heterostructures. When the thickness of 112-CIGS on 135-CIGS is increased, the red shift in the order of ten meV is noticed in the emission lines from both 112-CIGS and 135-CIGS layers. These results suggest that the strains play more important roles in thinner capping layer and freeze out the temperature and excitation power dependence in the 112-CIGS/135-CIGS rather than the 135-CIGS/112-CIGS heterostructures."

CsI:Tl was crystalized by a modified homemade Bridgman-Stockbarger technique using different precursor purities. The purpose is to verify effects of precursor purity on optical properties of Cs:Tl crystals by UV-VIS and X-ray luminescence spectroscopy. A type and concentration of impurities in the precursor are directly related the optical properties of CsI:Tl crystals. The CsI:Tl crystals were grown in two levels of CsI and TlI reactant materials, i.e., having as a very high purity of 99.999%, showing a colorless crystal and a high purity of 99.9% showing an orange crystal. Absorption coefficient determined by transmittance and reflectance spectra was used to find an optical gap in the CsI:Tl crystals. For the colorless crystal, optical gaps of the Tl-related state and the CsI bandgap were observed at 3.82 eV and 5.14 eV, respectively. On the other hand, a merging of the Tl-related state and the CsI bandgap was observed for the orange crystal to form a virtual single bandgap at 3.51 eV. These results indicated the effects of precursor purity on optical gap of the CsI:Tl crystals.

High efficiency CuIn 1-x Ga x Se 2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells are usually deposited on Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates by the three-stage co-evaporation process which is intended to create double-graded band gap. It requires short total deposition time and rapid changing of substrate temperature in order to obtain the double-graded band gap which is quite difficult for high source-temperatures. When the total deposition time cannot be made short enough, uniform band gap is rather achieved. In this work, the depositions of CIS/CGS bilayer are employed in order to create back grading while CGS/CIS/CGS trilayers are for the double-grading, owing to non-uniformity and different diffusivity of In and Ga constituents in the films. The bilayers with back grading show the increasing short-circuit current density (J sc ) due to the assisting back surface field, but the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) is relatively low due to the reduction of Ga content at the front surface. For the CGS/CIS/CGS trilayers, double grading and the increasing of V oc are observed when compared with the bilayers due to the increasing Ga content near the junction. The efficiencies of the devices fabricated from the CIS/CGS bilayer and CGS/CIS/CGS trilayer absorbers show the maximum value of 12.5% and 15.5%, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the bilayer and trilayer absorbers exhibit the enhancement in the long wavelengths compared to that of the three-stage process absorbers."

['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Effects of global and local rewiring on SIS epidemic adaptive networks  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Adaptive epidemic network is generally driven by two main processes: (1) infection-recovery process that changes the states of the nodes, and (2) rewiring process that modifies the topology of the network. We consider an adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic on a network. In this work, a link is rewired randomly to a chosen susceptible node according to a prescribed global or local rewiring method. In the global rewiring case, a susceptible node could break the link with its infected neighbour to form a new link with another susceptible in the network. In this rewiring mechanism, the node must know health status of every other node in the network in order to rewire. This is however impractical in real life because the knowledge is only limited to a certain neighbouring group of nodes surrounding a given point. We propose a more realistic rewiring method called the local rewiring method, where a new link is limited to join a susceptible within a neighbouring distance. We investigate the impact of local versus global rewiring on an epidemic network. A new disease prevention behaviour emerges as a result."

In this work, two types of electrodes, including electroplated Ni film and Ni foam, were used as sensing electrodes for a non-enzymatic glucose sensor. The studied sensing properties of the Ni film and Ni foam included glucose-detecting sensitivity, selectivity, and detection limit. For the sensitivity and selectivity analysis, the sensing electrodes, with geometrical working area of 1 and 2 cm 2 for Ni foam and Ni film respectively, were submerged in a 1M NaOH solution, connected as a working electrode with Ag/AgCl and Pt as a reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Amperometric scanning measurement was used for the sensitivity and selectivity analysis. Sensitivity measurement was tested by dropping glucose solutions into 1M NaOH solution and recording the amperometric response of these sensor under varying sugar contents. The glucose-detection sensitivities are 1.1048 and 6.4228 mA mM -1 cm -2 for Ni plate and Ni foam, respectively. Limit of detection (LOD) of Ni film and Ni foam are 0.0072 and 0.0144 mM, respectively.

The CD is composed of thousands of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) used to detect light signals from neutrino induced interactions with liquid scintillator inside the CD. Another set of PMTs is used as water Cherenkov detector, together with muon top tracker forming the veto system for background rejection [1]. However, the PMTs' efficiency decreases when they are used in magnetic field. At JUNO's construction site, the Earth Magnetic Field (EMF) is approximately 0.45 G [2]. Therefore, the PMTs of JUNO detector are necessary to be shielded from the EMF. This work aims to design current-carrying coils that generate magnetic field in the opposite direction to the EMF, thus, the two fields tend to cancel each other. We found that the magnetic field generated by the 32 circular coils forming a sphere of diameter 43.5 m can reduce the residual magnetic field to be lower than 10% of the EMF at the CD region and less than 20% at the veto region. Moreover, considering the secular change of the EMF's inclination angle of approximately 2.87° over the 20 years of its operation, the coils can maintain the residual magnetic field both in the CD and the veto regions to be less than 10% and 20%, respectively."

We found that physics teachers agree with the experts in most categories, except conceptual connections, applied conceptual understanding and problem solving sophistication. While students tend to disagree with the experts in both conceptual categories and all 3 categories in problem solving. We then compare teachers' to students' responses from these two open-ended questions. On the difficulty aspect: 19% of students believe that difficulty in learning physics is due to incomprehension of physics concept. While 43% of teachers thought that difficulty in teaching physics is because of insufficiency of mathematics background. On the goals aspect, 37% of students aim to enter the university; while 50% of teachers target on helping student to better understand physics."
['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Cosmic-Ray Muons Detection by a Spark Chamber  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. Cosmic ray, originating from several galactic sources, bombards the Earth's atmosphere and produces lots of secondary particles. One of them is an unstable charged particle known as ""muon"" (μ ± ) with speed close to speed of light and lifetime about 2.2 microseconds before decaying into others. In this study, a spark chamber detector with a stack of 10 parallel electrode plates is constructed to detect the cosmic-ray muons which will lose their energies via ionization in the helium filled chamber. When muons passing through the chamber, they left their traces as the ionization paths. Sparks will occur immediately between each stack of parallel electrodes which are connected to a high voltage supply. The muon's trajectory can then be visualized by connecting the sparks in each stack. To construct this muon's path, two cameras are set to record the events from the two perpendicular planes on two sides of the chamber. The photos are analyzed using MATLAB to obtain the coordinates of the sparking tracks which then are used to determine the zenith angular distribution. The results show that a large number of muons arrived at our laboratory (Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand 13° 44'09.5""N 100°31'49.6""E) with zenith angle about 30°"

In this type of modified gravity model, the graviton has a non-zero mass leading to the naturally generated cosmological constant term. Therefore, this may bring about to an explanation for the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe without assuming any additional dark energy. The hydrostatic equilibrium (TOV) equation in this theory is derived to describe the structure of a spherical object such as a star. In this work, the generalized Buchdahl inequalities, providing the upper and lower limits of mass-radius ratio for high density compact objects, are obtained together with their crucial constraints. Finally, for theoretical testing these results may be proved in the context of astrophysical observations."

The excess glucose can be transformed to methylglyoxal (MG), a potential precursor of glycation. Glycation is a spontaneous non-enzymatic reaction that initially yields advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which ultimately triggers several severe complications. Therefore, the inhibition of AGEs formation is the imperative approach for alleviating diabetic complications. The aim of this research was to investigate the glycation and α-glucosidase inhibitory abilities of compounds isolated from fingerroot. The dichloromethane extract afforded three flavanones, two chalcones, two dihydrochalcones, and one kavalactone. Most of the isolated compounds showed higher inhibition effect against AGEs formation than aminoguanidine (AG). Subsequent evaluation in MG-trapping assay indicated that their trapping potency was relatively comparable to AG. Their structure-activity relationships (SAR) of MG-trapping activity were investigated using the comparison of the structures of flavonoids. In addition, pinocembrin displayed moderate α-glucosidase inhibition against both maltase and sucrose, with IC50 values of 0.35 ± 0.021 and 0.39 ± 0.020 mM, respectively."

Dolgov in the 1980s, these do not suffer from unacceptable variations of Newton's constant, as one aims at a small but strictly positive (rather than zero) late-time curvature.

Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate structural and dynamics characteristic of C4U in the membrane comparing with the SPEEK-hydronium membrane model as a control. From simulations, thermal effect on water and proton carriers cluster surrounding the sulfonate groups was explored. At higher temperature, the more transport dynamics of C4U ions in SPEEK membranes were found than that of hydronium ions in the control system.

The existing simplified effective length method could predict good results corresponding to test outcomes on TLCDs and LCVAs with small transition zones, but is found to yield larger discrepancy as larger transition zones are needed, often due to limited space constraints. The numerical panel method could be effectively employed to give more accurate results, but is not simple to formulate and needs to be re-modified for each new configuration. This paper proposes a new quasi-elliptic flow path estimation method to simulate control characteristics of TLCDs and LCVAs with relatively large transition boundary between the vertical columns and the horizontal cross-over duct, since liquid velocity's variation inside the large transition boundary cannot be assumed to occur at a single point. The simulation results are compared with experimental investigations conducted on a shake table, yielding satisfactorily better outcomes for large transition zones, as well as for small transition zones. This new formulation has been verified with a few other studies and has been found to be an excellent viable option with a respectable better, or at least comparable, accuracy level."

Ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the protein was approximately 55.4 kDa. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis and a subsequent sequence database search indicated the antifungal protein was most similar to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens vegetative catalase (KatA) protein. Light microscopy observation revealed that the antifungal protein induced abnormal hyphal elongation and conidial swelling and rupture. The protein considerably inhibited anthracnose development and protected the fruits from C. capsici infection. Thus, Bacillus sp. strain M10 and/or its putative catalase may be useful as a post-harvest biocontrol agent that protects chili pepper and tomato fruits from anthracnose disease caused by C. capsici."

Funded by SCOAP3.Measurements of fragmentation functions for jets associated with an isolated photon are presented for the first time in pp and Pb-Pb collisions. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. Fragmentation functions are obtained for jets with pTjet>30 GeV/c in events containing an isolated photon with pTγ>60 GeV/c, using charged tracks with transverse momentum pTtrk>1 GeV/c in a cone around the jet axis. The association with an isolated photon constrains the initial pT and azimuthal angle of the parton whose shower produced the jet. For central Pb-Pb collisions, modifications of the jet fragmentation functions are observed when compared to those measured in pp collisions, while no significant differences are found in the 50% most peripheral collisions. Jets in central Pb-Pb events show an excess (depletion) of low (high) pT particles, with a transition around 3 GeV/c. This measurement shows for the first time the in-medium shower modifications of partons (quark dominated) with well-defined initial kinematics. It constitutes a new well-controlled reference for testing theoretical models of the parton passage through the quark-gluon plasma."

We present the ideal commensurate value of 4/3 in Sc-II using ab initio calculations. We reveal that the 3c H and 4c G structures do interpenetrate and combine to the commensurate value of 4/3 of Sc-II at a pressure of 70 GPa. Ab initio molecular dynamics confirms the stability of the commensurate value 4/3 of the host-guest structure at 300 K and 72 GPa. The pressure-induced structural phase transitions in scandium under high pressure up to 200 GPa are investigated. We use ab initio random structure searching to predict the crystal structure of Sc-III: it is the tetragonal structure with space group P 4 1 2 1 2. Our calculations show that superconductivity arises in the P4 1 2 1 2 structure.

Diabetes is one of the leading threats of the health span of an individual. The present manuscript details the general methods of the production of FFs, and the results of various studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies) on the antidiabetic properties of FFs. The fermentation method and the active microbes involved in the process play a crucial role in the functional properties of FFs. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have been reported on the health-promoting properties of FFs, such as anti-inflammation, anticancer, antioxidant properties, improved cognitive function and gastrointestinal health, and the reduced presence of metabolic disorders. The studies on the functional properties of FFs by randomized controlled clinical trials using human volunteers are very limited for several reasons, including ethical reasons, safety concerns, approval from the government, etc. Several scientific teams are working on the development of complementary and alternative medicines to improve the treatment strategies for hyperglycemia."

The existence of these states can be probed at the LHC in high energy proton-proton collisions. A novel search is presented for pair production of LQs coupled to a top quark and a muon using data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1, recorded by the CMS experiment. No deviation from the standard model prediction has been observed and scalar LQs decaying exclusively into tμ are excluded up to masses of 1420 GeV. The results of this search are combined with those from previous searches for LQ decays into tτ and bν, which excluded scalar LQs below masses of 900 and 1080 GeV. Vector LQs are excluded up to masses of 1190 GeV for all possible combinations of branching fractions to tμ, tτ and bν.

KGaA, WeinheimSemiconductor photocatalysis is regarded as an ideal method for use in solving the energy shortage and environmental issues by converting solar energy to chemical energy. Herein, we have designed a facile synthetic methodology to obtain a ternary co-modified g-C3N4 composite via WS2 and carbon-doped TiO2 (C-TiO2) nanorods with highly efficient photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from deionized (DI) water and a natural seawater system under visible-light illumination. This composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine g-C3N4, WS2, C-TiO2 nanorods, and the reference-modified g-C3N4 composite with individual WS2 or C-TiO2 nanorods. Co-modified g-C3N4 composite shows a great photostability in both DI water and seawater. Under λ=420 nm monochromatic light illumination, the apparent quantum efficiency of the co-modified g-C3N4 composite in seawater solution is 13.08 %, which is higher than pure g-C3N4 (5.06 %). WS2, TiO2, and g-C3N4 constitute a ternary heterojunction boosting the fast separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, which plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the WS2 and C-TiO2 nanorod co-modified g-C3N4 composite with high photocatalytic performance provides a promising candidate for rationally utilizing the seawater resource to produce clean chemical energy."

The target motion, which may not have been seen by the agent and can be noisy, is supplied at runtime. Our method can recover balance from moderate external disturbances and keep imitating the target motion. When subjected to large disturbances that cause the humanoid to fall down, our method can control the character to get up and recover to track the motion. Our method is trained to imitate the mocap clips from the CMU motion capture database and a number of other publicly available databases. We use a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn to dynamically control the gain of PD controllers, whose target angles are derived from the mocap clip and to apply corrective torques with the goal of imitating the provided motion clip as closely as possible. Both the simulation and the learning algorithms are parallelized and run on the GPU. We demonstrate that the proposed method can control the character to imitate a wide variety of motions such as running, walking, dancing, jumping, kicking, punching, standing up, and so on."

Background: Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) regulates maintenance of stemness and modulation of osteo/odontogenic differentiation and mineralization in stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs). Mineralization in the bones and teeth is in part controlled by pericellular levels of inorganic phosphate (P i ), a component of hydroxyapatite, and inorganic pyrophosphate (PP i ), an inhibitor of mineralization. The progressive ankylosis protein (gene ANKH; protein ANKH) and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1/ENPP1) increase PP i and inhibit mineralization, while tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALPL; TNAP) is a critical pro-mineralization enzyme that hydrolyzes PP i . We hypothesized that regulation by bFGF of mineralization in SHEDs occurs by modulation of P i /PP i -associated genes. Methods: Cells were isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth and characterized for mesenchymal stem cell characteristics. Cells were treated with bFGF, and the osteogenic differentiation ability was determined. The mRNA expression was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The mineralization was examined using alizarin red S staining. Results: Cells isolated from primary teeth expressed mesenchymal stem cell markers, CD44, CD90, and CD105, and were able to differentiate into osteo/odontogenic and adipogenic lineages. Addition of 10 ng/ml bFGF to SHEDs during in vitro osteo/odontogenic differentiation decreased ALPL mRNA expression and ALP enzyme activity, increased ANKH mRNA, and decreased both P i /PP i ratio and mineral deposition. Effects of bFGF on ALPL and ANKH expression were detected within 24 h. Addition of 20 mM fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor SU5402 revealed the necessity of FGFR-mediated signaling, and inclusion of 1 μg/ml cyclohexamide (CHX) implicated the necessity of protein synthesis for effects on ALPL and ANKH. Addition of exogenous 10 μm PP i inhibited mineralization and increased ANKH, collagen type 1a1 (COL1A1), and osteopontin (SPP1) mRNA, while addition of exogenous P i increased mineralization and osterix (OSX), ANKH, SPP1, and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) mRNA. The effects of PP i and P i on mineralization could be replicated by short-term 3- and 7-day treatments, suggesting signaling effects in addition to physicochemical regulation of mineral deposition. Conclusion: This study reveals for the first time the effects of bFGF on P i /PP i regulators in SHEDs and implicates these factors in how bFGF directs osteo/odontogenic differentiation and mineralization by these cells."

Most of these studies have concentrated on using prediction accuracy as a performance metric. Some of them have also performed trading simulations to evaluate financial performance. However, financial performance was not improved significantly because the loss function used in the training process focused primarily on prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new framework to train a deep neural network for stock market prediction. A new loss function was developed by adding a risk-reward function, which is derived by the trading simulation results. A new scoring metric called Sharpe-F1 score, which is a combination of Sharpe ratio and F1 score is used for model selection. We employ the best prediction model from our previous work, which consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) architectures and takes event embedding vectors, historical prices and a set of technical indicators as inputs. The robustness of our framework is evaluated on two datasets by varying the key parameters used in the proposed framework. The results show that financial performance can be improved by adding a risk-reward function into the loss function used in the training process."

Design/methodology/approach: The research team evaluated the program in four selected villages from four regions using standard SROI. Relevant stakeholders were involved in the evaluation design and program impact map construction. Data, including costs, were collected from literatures, official documents, stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions. Alcohol abstinence and related data during and after the 2015 BL period were gathered from a survey questionnaire. The SROI ratio presented the social benefits compared against the total social investment. Findings: The program was effective in producing a greater social value (2.7–5.9 times) than the cost of investment in every village. Cost savings from alcohol consumption constituted a major proportion of the program’s value. Originality/value: The community-based alcohol consumption control program during BL can provide value for investment. Information from this study can be used by policy makers in their decision to continue or scale up the program. The SROI approach mainly relies on stakeholders that may present a bias; however, further study such as social cost-benefit analysis could provide additional insights."

Design/methodology/approach: A randomized crossover study of 21 healthy volunteers was designed to compare pharmacokinetic parameters of 1 g (B1) and 0.3 g (B0.3) of toothpaste without rinsing and brushing with 1 g of toothpaste with expectoration followed by water rinsing (B1R). Unstimulated saliva was collected before brushing as a baseline and at 0, 5, 10, 30, 60 and 90 min after the completion of the tooth brushing procedure. Findings: The salivary fluoride concentration and amount of soluble fluoride of the B1 group were significantly higher than the B0.3 and B1R groups. The B1 and B1R groups prolonged the remineralizing level up to 60 min while the B0.3 group retained their remineralizing levels for 30 min. The initial t1/2 (rapid phase) of B1 and B1R groups were significantly longer than the B0.3 group. The late t1/2 (slow phase) of the B0.3 group was significantly longer than the B1 group. This is called the two-compartment open pharmacokinetics model. There was no statistical difference of salivary flow rates between all groups. Originality/value: Non-rinsing and the amount of fluoride toothpaste play an important role in raising salivary fluoride levels and prolonging the remineralizing level of the oral cavity."

['Plant Science'],"Downstream components of the calmodulin signaling pathway in the rice salt stress response revealed by transcriptome profiling and target identification  2018 The Author(s).Background: Calmodulin (CaM) is an important calcium sensor protein that transduces Ca2+ signals in plant stress signaling pathways. A previous study has revealed that transgenic rice over-expressing the calmodulin gene OsCam1-1 (LOC_Os03g20370) is more tolerant to salt stress than wild type. To elucidate the role of OsCam1-1 in the salt stress response mechanism, downstream components of the OsCam1-1-mediated response were identified and investigated by transcriptome profiling and target identification. Results: Transcriptome profiling of transgenic 'Khao Dawk Mali 105' rice over-expressing OsCam1-1 and wild type rice showed that overexpression of OsCam1-1 widely affected the expression of genes involved in several cellular processes under salt stress, including signaling, hormone-mediated regulation, transcription, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glyoxylate cycle. Under salt stress, the photosynthesis rate in the transgenic rice was slightly lower than in wild type, while sucrose and starch contents were higher, suggesting that energy and carbon metabolism were affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression. Additionally, four known and six novel CaM-interacting proteins were identified by cDNA expression library screening with the recombinant OsCaM1. GO terms enriched in their associated proteins that matched those of the differentially expressed genes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression revealed various downstream cellular processes that could potentially be regulated by OsCaM1 through their actions. Conclusions: The diverse cellular processes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression and possessed by the identified CaM1-interacting proteins corroborate the notion that CaM signal transduction pathways compose a complex network of downstream components involved in several cellular processes. These findings suggest that under salt stress, CaM activity elevates metabolic enzymes involved in central energy pathways, which promote or at least maintain the production of energy under the limitation of photosynthesis."

Publication rights licensed to Association for Computing Machinery.We propose a workflow for spectral reproduction of paintings, which captures a painting's spectral color, invariant to illumination, and reproduces it using multi-material 3D printing. We take advantage of the current 3D printers' capabilities of combining highly concentrated inks with a large number of layers, to expand the spectral gamut of a set of inks. We use a data-driven method to both predict the spectrum of a printed ink stack and optimize for the stack layout that best matches a target spectrum. This bidirectional mapping is modeled using a pair of neural networks, which are optimized through a problem-specific multi-objective loss function. Our loss function helps find the best possible ink layout resulting in the balance between spectral reproduction and colorimetric accuracy under a multitude of illuminants. In addition, we introduce a novel spectral vector error diffusion algorithm based on combining color contoning and halftoning, which simultaneously solves the layout discretization and color quantization problems, accurately and efficiently. Our workflow outperforms the state-of-the-art models for spectral prediction and layout optimization. We demonstrate reproduction of a number of real paintings and historically important pigments using our prototype implementation that uses 10 custom inks with varying spectra and a resin-based 3D printer."

All rights reserved.The purpose of this research was to study the physical and economic characteristics of carbonized briquettes from rain tree (Samanea saman) residues and coffee ground/tea waste with cassava starch (10% wt.). This experiment utilized five treatments. As a binder, 10% wt. cassava starch was added to five ratios of rain tree residues to coffee ground/tea waste: RT100:CT0, RT75:CT25, RT50:CT50, RT25:CT75, and RT0:CT100. The physical properties of the carbonized briquettes were analyzed using ASTM methods. The results showed that carbonized briquettes made from 50% rain tree (Samanea saman) residues and 50% coffee ground/tea waste (RT50:CT50) had the highest calorific value (20.17 ± 0.042 MJ/kg)—insignificant at the 95% confidence interval—and highest shatter index (99.16 ± 0.20%). However, all ratios of rain tree residues to coffee ground/tea waste can produce carbonized briquettes for household use, convenient for transportation. In terms of economic performance, carbonized briquettes made from 50% rain tree (Samanea saman) residues and 50% coffee ground/tea waste (RT50:CT50) achieved the optimal payback period (approximately six months).

All rights reserved.This paper studies a two-level inventory system with one warehouse and N retailers under seasonal demand. All locations apply periodic review base-stock policy with echelon stock concept. The objective is to determine an inventory policy with the minimum inventory cost respected to required service level. Three ways to determine inventory policies are proposed which are upper, lower and EOQ alternatives. Among these alternatives, it is found that upper-alternative policies tend to give the lowest cost which is around 17% lower than other policies. EOQ-alternative policies give the lowest cost in some instances with zero ordering cost. However, lower-alternative policies lead to the lower demand loss, its highest average loss in one instance is 0.07% while other policies’ loss can be as high as 0.22%."

The present study applies the reference stress method to extend the J-integral solution from the finite element analysis for the Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain relationship to other types of stress-strain relationship. The problem in this study is an extrados circumferential through-wall crack at the interface between elbow and pipe subjected to internal pressure. The finite element results from the literature were analyzed to determine the optimized reference pressure. The fracture loads predicted by the reference-stress-based failure assessment curve which incorporated with the optimized reference pressure were compared with those predicted by the finite-element-based failure assessment curve. The failure load predicted from the reference-stress-based failure assessment curve deviated from that predicted from the finite-element-based failure assessment curve within the range of-7% to 11%."

All rights reserved.The rapid adoption of the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) technology in our modern daily life brings the opportunity to investigate its applicability to areas beyond positioning, navigation and timing, such as meteorology. Due to its high accuracy performance, GNSS (PPP) Precise Point Positioning has become an attractive tool to retrieve the precipitable water vapor (PWV) from the atmosphere. Apart of the GNSS observations, PPP PWV retrieval also requires surface pressure and temperature measurements to calculate precisely the wet part of the tropospheric delay and convert it to PWV. This research reports on the atmospheric water estimation using GNSS PPP method. GNSS observations from CUSV IGS tracking station are combined with IGS precise data in order to obtain the best PPP estimates. Forward and backward solutions are combined using a weighted normalized approach. In addition, observation data from two meteorological stations is used in PWV estimation. The numerical analysis covered the entire year of 2016. Our analyses show that PPP combined solutions are in very good agreement with IGS official products in terms of coordinates and zenith tropospheric delays. In addition, PPP PWV estimates display seasonal and temporal variation in the water content of the atmosphere. The PWV values over 65 mm were found to be from May to November, whereas they were on average 20% lower for the other months of the year. Furthermore, PWV estimates were found to be correlated with local rainfall events recorded at the meteorological stations. Our research concludes that GNSS data processing using PPP method provides high accuracy solution that may be used for retrieving reliably information about the water content in the atmosphere."

All rights reserved.A novel formulation consisting of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spores mixed with sterilized organic fertilizer (AMF-F) encapsulated by an insoluble calcium alginate film was developed to enhance AMF efficacy and stability. The hardness of the pellets increased from 7–8 N to approximately 80 N by increasing the alginate concentration of the coating film from 1 to 3%. The AMF spore germination rate for the AMF and AMF-F pellets coated with calcium alginate films depended on the alginate concentration. A 2% sodium alginate formulation for the coating films resulted in optimal AMF spore germination rates and mechanical properties for handling, transport, and stability. The inclusion of a sterilized organic fertilizer in the encapsulated AMF-F pellets considerably induced AMF mycelial growth and helped prolong the shelf life of the pellets. In soil, the AMF-F pellets encapsulated with alginate (cAMF-F) initially degraded faster than the alginate-encapsulated AMF pellets (cAMF). However, both types of pellets were fully degraded within 30 days. It was demonstrated that cAMF and cAMF-F could promote colonization and provided resistance to drought stress in maize potted plants."

All rights reserved.Thailand currently ranks third among the most water-intensive countries in the world. The percentage shares of water demand in the country’s agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors, which are major economic sectors, are 75%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. With the continuous growth of the economy, the demand for water is steadily rising, while the expansion of water supply remains constrained by several factors and the water supply is also affected by climate change. This study uses the input–output model to examine the relationship between water usage and the economic system in Thailand in 2010. The constructed input–output model is the integration of the Leontief inverse matrix, the matrix of water usage, and the details of the gross domestic product (GDP). The model indicates the linkage between GDP expansion and water demand in both direct and indirect usage. The computation result obtained from the model indicates that the agricultural sector is the major water user, with its ratio of direct water use being the highest. The manufacturing sector records the highest ratio of indirect water use, which is influenced by its supply chain comprising the agriculture and service sectors. This model and its results may serve as the main foundation for the design of economic and environmental policies oriented toward optimizing water demand and supply. The model can also be extended and enriched with detailed mechanisms of economic behavior to allow further complex analyzes such as water pricing policies."

This model was created to fill information gaps of older models. In addition, the model provides the unique feature of viable model application for different sectors in various contexts. The model revealed all exogenous variables that have direct and indirect influences over changes in CO2 emissions. The variables show a direct effect at a confidence interval of 99%, including per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1), labor growth (Δln(L)t-1), urbanization rate factor (Δln(URT)t-1), industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1), energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1), foreign direct investment (Δln(FDI)t-1), oil price (Δln(OP)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1). In addition, it was found that every variable in the SEM-VECM model has an indirect effect on changes in CO2 emissions at a confidence interval of 99%. The SEM-VECM model has the ability to adjust to the equilibrium equivalent to 39%. However, it also helps to identify the degree of direct effect that each causal factor has on the others. Specifically, labor growth (Δln(L)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) and energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, while urbanization rate (Δln(URT)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1), labor growth (Δln(L)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Furthermore, industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, whereas energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Foreign direct investment (Δln(FDI)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, while oil price (Δln(OP)t-1) had a direct effect on industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1), energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Lastly, net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. The model eliminates the problem of heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, and autocorrelation. In addition, it was found that the model is white noise. When the SEM-VECM Model was used for 30-year forecasting (2018-2047), it projected that CO2 emissions would increase steadily by 67.04% (2047/2018) or 123.90 Mt CO2 Eq. by 2047. The performance of the SEM-VECM Model was assessed and produced a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.21% and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.02%. When comparing the performance value with the values of other, older models, the SEM-VECM Model was found to be more effective and useful for future research and policy planning for Thailand's sustainability goals."

Design/methodology/approach: The acetylated PW-MCC was produced from heterogeneous condition using planetary ball mill process at a rotation speed of 400 rpm. Before the esterification reaction, PW-MCC was pre-treated with pyridine at 60°C for 1 h in order to penetrate and swell the cellulose structure. The optimum condition of esterified PW-MCC with various molar ratios of benzoyl chloride/anhydroglucose unit (AGU) was studied. The degree of substitution, functional group, thermal stability and morphology of esterified cellulose were characterized by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings: The functional group from FTIR confirmed that PW-MCC was successfully esterified with benzoyl chloride. The optimum condition which gave the maximum degree of substitution at 3.00 was achieved by using benzoyl chloride/AGU at 5 for 1 h. SEM analysis revealed that the modified PW-MCC surface became rougher than the unmodified PW-MCC surface. The polypropylene composites with 5-30 wt% PW-MCC and esterified PW-MCC were prepared without compatibilizer.

EFB has been known as a low-priced and abandoned residue from the palm oil milling process due to its low heating value and generation of toxic gases upon burning; therefore, valorization of EFB has been an important task for circular economy. In this study, a subsequent alkaline hot compressed water fractionation to separate hemicellulose and lignin from cellulose has been studied. The lignin separation by lignin precipitation and a filtration process followed by microwave-assisted lignin oxidative depolymerization to high value phenolic compounds was proposed. We systematically screened many catalysts as well as investigated reaction conditions (such as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, reaction time, etc.) to achieve the highest yield of lignin-derived phenolic compounds. It was found that the optimal conditions for depolymerization of pretreated EFB lignin were (i) NaOH solution with 2.5% (w/w) hydrogen peroxide, (ii) microwave (300 W) for 15 min, and (iii) bimetallic Cu(OH)2 and Fe2O3 catalysts. The highest percentage of the total phenolic compound concentration peak area is 91.78%, including 42.84% of syringol, 5.42% of vanillin, 8.71% of acetovanillone, 6.65% of syringaldehyde, and 28.16% of acetosyringone.

Hydrogen is regarded as the right energy carrier to meet future conditions, and hence, developing hydrogen economy is intensively investigated for its great electrocatalytic property. However, it is blocked as an electrocatalyst due to its poor conductivity and electrochemical activity. Therefore, to conquer such shortcomings, changing the nanostructure and increasing active sites are studied. Here, we report a facile method by incorporation of nickel boride (Ni2B) nanoparticles into bulk g-C3N4 to enlarge the specific surface area, exfoliate the layers, and improve the electronic conductivity. The obtained catalysts exhibit better hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low onset overpotential of 300 mV, a Tafel slope of 221 mV dec-1, and an overpotential of 707 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, superior to original g-C3N4 which demonstrates that Ni2B-decorated g-C3N4 is an illuminating method to enhance the HER performance.

All rights reserved.This study determined the efficacy of recombinant HVT- NDV (rHVT- NDV) vaccine simultaneously vaccinated with live vaccine at 1 day old and a booster vaccination with live vaccine at 10 days old against Asiatic, Genotype VII NDV in broiler chickens. The chickens were divided into 5 groups. The chickens in groups 1, 2 and 3 were vaccinated with rHVT- NDV vaccine and different live vaccines at 1 day old, and then finally received a booster vaccination at 10 days old. The chickens in groups 4 and 5 served as the positive and negative control groups, respectively. The chickens in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were challenged with NDV at 14, 21, 28 and 35 days old, 20 chickens of each group at a time. Clinical signs and mortality were observed for 14 days after each time of challenge. Blood samples were collected at 1 and 10 days old, on the virus inoculation day and 14 days post- inoculation, to determine NDV antibodies. Swab samples were collected from the chickens challenged with the virus at 35 days old to detect NDV RNA by real- time PCR. The results reveal that the protection rate of the vaccinated chickens, which were challenged at 14 days old was 70- 95%, while the protection rate of all vaccinated groups increased to 90- 100% when they were challenged at 21, 28 or 35 days old. The vaccinated groups had a lower rate of virus shedding when compared to the challenged control group. It is concluded that all of the vaccination programs of rHVT-NDV vaccine in this study could be used to reduce economic loss due to infection by Genotype VII NDV."

An outbreak investigation, based on the detection of the classical variant and the allowance of the herd owners, was conducted in 5 swine herds and 25 intestinal samples were submitted from herds with outbreaks of diarrhea for sequencing analysis. PEDV isolation and complete nucleotide sequences of the spike (S) glycoprotein were determined. The PEDV isolate EAS1 was identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length spike gene demonstrated that EAS1 belonged to the classical variant group with high nucleotide and amino acid identity (98.4-99.0% and 96.6-97.9%) with LZC and SM98, which are the Chinese and Korean classical variant PEDVs, respectively. The results suggest the emergence of a classical variant PEDV responsible for the mild clinical disease in Thailand.

All rights reserved.Feline adrenal disorders that affect the size of the adrenal glands can be detected by diagnostic imaging including ultrasonography and Computed Tomography (CT). The objectives of this study were to compare the appearance of the adrenal gland in healthy cats between these two techniques and establish the reference values of the CT dimensions of the adrenal gland in cats. We found that there was no significant difference in the length of both adrenal glands between the two techniques but the cranial and caudal heights of the left adrenal glands and cranial height of the right adrenal gland obtained from the CT images in post-contrast enhanced-phase were significantly thicker than those obtained from ultrasonography. Our results suggest the reference values (mean±SD) of the left adrenal gland length, cranial, and caudal heights as 11.12 ± 2.65, 3.69 ± 0.72, and 3.70 ± 0.77 mm, respectively, and those of the right adrenal gland as 11.00 ± 2.33, 3.80 ± 0.99, and 3.53 ± 0.73 mm, respectively. The dimensions of both adrenal glands obtained from ultrasonography have more positive correlation with the age and body weight of the cats when compared with those obtained from the CT. Different sensitivity between the two techniques might be the cause and the images obtained from ultrasonography might be affected by the positioning and bodyweight of the patient."

All rights reserved.Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus are important mosquito vectors for many infectious diseases. A number of factors affect the vector competence of these mosquitoes for a specific pathogen. The bacteria harbored in the midgut are known to influence mosquito physiology and can alter the response to various pathogens. Bacteria from the midgut of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus were cultured and identified using bacteriological and molecular techniques in this study in which two groups of mosquitoes were examined. The first group was laboratory- reared, and the second group were field- collected mosquitoes from Bangkok. Twelve bacterial genera (i. e., Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium, Bacillus, Cellulomonas, Chryseomicrobium, Dietzia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Microbacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus) were identified from laboratory- reared Ae. aegypti and eight bacterial genera (i. e., Bacillus, Cellulomonas, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Moraxella, Neisseria, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) were determined from field- collected Ae. aegypti. Five bacterial genera (i. e., Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus) were identified from laboratory- reared Cx. quinquefasciatus and 13 bacterial genera (i. e., Acinetobacter, Actinomyces, Bacillus, Chryseobacterium, Kocuria, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Novosphingobium, Pantoea, Providencia, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Staphylococcus) were examined from field- collected Cx. quinquefasciatus. The variation of these midgut microbiota may influence mosquito vector competence for a specific pathogen. However, further studies need to be performed to indicate this relationship."

This condition can cause serious life-threatening problems if not diagnosed and treated properly. Case presentation: We report an unusual case of a 79-year-old Thai male, who was diagnosed with concomitant mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm and lumbar tuberculous spondylitis at the L2–L3 level with left psoas abscess and cauda equina syndrome. The surgical plan was radical surgical debridement via transpsoas approach and the defect was filled with iliac crest strut graft and posterior decompressive laminectomy and fusion with a pedicle screws and rods system. During the operation, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was iatrogenically ruptured and then was emergently treated with endovascular stent graft implantation. Subsequently, hemostasis was achieved and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. A few days later, he underwent posterior decompressive laminectomy L2–L3, fusion and instrumentation with a pedicle screws and rods system at T11-L5. After surgery, the patient recovered well and his motor power improved gradually. He was continually treated with anti-tuberculous chemotherapy for 12 months. Discussion: Concomitant mycotic aortic aneurysm and lumbar tuberculous spondylitis with psoas abscess and cauda equina syndrome is an extremely rare condition that requires prompt diagnosis and management. Its consequences can lead to serious complications such as permanent neurological damage, paralysis or even death, if left untreated. The aims of the treatment are to eradicate infection, to prevent further neurological compromise, to stabilize the spine and to protect the aortic aneurysm from rupture."

All rights reserved.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common myocardial disease in cats. Nowadays, there is no study determining the survival time of cats affected with HCM in Thailand. This study aimed to evaluate the survival time in HCM cats with congestive heart failure (CHF) in Thailand and to determine the factors associating with survival time. A retrospective study was performed in 47 HCM cats to analyze survival time and the association of survival time and factors including sex, age, breeds, weight, physical findings, the presence of complications, medication and echocardiographic findings. The data was analyzed by the Log-Rank test and displayed with the Kaplan-Meier curve. The results reveal that the median survival time of HCM cats with CHF was 283 days and factors associating with a lesser survival time were the presence of aortic thromboembolism (ATE), a decrease in left ventricular internal dimension at end-diastole (LVIDd) < 10.8 mm and the use of other cardiovascular drugs besides the combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and furosemide. The data of this study is valuable for prognosis and for the future management of HCM cats with CHF."

All rights reserved.Within the last decade, the positive effects of Pueraria mirifica on osteoporosis have been established in rats and monkeys. However, the effect of P. mirifica on bone healing has not been elucidated. In this study, post-menopausal osteoporotic monkeys were subjected to an iliac crest biopsy, divided into two groups (5 animals/group), and fed daily with standard monkey diet alone (PMP0 group) or mixed with 1,000 mg/kg body weight of P. mirifica powder (PMP1000 group) for 16 months. The progression of the bone healing was continuously assessed by X-ray radiography, and three individuals from each group were selected for a computed tomographic (CT) scan at 0, 8 and 16 months. The individual from each group that showed the greatest progression of bone healing, based upon the CT image, was selected for a second biopsy of the right ilium after 16 months of treatment and histological changes determined. The perimeter and area measured by the X-ray radiograph were significantly decreased earlier in the PMP1000 group compared to the PMP0 group, and the significant differences of the perimeter between the groups were detected in month 3, 6 and 8. The 3D-CT scan showed a progressive bone healing in one PMP1000 individual, while histological examination indicated a lower number of fibrocartilage cells and a higher amount of new bone formation compared to the PMP0 monkey. In conclusion, PMP treatment could accelerate the progression of bone fracture healing in naturally postmenopausal osteoporotic monkeys, in addition to the previously reported amelioration of bone loss."

Using a notion of augmented clause every symmetric version can be learned. The task of unit propagation is then transformed into a search problem under a permutation group. Our work focuses on a special kind of symmetry called row symmetry. We present the optimization to the search problem under a group containing row symmetry subgroups mainly relies on lexicographic pruning and the fact that some instances can be reduced to minimal assignment problems. We also introduce a construction of subgroups of row symmetry groups to ensure that every sub-task could be performed in polynomial time. Lastly, we discuss the implementation of our technique and some of the technical issue that needed to be address."

Unfortunately, division seem to have many disadvantages in the case that a denominator contains many terms. A single term representation for any number is investigated in this work. We proposed an approximation algorithm for reducing a number of terms, especially for an integer. We also proposed a division algorithm together with the proof of correctness.

ASAGAO is a deep (1 σ depth ∼ 61 μJy beam−1 for a 250 kλ-tapered map with a synthesized beam size of 0.51 × 0.45) and wide area (26 arcmin2) survey on a contiguous field at 1.2 mm. By combining with ALMA archival data in the GOODS-South field, we obtained a deeper map in the same region (1 σ depth ∼ 30 μJy beam−1 for a deep region with a 250 kλ-taper, and a synthesized beam size of 0.59 × 0.53), providing the largest sample of sources (25 sources at ≥5.0 σ, 45 sources at ≥4.5 σ) among ALMA blank-field surveys to date. The number counts show that 52+−118 % of the extragalactic background light at 1.2 mm is resolved into discrete sources at S1.2 mm > 135 μJy. We create infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) in the redshift range of z = 1–3 from the ASAGAO sources with Ks-band counterparts, and constrain the faintest luminosity of the LF at 2.0 < z < 3.0. The LFs are consistent with previous results based on other ALMA and SCUBA-2 observations, which suggest a positive luminosity evolution and negative density evolution with increasing redshift. We find that obscured star-formation of sources with IR luminosities of log (LIR/L) 11.8 account for ≈60%–90% of the z ∼ 2 cosmic star-formation rate density."

"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Signal Processing']","Refactoring orchestrated web services into microservices using decomposition pattern  2018 IEEE.Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural design of inter-services collaborations. In general, SOA has three major roles, including client, service provider, and service broker. To access a service usually depends on a service broker, which causes inflexibility in system modification. The software industry now focuses more on productivity, flexibility of the constant changes and continuous modifications, for which the SOA style may not be suitable. Therefore, a new microservice style is an alternative serving those needs, which means a microservice unit is more adaptable and replaceable with no ripple effects. Since the microservice architecture design is considered as a collection of the small self-contained services, each service represents a business capability and carries its own isolated data. However, how to identify microservices is still a challenging task in the business process model level. This paper proposes an alternative mean to extract the existing SOA services from the BPEL flow and refactor them into a set of relevant microservices using the decomposition pattern. In our case study, we propose how to do the service refactoring against the business domain profiles collected from the extracted vocabularies from the given business scenarios. The resulting microservices are domain specific and conform to the business capability vocabularies extracted from the given business scenarios."

Recent Findings: Skin barrier function relies on the stratum corneum (SC) and tight junction. These components are deranged in the AD epidermis. Deficiency in filaggrin gives rise to abnormal epidermal integrity. The intercellular lipid composition, ratio, and organization are found to be disturbed. Keratinocyte shedding from the SC is also impaired. Tight junction proteins are reduced and result in sweat leakage into the skin surface. Summary: Strategies to enhance skin barrier strength will alleviate AD symptoms and may prevent the disease."

Encountered here in both primary and secondary placer deposits is a considerable quantity of stones with a well-developed spinel corona following the morphology of the corundum core. The genesis of the observed spinel corona can be explained by their reaction textures, chemical composition, and mineral inclusions as well as by applying thermodynamic phase equilibria calculations. The following reactions were found to be responsible for the formation of the spinel corona around corundum in gneiss: biotite + corundum → spinel + K-feldspar + fluid, or garnet+corundum → spinel + sillimanite For corundum-spinel associations in metacarbonate rocks, the relevant reaction is: dolomite + corundum → spinel + calcite + carbon dioxide Mineralogical and chemical studies have shown that the gem quality of ruby and sapphire grains from Tan Huong-Truc Lau deteriorated substantially after their formation due to this corona texture."

All rights reserved.Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases. These viruses are transmitted to humans through the bites of Aedes mosquitoes. Recently, ZIKV infection has been described as an emerging disease in Thailand and many countries, especially in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Specific drugs and vaccines against these infections are unavailable; therefore, effective disease control relies on vector control measures only. To understand the transmission cycle of these viruses and mosquito vectors, this study is designed to investigate the natural infection of ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV in field-caught mosquitoes by molecular techniques. Adults and larvae of mosquitoes were collected in and around the patients' homes in the Klaeng District, Rayong Province, Thailand. CHIKV and DENV were detected by Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR and ZIKV was detected by Hemi-nested RT-PCR. ZIKV RNA was detected in 8 (10.3%) samples (5 (6.4%) females and 2 (2.6%) males of Aedes aegypti and 1 (1.3%) female Armigeres subalbatus) and CHIKV RNA in 5 (6.4%) (3 (3.8%) females and 2 (2.6%) larvae of Ae. aegypti), while DENV RNA was not detected in any samples. The Maximum Likelihood tree of nucleotide sequences of positive samples showed that ZIKV in mosquitoes were cladded within the Asian lineage. This study was a preliminary survey of the potential vectors of ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV in an affected area. Information obtained from this study helps to understand the natural infection rates in mosquitoes with ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV and may be valuable in creating the most effective mosquito vector control strategies in the future."

All Rights Reserved.Neurological diseases are one of the serious health hazards faced by mankind for decades. Neurite outgrowth is a key factor responsible for proper neuronal development. Any misplacement in the process could lead to neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Treatment with the available synthetic drugs imparts many difficulties to the patients due to the side effects. Compounds from natural sources can be considered as an effective replacement for this. Mucuna pruriens, used in traditional ayurvedic medicine, contains L-3,4-dihydroxy phenylalanine (L-DOPA) in its seeds, which possesses medicinal effects against neurological diseases. In this regard, seed extracts of M. pruriens originated from Thailand and India, were analyzed for their neuroprotective effects in Neuro2a cells. Hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts were found to be non-toxic to the viability of the cells. Ethanol extracts of M. pruriens of Thai origin (MTE), hexane extracts of M. pruriens of Indian origin (MIH) and ethyl acetate extracts of M. pruriens of Indian origin (MIEA) were able to induce neurite outgrowth in Neuro2a cells. Interestingly, both MTE and MIH induced neurite outgrowth dependent on Teneurin-4 (Ten-4) transmembrane protein whereas MIEA did the same independent of Ten-4, which was confirmed by real time PCR and gene silencing approach. The present study suggested that M. pruriens can be used as a potential drug in the treatment of neurological diseases as it can induce neurite outgrowth by multiple mechanisms, which will be of great use in the field of medicine."

The emergence of carbapenem resistance in non-baumannii Acinetobacter has increased in clinical settings worldwide. We investigated the prevalence and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in A. pittii and A. nosocomialis Thai isolates. Methodology. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (Acb) complex isolates were identified by gyrB mulitplex PCR. Carbapenem susceptibilities were studied by the agar dilution method and carbapenemase genes were detected by multiplex PCR. Reductions of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Overexpressions of efflux pumps were detected by using efflux pump inhibitors and RT-PCR. Results. Of the 346 Acb isolates, 22 and 19 were A. pittii and A. nosocomialis, respectively. The carbapenem resistance rates were 22.7% in A. pittii and 26.3% in A. nosocomialis. Three carbapenem-resistant A. pittii carried bla OXA-23 . One carbapenemresistant A. pittii harboured blaOXA-58, while another isolate co-harboured blaOXA-58 and blaIMP-14a. bla OXA-58 was also found in three carbapenem-susceptible A. pittii. Five carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis carried bla OXA-23 . Eighteen A. pittii isolates carried bla OXA-213-like . Reduced OMPs were found in carbapenem-resistant and -susceptible A. pittii carrying blaOXA-58, but were not detected in carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis isolates. Overexpression of adeE was found in carbapenemresistant A. pittii. No efflux pump genes were present in carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis. Conclusion. The major mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in A. pittii and A. nosocomialis were the production of OXA-23 and OXA-58. Overexpression of adeE played a role in carbapenem resistance in A. pittii. Since blaOXA-58 was found in carbapenem-susceptible A. pittii, using carbapenems in the treatment of A. pittii infection should be considered."

Efforts have been made in recent years to understand various aspects of VP40 structure, dynamics, and function such as assembly of the protein and its roles in virus replication and penetration of the protein into the plasma membrane. A major conformational transformation is necessary for VP40 to form some of its oligomeric structures and to perform various functions. This conformational change from a compact structure with the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) closely associated involves a dissociation or springing-out of the CTD from the NTD. We perform investigations using computational molecular dynamics simulations as well as knowledge-based Monte Carlo simulations. We find that a sharp springing of the CTD from the NTD in a free VP40 protein cannot occur solely by random thermal fluctuations without intermediate oligomerized segments, and therefore is likely triggered by additional molecular events."

['Structural Biology'],"Determining the amphipol distribution within membrane-protein fibre samples using small-angle neutron scattering  Arunmanee et al. 2018Detergent micelles can solubilize membrane proteins, but there is always a need for a pool of free detergent at the critical micellar concentration to maintain the micelle–monomer equilibrium. Amphipol polymeric surfactants (APols) have been developed to replace conventional detergents in membrane-protein studies, but the role of free amphipol is unclear. It has previously been shown that the removal of free APol causes monodisperse outer membrane protein F (OmpF) to form long filaments. However, any remaining APol could not be resolved using electron microscopy. Here, small-angle neutron scattering with isotope contrast matching was used to separately determine the distributions of membrane protein and amphipol in a mixed sample. The data showed that after existing free amphipol had been removed from monodisperse complexes, a new equilibrium was established between protein–amphipol filaments and a pool of newly liberated free amphipol. The filaments consisted of OmpF proteins surrounded by a belt of Apol, whilst free oblate spheroid micelles of Apol were also present. No indications of long-range order were observed, suggesting a lack of defined structure in the filaments."

The measurements are consistent with the standard model expectations."
['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"Search for pair-produced resonances decaying to quark pairs in proton-proton collisions at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN.A general search for the pair production of resonances, each decaying to two quarks, is reported. The search is conducted separately for heavier resonances (masses above 400 GeV), where each of the four final-state quarks generates a hadronic jet resulting in a four-jet signature, and for lighter resonances (masses between 80 and 400 GeV), where the pair of quarks from each resonance is collimated and reconstructed as a single jet resulting in a two-jet signature. In addition, a b-tagged selection is applied to target resonances with a bottom quark in the final state. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1, from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The mass spectra are analyzed for the presence of new resonances, and are found to be consistent with standard model expectations. The results are interpreted in the framework of R-parity-violating supersymmetry assuming the pair production of scalar top quarks decaying via the hadronic coupling λ312′′ or λ323′′ and upper limits on the cross section as a function of the top squark mass are set. These results probe a wider range of masses than previously explored at the LHC, and extend the top squark mass limits in the t→qq′ scenario."

METHODS: We conducted multi-center, observational study in severe asthma patients who received omalizumab in Thailand. Outcomes were asthma exacerbation (hospitalization and ER visit), asthma control test (ACT), and daily ICS dose. Data were evaluated at baseline, 16 Week, and 52 Week. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients received omalizumab treatment (average duration 16.9 months with range 16 weeks-2 years). The mean annualized rate of exacerbations was reduced from baseline (3.79) at Week 16 (3.54) and Week 52 (1.16), (p<0.05), respectively. The mean hospitalization rate was reduced from 0.49 in previous year to 0.15 at Week 16 and 0.19 at Week 52. A reduction in ER visit rates was observed at Week 16 (0.15) and Week 52 (0.97) respectively from baseline (1.44) (p<0.05). The ACT score increased from 15.4 at baseline to 20.6 at Week 16 (p<0.001) and increased to 21.5 at Week 52 (p<0.001). The number of patients with controlled asthma (ACT≥20) increased from 16 of 51 at baseline to 32 of 45 at Week 16 and 25 of 32 at week 52, respectively. The median daily dose of ICS equivalent to fluticasone was reduced from baseline 680 mcg to 500 mcg at Week 52. In all, 22 patients discontinued omalizumab after 1 year. Six patients who discontinued omalizumab were restarted due to relapse of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirms the effectiveness of one-year duration of omalizumab treatment in Thai severe asthmatic patients. Furthermore, 27% of patients who discontinued treatment required restarting due to relapse of symptoms."
"['Immunology and Allergy', 'Immunology']","Randomized comparison of caregivers' ability to use epinephrine autoinjectors and prefilled syringes for anaphylaxis BACKGROUND: Caregivers often incorrectly use epinephrine autoinjectors. It is unclear whether this is due to insufficient training or a difficult-to-use tool. Furthermore, the high costs of epinephrine autoinjectors may limit their availability; so low-cost prefilled syringes may be the alternative. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized trial to compare successful epinephrine administration at four stages: after reading written instructions, and immediately after, 6 weeks, and 3 months following video training. The time required for successful epinephrine administration and failed steps in the administration of epinephrine autoinjectors and prefilled syringe were also investigated. RESULTS: Complete data analysis of 113 participants (prefilled syringe group, n=57; EpiPen, n=56) was performed. Significantly more participants correctly demonstrated the use of prefilled syringes compared to EpiPen after reading instructions, and immediately following 6 weeks, and 3 months after video training. ((adjusted OR 26.17 (95%CI 8.2583.04), adjusted OR 4.07 (95%CI 1.29-12.86), adjusted OR 14.01 (95%CI 3.62-54.22)) and adjusted OR 31.44 (95%CI 5.73172.39), respectively) Four key step errors would likely result in failure of administration and were more common with EpiPen (14.0% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in time of successful administration between the two groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Epinephrine prefilled syringe was significantly easier to use with a higher rate of correct use compared to EpiPen over time. All four key step errors in the administration were more likely with EpiPen. The time required for successful epinephrine administration was not significantly different."
"['Immunology and Allergy', 'Immunology']","Effects of aerobic exercise and vitamin C supplementation on rhinitis symptoms in allergic rhinitis patients INTRODUCTION: Exercise training and vitamin C supplementation have both been recommended as an effective adjuvant treatment in the management of symptoms in patients with many diseases. However, its effects on rhinitis symptoms remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of exercise training alone, and in combination with vitamin C supplementation, on rhinitis symptoms in allergic rhinitis patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven rhinitis patients were randomized into 3 groups: control (CON; n = 8), exercise (EX; n = 9), and exercise combined with vitamin C (EX + Vit.C; n = 10). The exercise training protocol consisted of walking and/or running on a treadmill at 65-70% heart rate reserve for 30 min per session, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The EX + Vit.C group ingested 2,000 mg vitamin C per day. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, both EX and EX + Vit.C groups increased peak aerobic capacity and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and exhibited significantly decreased rhinitis symptoms, nasal blood flow (NBF) and malondialdehylde levels compared to pre-test. Rhinitis symptoms and NBF after nasal challenge with house dust mite decreased significantly in the EX and EX + Vit.C groups. The EX and EX + Vit.C groups had significantly lower nasal secretion interleukin (IL)-4, but higher nasal secretion IL-2 levels, than the CON group. CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly confirms that aerobic exercise training significantly improved clinical of allergic rhinitis and cytokine profiles. Nonetheless, with the limited power of small sample size, whether adding vitamin C is any beneficial is not shown. A larger randomized controlled trial is thus warranted."
"['Immunology and Allergy', 'Immunology']","First episode of preschool wheeze requiring hospitalization:a prospective study on the chance of recurrence and associated factors BACKGROUND: Although wheezing is very common in preschoolers, epidemiologic studies in Thailand are quite limited. The likelihood of having a second wheezing episode following the first attack remains unclearly established. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the incidence of recurrent wheezing in preschool children presenting with first wheezing episode and identify the associated factors. METHODS: The study is an observational prospective study conducted at the inpatient pediatric department. Patients admitted with first episode of wheezing were followed up as an outpatient approximately one week after hospital discharge and subsequently followed up by telephone 3-monthly with a structured questionnaire seeking information concerning recurrent wheezing, defined as having a second wheezing episode requiring bronchodilator within a 1-year period. RESULTS: The total of 97 patients, aged 6 months to 5 years, were recruited from June 2014 to November 2015. Thirty-five patients were excluded because of inaccessibility for telephone follow-up. Amongst the remaining 62 patients, twenty-eight (45.2%) had recurrent wheezing within one year. The mean lapse duration was 4.7 ± 3.7 months after the first episode. Having an allergic sensitization to aeroallergen was a risk factor for recurrent wheezing (OR 2.48, 95%CI 1.81-3.4). Although not statistically significant, having an allergic sensitization to food seems to be another related factor (OR 2.36, 95%CI 1.75-3.18). CONCLUSION: The recurrent rate of wheezing was 45%, which was considerably significant. Allergic sensitization to aeroallergen might increase the risk. These patients should be followed up, especially within the first year after their first wheezing episode."
['Dentistry (all)'],"Differential dendritic cell responses to cell wall mannan of Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida dubliniensis  2018, Nihon University, School of Dentistry. All rights reserved.Mannan (mannosylated glycoproteins) in the outermost layer of the Candida cell wall may be the first molecules that interact with host dendritic cells (DCs) and activate immune responses that determine disease outcomes. However, little is known about how different mannan structures of common oral Candida species affect DC activation. The effects of heat-inactivated (HI) yeast cells and soluble mannan of Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida dubliniensis on bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) responses were compared. HI Candida and the mannan exhibited different effects on BMDC activation and functions, which could be due to other carbohydrate compositions in the yeast cell wall. Among Candida mannan, the C. albicans mannan was the weakest stimulus and induced only interferon (IFN)-γ production. This suggests the possibility that C. albicans mannan may skew T helper (Th) responses from protective Th17 toward Th1. In contrast, C. parapsilosis mannan caused strong BMDC activation and high production of several proinflammatory cytokines which possibly promote hyperinflammation. Meanwhile, C. dubliniensis mannan induced moderate BMDC responses, which may correlate with its lower pathogenicity. Therefore, mannan of each Candida species play distinct roles in DC responses and may be involved in the immunopathogenesis and disease severity of oral candidiasis as well as other Candida infection."
"['Nephrology', 'Urology']","Common viral infections in kidney transplant recipients  2018 by The Korean Society of Nephrology.Infectious complications have been considered as a major cause of morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation, especially in the Asian population. Therefore, prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment of such infections are crucial in kidney transplant recipients. Among all infectious complications, viruses are considered to be the most common agents because of their abundance, infectivity, and latency ability. Herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, BK polyomavirus, and adenovirus are well-known etiologic agents of viral infections in kidney transplant patients worldwide because of their wide range of distribution. As DNA viruses, they are able to reactivate after affected patients receive immunosuppressive agents. These DNA viruses can cause systemic diseases or allograft dysfunction, especially in the first six months after transplantation. Pretransplant evaluation and immunization as well as appropriate prophylaxis and preemptive approaches after transplant have been established in the guidelines and are used effectively to reduce the incidence of these viral infections. This review will describe the etiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral infections that commonly affect kidney transplant recipients."

['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"A nonrelativistic limit for AdS perturbations  2018, The Author(s).The familiar c → ∞ nonrelativistic limit converts the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime to the free Schrödinger equation, and the Einstein-massive-scalar system without a cosmological constant to the Schrödinger-Newton (SN) equation. In this paper, motivated by the problem of stability of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, we examine how this limit is affected by the presence of a negative cosmological constant Λ. Assuming for consistency that the product Λc2 tends to a negative constant as c → ∞, we show that the corresponding nonrelativistic limit is given by the SN system with an external harmonic potential which we call the Schrödinger-Newton-Hooke (SNH) system. We then derive the resonant approximation which captures the dynamics of small amplitude spherically symmetric solutions of the SNH system. This resonant system turns out to be much simpler than its general-relativistic version, which makes it amenable to analytic methods. Specifically, in four spatial dimensions, we show that the resonant system possesses a three-dimensional invariant subspace on which the dynamics is completely integrable and hence can be solved exactly. The evolution of the two-lowest-mode initial data (an extensively studied case for the original general-relativistic system), in particular, is described by this family of solutions."

Although many compounds isolated from natural products have been used to treat it, drug resistance is a serious problem, and alternative anti-cancer drugs are required. Here, melittin from Apis mellifera venom was used, and its effects on bronchogenic carcinoma cell proliferation and tumour-associated macrophage differentiation were evaluated. Methods: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of melittin was measured by MTT. Cell death was observed by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) co-staining followed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle arrest was revealed by PI staining and flow cytometry. To investigate the tumour microenvironment, differentiation of circulating monocytes (THP-1) into tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) was assayed by sandwich-ELISA and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were determined. Cell proliferation and migration was observed by flat plate colony formation. Secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by ELISA. The change in expression levels of CatS, Bcl-2, and MADD was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Melittin was significantly more cytotoxic (p < 0.01) to human bronchogenic carcinoma cells (ChaGo-K1) than to the control human lung fibroblasts (Wi-38) cells. At 2.5 μM, melittin caused ChaGo-K1 cells to undergo apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The IL-10 levels showed that melittin significantly inhibited the differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs (p < 0.05) and reduced the number of colonies formed in the treated ChaGo-K1 cells compared to the untreated cells. However, melittin did not affect angiogenesis in ChaGo-K1 cells. Unlike MADD, Bcl-2 was up-regulated significantly (p < 0.05) in melittin-treated ChaGo-K1 cells. Conclusion: Melittin can be used as an alternative agent for lung cancer treatment because of its cytotoxicity against ChaGo-K1 cells and the inhibition of differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Despite tacrolimus (TAC) drug-level monitoring, TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis remains an important problem. This study investigated the potential of urinary neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (uNGAL) as a chronic renal allograft fibrosis biomarker in a two-phase study (proof of concept and cohort). In the proof of concept stage of the study, increased TAC-doses at 3 days after dose adjustment compared with the baseline were associated with elevated uNGAL (+ΔuNGAL) and urinary interleukin 18 (IL-18), but normal serum creatinine (SCr), despite the therapeutic trough levels of TAC. In the cohort study, the patients with elevated uNGAL post-recruitment in comparison with the baseline (+ΔuNGAL) was associated with the more severe renal allograft fibrosis from renal pathology of the protocol biopsy at 12 months post kidney transplantation (post-KT). A cut-off value of uNGAL 125.2 ng/mL during a 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-KT was associated with a higher fibrosis score, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.88, p < 0.0001) and a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.54 (95% CI 1.45 to 9.33; p < 0.001). We conclude that uNGAL is a sensitive biomarker of TAC induced subtle renal injury and TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis. We propose that uNGAL measurements, in addition to trough levels of TAC, should be used to predict TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis in the recipients of KT."

All rights reserved.Background: Sepsis is a common condition affecting the lives of infants and children worldwide. Although implementation of the surviving sepsis campaign (SSC) care bundles was once believed to be effective in reducing sepsis mortality rates, the approach has recently been questioned. Methods: The study was a prospective, interventional, multicenter trial. Infants and children aged 1 month to 15 years in seven different large academic centers in Thailand who had been diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. They were given treatment based on the SSC care bundles. Results: A total of 519 children with severe sepsis or septic shock were enrolled in the study. Among these, 188 were assigned to the intervention group and 331 were recruited to the historical case-control group. There were no significant differences in the baseline clinical characteristics. The intervention group was administered a significantly higher fluid bolus than was the control group (28.3 ± 17.2 cc/kg vs. 17.7 ± 10.6 cc/kg; P = 0.02) with early vasopressor used (1.5 ± 0.7 h) compared to control group (7.4 ± 2.4 h, P < 0.05). More importantly, our sepsis mortality reduced significantly from 37% ± 20.7% during the preintervention period to 19.4% ± 14.3% during the postintervention period (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated a significant reduction in sepsis mortality after the implementation of the SSC care bundles. Early diagnosis of the disease, optimum hemodynamic resuscitation, and timely antibiotic administration are the key elements of sepsis management."

Methods In this multicenter, prospective, observational cohort, females (aged 18 years) with histologically and immunohistochemically confirmed TNBC were enrolled. Patient data was collected at four study visits–an inclusion visit (for enrollment), and three subsequent follow-up visits at 12±1, 24±1, and 36±1 months after completion of first day of any planned chemotherapy. Results Of the 293 enrolled patients, 262 (89.4%) had early-stage TNBC (Stage I: 46 patients, Stage II: 151 patients, and Stage III: 65 patients) and 31 (10.6%) had metastatic TNBC (mTNBC). Chemotherapy was prescribed to 95.4% of the early-stage patients and to 100.0% of the mTNBC patients; most commonly as anthracycline-based in combination with cyclophosphamide and other agents. Patients’ performance status and consensus guidelines were the major factors affecting choice of treatment. In early-stage patients, median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) had not been reached for Stage I and II patients, and were calculated to be 37.0 months and 40.0 months, respectively, in Stage III patients. In mTNBC patients, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were found to be 10.0 months and 14.0 months, respectively. In Stage III patients, anthracycline-based regimens were found to be associated with increase in DFS (p = 0.0181) and OS (p = 0.0027) compared to non-anthracycline-based regimens. In mTNBC patients, non-taxane-based regimens were associated with an increase in PFS (p = 0.0025). The 3-year survival rates in early-stage and mTNBC patients were 85.0% and 21.0%, respectively. Conclusion Clinical management of TNBC in Thailand follows the general guidelines for treatment of TNBC. However, prognosis and survival outcomes are suboptimal, especially in progressive disease. This study is the first assessment in the existing practices in which the results could pave to way to improve the treatment outcome of TNBC in Thailand."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Neutrophils are phagocytic innate immune cells that play essential roles in host defence, but are also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they contribute to systemic inflammation and joint damage. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur as a consequence of this activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the study of changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Sample preparation and spectral analysis protocols were optimised using neutrophils isolated by Ficoll-Paque, with decreased washing steps and inclusion of a heat-shock step to quench metabolite turnover. Cells were incubated ± PMA for 15 min in HEPES-free media and samples were analysed by NMR using a 700 MHz NMR Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software were used to process spectra and identify metabolites. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and signalling pathway analysis was carried out using Metaboanalyst. Cell number and number of scans (NS) were optimised as >3.6 million cells and 512 NS. 327 spectral bins were defined in the neutrophil spectra, of which 287 (87.7%) were assigned to 110 metabolites that included: amino acids, peptides and analogues; carbohydrates, carbonyls and alcohols; nucleotides, nucleosides and analogues; lipids and lipid-like molecules; benzenoids; and other organic compounds. 43 metabolites changed at least 1.5 fold (increase or decrease) after the addition of PMA for 5 or 15 min. Pathway analysis revealed that PMA affected nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and glycolysis, suggesting a redirection of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway and production of NADPH for activation of the NADPH oxidase and subsequent respiratory burst. We have developed protocols for the study of human neutrophils by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, this methodology has sufficient sensitivity and reproducibility to detect changes in metabolite abundance from cell numbers typically collected from clinical samples or experiments with multiple assay conditions."
"['Hepatology', 'Gastroenterology']","Role of mucoprotective agents in endoscopic submucosal dissection-derived ulcers: A systematic review  2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Background: Currently, it is still unclear whether adding a mucoprotective agent to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) results in better outcomes compared with using a PPI alone in patients with post-gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) ulcers. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of PPI alone versus combination treatment in healing of post-gastric ESD ulcers, as well as on delayed bleeding and amount of blood transfused. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ISI Web of knowledge databases, up until May 2017, for randomized trials comparing PPI alone versus PPI plus a mucoprotective drug in achieving ulcer healing in patients undergoing gastric ESD was performed. The primary outcome is scarring stage on endoscopic assessment at 4 or 8 weeks after gastric ESD. Results: From an initial 3071 citations, eight articles (n = 953 lesions from 934 patients) were analyzed. Patients receiving combination treatment achieved a scarring stage significantly more often than those on a PPIs alone at 4 or 8 weeks after ESD, (risk ratio = 1.36, 95% CI; 1.06–1.75). No study reported amount of blood transfused. There were no significant between treatment-group differences in terms of delayed bleeding (risk ratio = 0.58, 95% CI; 0.17–1.99). Neither location of ulcer nor Helicobacter pylori infection was related to ulcer scarring stage. Conclusion: The limited evidences suggested combination treatment may be more effective in accelerating the process of ulcer healing in patients undergoing gastric ESD than the use of PPI alone, but does not appear to alter delayed bleeding risk."

We present a 69 arcmin 2 ALMA survey at 1.1 mm, GOODS-ALMA, matching the deepest HST-WFC3 H-band part of the GOODS-South field. Methods. We tapered the 0″24 original image with a homogeneous and circular synthesized beam of 0″60 to reduce the number of independent beams - thus reducing the number of purely statistical spurious detections - and optimize the sensitivity to point sources. We extracted a catalog of galaxies purely selected by ALMA and identified sources with and without HST counterparts down to a 5σ limiting depth of H=28.2 AB (HST/WFC3 F160W). Results. ALMA detects 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy at 1.1 mm in the 0″60 tapered mosaic (rms sensitivity σ ≃ 0.18 mJy beam -1 ) with a purity greater than 80%. Among these detections, we identify three sources with no HST nor Spitzer-IRAC counterpart, consistent with the expected number of spurious galaxies from the analysis of the inverted image; their definitive status will require additional investigation. We detect additional three sources with HST counterparts either at high significance in the higher resolution map, or with different detection-algorithm parameters ensuring a purity greater than 80%. Hence we identify in total 20 robust detections. Conclusions. Our wide contiguous survey allows us to push further in redshift the blind detection of massive galaxies with ALMA with a median redshift of z=2.92 and a median stellar mass of M ∗ =1.1 × 10 11 M ⊙ . Our sample includes 20% HST-dark galaxies (4 out of 20), all detected in the mid-infrared with Spitzer-IRAC. The near-infrared based photometric redshifts of two of them (z∼4.3 and 4.8) suggest that these sources have redshifts z> 4. At least 40% of the ALMA sources host an X-ray AGN, compared to ∼14% for other galaxies of similar mass and redshift. The wide area of our ALMA survey provides lower values at the bright end of number counts than single-dish telescopes affected by confusion."

Moreover, the introduction of multiple subgenotypes and the emergence of recombinant viruses is of epidemiological importance. Based on either the full genome or VP1 sequences, 32 enteroviruses (30 from HFMD patients, 1 from an encephalitic patient, and 1 from an asymptomatic contact case) isolated in Thailand between 2006 and 2014 were identified as 25 enterovirus 71 (EV71) isolates (comprising 20 B5, 1 C2, 2 C4a, and 2 C4b subgenotypes) and 7 coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) isolates (comprising 6 B1a and 1 B1b subgenotypes). The EV71 subgenotype C4b was introduced into Thailand for the first time in 2006 and was replaced by subgenotype C4a strains in 2009. Phylogenetic, similarity plot and bootscan analyses of the complete viral genomes identified 12 recombinant viruses among the 32 viral isolates. Only one EV71-B5 isolate out of 20 was a recombinant virus with one region of intratypic or intertypic recombination, while all four EV71-C4 isolates were recombinant viruses having undergone double recombination, and all seven CA16 isolates were recombinant viruses. The recombination breakpoints of these recombinants are located solely within the P2 and P3 regions. Surveillance for circulating strains and subgenotype replacement are important with respect to molecular epidemiology and the selection of the upcoming EV71 vaccine. In addition, the clinical importance of recombinant viruses needs to be further explored."
"['Genetics', 'Genetics (clinical)']","Two-state co-expression network analysis to identify genes related to salt tolerance in Thai rice  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML105) rice is one of the most important crops of Thailand. It is a challenging task to identify the genes responding to salinity in KDML105 rice. The analysis of the gene co-expression network has been widely performed to prioritize significant genes, in order to select the key genes in a specific condition. In this work, we analyzed the two-state co-expression networks of KDML105 rice under salt-stress and normal grown conditions. The clustering coefficient was applied to both networks and exhibited significantly different structures between the salt-stress state network and the original (normal-grown) network. With higher clustering coefficients, the genes that responded to the salt stress formed a dense cluster. To prioritize and select the genes responding to the salinity, we investigated genes with small partners under normal conditions that were highly expressed and were co-working with many more partners under salt-stress conditions. The results showed that the genes responding to the abiotic stimulus and relating to the generation of the precursor metabolites and energy were the great candidates, as salt tolerant marker genes. In conclusion, in the case of the complexity of the environmental conditions, gaining more information in order to deal with the co-expression network provides better candidates for further analysis."
"['Astronomy and Astrophysics', 'Space and Planetary Science']","The [CII] emission as a molecular gas mass tracer in galaxies at low and high redshifts  2018 The Author(s).We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the [CII]158 μm emission for a sample of 10 mainsequence galaxies at redshift z ~ 2, with typical stellar masses (logM*/M⊙ ~ 10.0-10.9) and star formation rates (~35-115 M⊙ yr-1). Given the strong and well-understood evolution of the interstellar medium from the present to z = 2, we investigate the behaviour of the [CII] emission and empirically identify its primary driver. We detect [C II] from six galaxies (four secure and two tentative) and estimate ensemble averages including non-detections. The [C II]- to-infrared luminosity ratio (L[C II]/LIR) of our sample is similar to that of local main-sequence galaxies (~2 × 10-3), and ~10 times higher than that of starbursts. The [CII] emission has an average spatial extent of 4-7 kpc, consistent with the optical size. Complementing our sample with literature data, we find that the [CII] luminosity correlates with galaxies' molecular gas mass, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.2 dex and without evident systematics: the [CII]- to-H2 conversion factor (α[C II] ~ 30 M⊙/L⊙) is largely independent of galaxies' depletion time, metallicity, and redshift. [C II] seems therefore a convenient tracer to estimate galaxies' molecular gas content regardless of their starburst or main-sequence nature, and extending to metal-poor galaxies at low and high redshifts. The dearth of [C II] emission reported for z > 6-7 galaxies might suggest either a high star formation efficiency or a small fraction of ultraviolet light from star formation reprocessed by dust."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Rice nucleolin (OsNUC1), consisting of two isoforms, OsNUC1-L and OsNUC1-S, is a multifunctional protein involved in salt-stress tolerance. Here, OsNUC1-S’s function was investigated using transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsNUC1-S. Under non-stress conditions, the transgenic lines showed a lower yield, but higher net photosynthesis rates, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates than wild type only in the second leaves, while in the flag leaves, these parameters were similar among the lines. However, under salt-stress conditions at the booting stage, the higher yields in transgenic lines were detected. Moreover, the gas exchange parameters of the transgenic lines were higher in both flag and second leaves, suggesting a role for OsNUC1-S overexpression in photosynthesis adaptation under salt-stress conditions. Moreover, the overexpression lines could maintain light-saturation points under salt-stress conditions, while a decrease in the light-saturation point owing to salt stress was found in wild type. Based on a transcriptome comparison between wild type and a transgenic line, after 3 and 9 days of salt stress, the significantly differentially expressed genes were enriched in the metabolic process of nucleic acid and macromolecule, photosynthesis, water transport, and cellular homeostasis processes, leading to the better performance of photosynthetic processes under salt-stress conditions at the booting stage."

Yet, reporting is often inferior, as shown by this example of local governments in New Zealand. Poor quality reporting has led to different initiatives to improve service performance reporting quality, and this study investigates the effectiveness of three initiatives undertaken by the Auditor-General. Drawing on contemporary institutional and legitimacy theories, we find that normative pressure in tandem with threats to legitimacy is influential in improving service performance reporting. However, despite mimetic examples also being used, the analysis shows it is an ineffective tool in the New Zealand local government context."
['Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)'],"Genetic diversity and relationships among Lyle's flying fox colonies in Thailand  2018 Kasetsart UniversityLyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei) is a large frugivorous bat found in central Thailand that usually roosts in temples in the middle of towns in close proximity to humans. Pteropus lylei is considered a reservoir for Nipah encephalitis viral outbreaks reported in Malaysia and Bangladesh. Thailand is bordered to the south by Malaysia. Information on the genetic diversity and genetic relationships of P. lylei is limited; therefore, cytochrome b (cytb) DNA sequences were used to examine the genetic diversity and genetic relationships of P. lylei. In total, 52 P. lylei individuals from 10 colonies in central Thailand were analyzed. The study identified 25 unique haplotypes and 43 variable sites among the 52 individuals. The results showed that P. lylei had high levels of haplotype diversity (0.949, 25 different haplotypes among 52 individuals) but low levels of nucleotide diversity (0.006). The overall pairwise φST was 0.006 (p < 0.05). The results indicated that high levels of gene flow occurred among P. lylei colonies distributed across central Thailand. The sequence data suggested that the overall P. lylei population has high levels of haplotype diversity, which may reflect genetic exchange during P. lylei movement. These results will help manage populations and assess the risk of outbreaks of the encephalitis (Nipah) virus carried by Lyle's flying fox."

The Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is among the best-known methods to have achieved remarkably accurate segmentation. Nevertheless, current advancements appear to have left the problem of compound words unaccounted for. Compound words lose their meaning or context once segmented. Hence, we introduce a dictionary-based word-merging algorithm, which merges all kinds of compound words. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm can accomplish a high-accuracy of word segmentation, with compound words being preserved. Moreover, it can also restore some incorrectly segmented words. Another problem involving a different word-chunking approach is sentence boundary ambiguity. In tackling the problem, utilizing the part of speech (POS) of a segmented word has been found previously to help boost the accuracy of CRF-based sentence segmentation. However, not all segmented words can be tagged. Thus, we propose a POS-based word-splitting algorithm, which splits words in order to increase POS tags. We found that with more identifiable POS tags, the CRF model performs better in segmenting sentences. To demonstrate the contributions of both methods, we experimented with three of their applications. With the word merging algorithm, we found that intact compound words in the product of topic extraction can help to preserve their intended meanings, offering more precise information for human interpretation. The algorithm, together with the POS-based word-splitting algorithm, can also be used to amend word-level Thai-English translations. In addition, the word-splitting algorithm improves sentence segmentation, thus enhancing text summarization."
['Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine'],"Baseline atrial fibrillation is associated with contrast-induced nephropathy after cardiac catheterization in coronary artery disease: Systemic review and meta-analysis  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, independently associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Recent studies suggest that AF is potentially associated with contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing catheterization. However, the association was not conclusive. Thus, we assessed the association between AF in patients with CAD and CIN by a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. Hypothesis: AF is a predictor of CIN in patients with CAD. Methods: We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to April 2018. Included studies were published observational studies that compared the risk of CIN among CAD patients with AF vs those without AF. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Eight cohort studies from June 2007 to November 2017 were included in this meta-analysis involving 16,691 subjects with CAD (1,030 with AF and 15,661 without its presence). The presence of AF was associated with CIN (pooled risk ratio = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.50-3.14, P < 0.001, I 2 = 54.1%). In our subgroup analysis by urgency and multivariable adjustment, both groups still showed substantial association between AF and CIN (P < 0.05). Conclusions: AF increased the risk of CIN up to two fold among patients with CAD compared to the absence of it. Our study suggests that the presence of AF in CAD is prognostic for the development of CIN."

Word tokenization and stop words list are the conventional method for keyword extraction task, however for Thai language in social media platform, there are still no efficient word tokenization tools and stop words list to extract trend from platform such as Facebook. Therefore, in this research, we propose an algorithm that require no word tokenization tools and external stop words list for the purpose of Trend Keywords extraction. The core idea is using Character n-Grams, instead of Word n-Grams, to tokenize, process, and combine n-Grams into keyword. After that we identified Trend Keywords from other keywords by using our algorithm to generate stop words list for filtering out stop words. For the evaluation of result, we use human to classify the retrieved Trend Keywords and compare them with Trend Keywords from baseline method. As a result, our algorithm can identify more keyword than baseline method. Finally, the precision of generated stop words list is 97.6%, and the precision of Trend Keywords is 40% with the used of 1-month generated stop words list. Furthermore, by using 2-months generated stop words list, the precision can be increased to 44% by consuming more processing time for list of stop words."

All Rights Reserved.It is generally believed that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm matrix itself acts as a molecular sieve or sink that contributes to significant levels of drug resistance, but it is becoming more apparent that multidrug efflux pumps induced during biofilm growth significantly enhance resistance levels. We present here a novel transcriptional regulator, PA3898, which controls biofilm formation and multidrug efflux pumps in P. aeruginosa. A mutant of this regulator significantly reduced the ability of P. aeruginosa to produce biofilm in vitro and affected its in vivo fitness and pathogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and BALB/c mouse lung infection models. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PA3898 modulates essential virulence genes/pathways, including multidrug efflux pumps and phenazine biosynthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified its DNA binding sequences and confirmed that PA3898 directly interacts with promoter regions of four genes/operons, two of which are mexAB-oprM and phz2. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed a regulatory partner of PA3898 as PA2100, and both are required for binding to DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. PA3898 and PA2100 were given the names MdrR1 and MdrR2, respectively, as novel repressors of the mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux operon and activators for another multidrug efflux pump, EmrAB. The interaction between MdrR1 and MdrR2 at the promoter regions of their regulons was further characterized via localized surface plasmon resonance and DNA footprinting. These regulators directly repress the mexAB-oprM operon, independent of its well-established MexR regulator. Mutants of mdrR1 and mdrR2 caused increased resistance to multiple antibiotics in P. aeruginosa, validating the significance of these newly discovered regulators."

This is lacking in the Asia-Pacific region. Design: The observational Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS) II was established to quantify the extent of hyperlipidemia in adults with acute and stable coronary heart disease globally. Methods: Patients with stable coronary heart disease or hospitalised with an acute coronary syndrome were enrolled across nine Asia-Pacific countries from July 2013 to October 2014. Lipid-lowering therapy and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment (<70 mg/dL) were assessed. The acute coronary syndrome cohort was followed up 4 months post-discharge. Results: Of the 4592 patients enrolled, 2794 had stable coronary heart disease and 1798 were admitted with an acute coronary syndrome. In the coronary heart disease cohort, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 86.9 mg/dL, with 91.7% using lipid-lowering therapy and 31% achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL. In the acute coronary syndrome cohort at admission, the corresponding values were 103.2 mg/dL, 63.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Target attainment was significantly higher in lipid-lowering therapy-treated than non-treated patients in each cohort (32.6% vs. 12.9% and 31.1% vs. 9.0%, respectively). Mean atorvastatin-equivalent dosages were low (20 ± 15 and 22 ± 18 mg/day, respectively), with little use of non-statin adjuvants (13.0% and 6.8%, respectively). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment had improved by follow-up for the acute coronary syndrome patients, but remained low (41.7%). Conclusions: Many patients in Asia at very high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level above the recommended target. Although lipid-lowering therapy was common, it was not used to its full potential."

C. krusei prevalence in candidiasis worldwide has increased since this pathogen has developed multidrug resistance. However, little is known how the immune system responds to C. krusei. Particularly, the molecular mechanisms of the interplay between C. krusei mannan and DCs remain to be elucidated. We investigated how C. krusei mannan affected DC responses in comparison to C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata mannan. Our results showed that only C. krusei mannan induced massive cytokine responses in DCs, and led to apoptosis. Although C. krusei mannan-activated DCs underwent apoptosis, they were still capable of initiating Th17 response. C. krusei mannan-mediated DC apoptosis was obligated to the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway. These pathways also controlled Th1/Th17 switching possibly by virtue of the production of the polarizing cytokines IL-12 and IL-6 by the C. krusei mannan activated-DCs. Our study suggests that TLR2 and MyD88 pathway in DCs are dominant for C. krusei mannan recognition, which differs from the previous reports showing a crucial role of C-type lectin receptors in Candida mannan sensing."

However, the causation between abnormal patterns of orofacial muscle function and dental malocclusion remains unclear. To clarify the pathogenic mechanism of malocclusion, it is important to determine the relative positional relationship between the tongue tip and incisor edge or the dorsal tongue and palate during deglutition. Here, we assessed the utility of 3-T segmented cine-magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, combined with static MR images for hard tissue visualization, in assessing the relationship between the tongue and the surrounding tissues during deglutitive tongue movement. Methods: Cine-MR images were acquired from three healthy female volunteers during deglutition who had no history of swallowing disorder or other chronic illness, normal alignment and occlusion, and a skeletal class I relationship. Three cine-MR images were taken during deglutition in accordance with an auditory cue for each volunteer. During static imaging, custom-made, contrast-medium-filled clear retainers were positioned in the mouth to allow visualization of the upper and lower incisors and hard palate boundaries. Static images were superimposed onto images of the three stages in deglutitive tongue movement, which were selected from a series of cine-MR images. These superimpositions were assessed five times by tracing cephalometric parameters to examine the reproducibility of the method. Results: Traces varied little across repeated measurements, and all subjects had a similar pattern of dorsal tongue movement. Tongue-to-palate contact increased slightly during the first to second stage of swallowing and abruptly increased during the second to third stage, while the tongue tip position remained constant. Conclusions: Segmented cine-MR imaging combined with static MR images is useful for assessing soft tissue motion during deglutition. This method is particularly useful in dentistry to evaluate the relationship between tongue function and maxillofacial morphology in terms of orthodontic treatment and orofacial myofunctional therapy, and for improving tongue movement during speech therapy."

This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a brief human immunodeficiency virus (B-HIV) prevention program on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) knowledge, perceived benefits of condom use, risk reduction self-efficacy, risk reduction behaviors, and reinfection rate among Thai men with STIs. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was conducted. Participants were selected from men with STI symptoms. They were randomly assigned to a B-HIV prevention program or usual care, 100 each. The program consisted of 3 modules. Key messages for HIV prevention were sent weekly through Line. Outcomes were HIV and STI knowledge, perceived benefits of condom use, risk reduction self-efficacy, risk reduction behaviors (condom use, the number of sexual partners, and condomless sex), and STI reinfection rate. Independent t-test and binary logistic regression were performed. Results: The B-HIV prevention program significantly increased HIV and STI knowledge and resulted in perception of greater benefits from condoms and greater risk reduction self-efficacy. Program participants used condoms more frequently with many types of partners, especially with casual partners and sex workers. The intervention group practiced condomless sex less frequently than the control group. The program did not improve participants’ condom use with lovers/steady partners and did not decrease the number of sexual partners and STI reinfection rate at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: A B-HIV prevention program could reduce the risk of HIV infection among male clients with current STIs by enhancing their condom use with casual partners and sex workers. Strategies to improve condom use with lovers/steady partners among this high-risk population is needed."

All rights reserved.The present research focuses on elucidating of the impact of Lewis acids including AlCl3 and FeCl2 addition on catalytic behaviors during ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization over the TiCl4/MgCl2/THF catalyst (Cat. A). In this study, the Cat. A with the absence and presence of Lewis acids was synthesized via the chemical route. Then, all catalyst samples were characterized and tested in the slurry polymerization. For ethylene polymerization, using the Cat. A with the presence of AlCl3 apparently gave the highest activity among other catalysts. In addition, the activity of catalysts tended to increase with the presence of the Lewis acids. This can be attributed to an enhancement of active center distribution by the addition of Lewis acids leading to larger amounts of the isolated Ti species. Moreover, with the presence of Lewis acids, the effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity was also less pronounced. Considering ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, it revealed that the catalyst with the presence of mixed Lewis acids (AlCl3 + FeCl2) exhibited the highest activity. It is suggested that the presence of mixed Lewis acids possibly caused a change in acidity of active sites, which is suitable for copolymerization. However, activities of all catalysts in ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization were lower than those in ethylene polymerization. The effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity for both polymerization and copolymerization system was found to be similar with the presence of Lewis acids. Based on this study, it is quite promising to enhance the catalytic activity by addition of proper Lewis acids, especially when the pressure of hydrogen increases. The characteristics of polymers obtained upon the presence of Lewis acids will be discussed further in more detail."

Vonoprazan is a newer agent that has been shown to be more potent than a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). However, it remains unclear whether vonoprazan is more effective than PPI in promoting healing of ulcers caused by ESD. Medline and Embase databases were searched through January 2018 for studies that compared the rate of complete healing of ulcers caused by ESD and post-ESD delayed bleeding in patients who received vonoprazan versus those who received PPI after ESD. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q-statistic and I 2. A total of six studies consisting of 461 patients were identified. The likelihood that ulcers caused by ESD were completely healed at 4-8 weeks after the procedure was significantly higher among patients who received vonoprazan compared with those who received PPI, with a pooled OR of 2.27 (95% CI=1.38-3.73; I 2 =0%). The risk of developing post-ESD delayed bleeding was also numerically lower among those who received vonoprazan, with a pooled OR of 0.79, although the result did not reach statistical significance (95% CI=0.18-3.49; I 2 =29%).

Recently, an animal model based on chronic LPS administration was developed which was associated with long-lasting depressive-like and neuro-oxidative alterations in female mice. The aim of the current study was to investigate behavioral, neuroimmune and neuroprogressive alterations in female mice 6 weeks after LPS chronic exposure. Female mice received increasing doses of LPS during 5 days at one-month intervals repeated for 4 consecutive months. Six weeks after the last LPS-exposure, we assessed behavioral despair and anhedonia, microglial activation, alterations in tryptophan, 5-HT, kynurenine, quinolinic acid (QUIN) levels and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1) expression in the hippocampus, both with and without fluoxetine administration. Our results show that six weeks post-LPS, mice present behavioral despair and anhedonia in association with increased IBA1 expression (a microglia activation marker), NF-kB p65 and IL-1β levels, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) mRNA expression, kynurenine, QUIN levels and QUIN/tryptophan ratio, and lowered tryptophan, 5-HT levels and SAT1 mRNA expression. Fluoxetine reversed the behavioral and neuroimmune alterations but had no effect in the reversal of IDO1 increased expression, QUIN levels and QUIN/tryptophan ratio. In conclusion, our results support the validity of the chronic LPS model of major depression and additionally shows its translational relevance with respect to neuroimmune and neuroprogressive pathways."

Metal contamination in seafood has raised public health concerns, especially for local residents who live in coastal areas. In this study, the levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and zinc (Zn) were determined in the marine bivalve, Marcia optima, as well as in water, and sediment samples collected from the coastal area of Phuket Bay, Thailand. The results showed that metal concentrations in sediments (4.05–7.14, 16.68–18.13, 164–213 mg kg −1 for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively) and water samples (0.16–0.44, 0.15–0.26, and 0.32–0.48 mg L −1 for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively) were below the threshold effects concentration of the sediment quality guidelines for adverse effects to occur and the marine water quality standards of Thailand. A human risk assessment was performed and the results showed that the risks associated with M. optima consumption at Saphan Hin and Paklok were negligible for most of the metals studied, with the maximum estimated daily intake value being observed for Zn (0.00663 mg kg −1 per day) at Saphan Hin. In addition, Cd, Zn, Pb, and Hg would be unlikely to pose a risk to human health with a hazard quotient of less than 1, with only the bioaccumulation factor of Zn being detectable in both locations (0.034 and 0.026 at Saphan Hin and Paklok, respectively). However, continuous monitoring is encouraged to prevent the risks associated with the consumption of metal-contaminated seafood."
"['Biotechnology', 'Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology']","Incorporation of 13 C-HCO 3 − by ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria during ammonia oxidation of sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) have recently been proposed as potential players for ammonia removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, there is little evidence directly showing the contribution of AOA to ammonia oxidation in these engineered systems. In this study, DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) with labeled 13 C-HCO 3 − was introduced to sludge from a municipal WWTP. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that AOA amoA genes outnumbered AOB amoA genes in this WWTP sludge. AOA amoA gene sequence analysis revealed that AOA present in this WWTP were specific to one subcluster within the group 1.1b Thaumarchaeota. When ammonia was supplied to DNA-SIP incubation, the DNA-SIP profiles demonstrated the incorporation of the 13 C into AOA and AOB. However, the 13 C was not found to be assimilated into both microorganisms in the incubation without ammonia. Specific primers were designed to target amoA genes of AOA belonging to the subcluster found in this WWTP. Applying the primers to DNA-SIP experiment revealed that AOA of this subcluter most likely utilized inorganic carbon during ammonia oxidation under the studied conditions."

Investigating ecophysiological responses of different tree species to seasonal conditions and drought will help determine which would succeed in urban conditions. Here, we examined water use characteristics of common species in Bangkok, Thailand: Pterocarpus indicus (Pi), Swietenia macrophylla (Sm) and Lagerstroemia speciosa (Ls), with different phenology, under seasonal variations and soil drying. Thirty small trees were potted and irrigated to ≥80% of the field capacity (θFC) of the soil. Granier-type sensors were used to measure sap flux density from 23 August to 18 December 2017. Drought treatments were imposed on five trees of each species by withholding irrigation until θ reached ∼50% θFC. Results suggested that water use patterns of semi-evergreen and evergreen species (Pi and Sm) were not sensitive to either seasonal or soil moisture variations while deciduous species (Ls) exhibited decreased water use and earlier stomatal closure upon soil drying in the dry season. These findings suggested that water use characteristics of the evergreen species may conserve water use regardless of atmospheric and soil moisture conditions while those of the deciduous species may result in high cost for irrigation in the wet season. Nevertheless, we believe that both evergreen and deciduous species may be selected for planting to maximize greening areas in cities throughout the year. However, knowledge of different water use characteristics of street tree species should be applied to devise strategic planning for optimized irrigation in urban greening."
"['Nephrology', 'Urology']","The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers combined with calcium channel blockers on metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients: a meta-analysis  2018, Springer Nature B.V.Background: The prevalence of hypertension and its associated complications are markedly growing. Most patients need more than one drug to achieve blood pressure (BP) target. However, most guidelines only focus on the first-line treatment. We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combined with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials.gov (until April 7, 2016) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the benefits of ACEIs/ARBs combined with CCBs versus other dual or triple combinations on clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients. Random effects models were used to compute the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables. Results: Sixty RCTs (48,913 patients) were identified. When compared with other combinations, the combination of ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs had comparable WMD of systolic as well as diastolic BP (73 study arms) but provided better benefits on metabolic parameters, such as HDL, FBS, HbA1C, and serum uric acid; renal functions, including serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate; and cardiovascular diseases, including reduction of all cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, and syncope/hypotension. A significant increase of serum potassium was observed. Conclusion: The combination of ACEIs/ARBs with CCBs has superior benefits on metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients. Therefore, this combination should be considered whenever monotherapy does not achieve the guideline target."
"['Pathology and Forensic Medicine', 'Cell Biology']","Comparison between digital image analysis and visual assessment of immunohistochemical HER2 expression in breast cancer  2018 Elsevier GmbHBackground: Assessment of HER2 status is considered standard of care in the histopathologic workup of breast cancer and conveys prognostic and predictive information used to guide treatment decisions. The assessment is often carried out in a two-step approach where immunohistochemical expression of HER2 protein is first evaluated by conventional microscopy and equivocal cases are further analyzed by in-situ hybridization techniques to assess gene amplification status. In this study we compared conventional manual assessment of immunohistochemical HER2 expression with digital image analysis (DIA) and consensus manual assessment by a panel of three pathologists. Methods: From our archive we retrieved sections of 109 invasive breast carcinomas stained for HER2 with corresponding HER2 score from the original pathology report. The glass slides were assessed by three pathologists to reach a consensus score. Next, the slides were scanned into whole slide images and DIA was performed using Aperio Imagescope. The scoring results were then compared with gene amplification status evaluated by dual in-situ hybridization (DISH). Results: Comparing manual assessment with consensus assessment and DIA, good agreement was obtained with weighted kappa coefficients of 0.79 (manual vs. consensus) and 0.67 (manual vs. DIA). When compared with gene status assessment by DISH, agreement analysis yielded weighted kappa coefficients of 0.52 (manual vs. DISH), 0.58 (consensus vs. DISH) and 0.78 (DIA vs. DISH). There were no false negatives by any of the three methods and false positives ranging from 0.9 to 2.8%. The proportion of equivocal cases by each method was 44% (manual), 33.3% (consensus) and 14.7% (DIA). Application of DIA reduced the number of equivocal cases by 67% without increasing the proportion of false negatives. Conclusion: We conclude that DIA is an accurate method to reduce the number of HER2 equivocal cases without affecting the sensitivity of the HER2 assessment."

Phytochemicals may be promising anticancer agents given their various chemical structures and diverse biological activities. Damnacanthal (DAM) is a major bioactive component of Noni, which has been investigated previously as a cancer-preventive or chemotherapeutic agent. DAM has also been reported to exhibit anti-proliferative activity in several cancer types. In the present study, it was identified that DAM downregulates chromosome maintenance protein 1 (CRM1) expression in human cancer cells. The application of chitosan-based nanoparticles (NPs) with DAM also induced CRM1 downregulation, which suggests that chitosan-based NPs may be effective vehicles for delivery of phytochemicals such as DAM. It was also identified that DAM increased the levels of the tumor suppressor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-activated gene 1 in the nucleus, thereby leading to enhanced anticancer effects. The results of the present study indicate that DAM and its nanoformulation may be a candidate anticancer drug."

The prevalence of Plasmodium vivax infection has been increasing in the past decades. Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein (PvMSP) gene encodes a malaria vaccine candidate antigen. Its polymorphic nature leads to antigenic variation, the barrier for vaccine development, drug resistance, and potential for multiple-clone infections within the malaria patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of PvMSP1 and PvMSP3 gene in P. vivax populations in Thailand. A total of 100 P. vivax isolates collected from the western (Kanchanaburi and Tak Provinces) and southern (Ranong Provinces) regions along the Thai-Myanmar border were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Analysis of the F1, F2, and F3 regions of PvMSP1 revealed 5, 2, and 3 allelic variants, respectively. Three major types of PvMSP3-α and two major types of PvMSP3-β were identified based on the PCR product sizes. After digestion with restriction enzymes, 29, 25, 26, and 18 patterns were distinguished by RFLP for PvMSP1 (F2, Alu I), PvMSP1 (F2, Mnl I), PvMSP3-α, and PvMSP3-β, respectively. Combination of each family variant (PvMSP1 and PvMSP3) resulted in high genetic polymorphism of P. vivax population. Additionally, using PvMSP1 polymorphic marker revealed a significant association between multiple-genotype infections and P. vivax parasitemia. The results strongly supported that P. vivax populations in the endemic areas along the Thai-Myanmar border are highly diverse."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Detection of host pathways universally inhibited after Plasmodium yoelii infection for immune intervention  2018, The Author(s).Malaria is a disease with diverse symptoms depending on host immune status and pathogenicity of Plasmodium parasites. The continuous parasite growth within a host suggests mechanisms of immune evasion by the parasite and/or immune inhibition in response to infection. To identify pathways commonly inhibited after malaria infection, we infected C57BL/6 mice with four Plasmodium yoelii strains causing different disease phenotypes and 24 progeny of a genetic cross. mRNAs from mouse spleens day 1 and/or day 4 post infection (p.i.) were hybridized to a mouse microarray to identify activated or inhibited pathways, upstream regulators, and host genes playing an important role in malaria infection. Strong interferon responses were observed after infection with the N67 strain, whereas initial inhibition and later activation of hematopoietic pathways were found after infection with 17XNL parasite, showing unique responses to individual parasite strains. Inhibitions of pathways such as Th1 activation, dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and NFAT immune regulation were observed in mice infected with all the parasite strains day 4 p.i., suggesting universally inhibited immune pathways. As a proof of principle, treatment of N67-infected mice with antibodies against T cell receptors OX40 or CD28 to activate the inhibited pathways enhanced host survival. Controlled activation of these pathways may provide important strategies for better disease management and for developing an effective vaccine."

Variations in the shape and attachment point of the PMi could cause discomfort in the shoulders. The aim of this study was to observe the types of morphological insertion patterns and attachment sites of the PMi. Methods: Seventy-four sides of fresh, embalmed Korean (42 sides; mean age 78 years) and Thai (32 sides; mean age 78 years) cadavers were dissected to analyze the morphological insertion types and attachment sites of the PMi. Results: Unusual insertion patterns were evident in about 23% of the samples. When the portion of the PMi tendon ran over the coracoid process, the most common attachment site was the glenohumeral joint capsule. We also confirmed the attachment of the PMi to the clavicle. Costal attachments of the PMi that extend from the second rib to the fourth rib were observed frequently as well. Conclusions: Unusual insertion patterns of the PMi are common. Some authors consider that tendon attachment to the joint capsule can cause shoulder pain. In addition, the PMi tendon could be utilized in acromioclavicular joint reconstruction. Surgeons need to be aware of the possibility of a PMi variant being found during surgery even when this is not visible in magnetic resonance or ultrasound imaging."

The structural similarity of a rectangular cross-section beam with a through-thickness edge crack and elastically supported was investigated. The beam was subjected to concentrated forces perpendicular to its longitudinal axis and concentrated bending moments. Complete similarity conditions and scaling laws for static deflection and slope of the cracked beam were derived using the principle of conservation of energy and the strain energy release rate approach within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Accuracy of the derived complete similarity conditions and scaling laws were experimentally and numerically verified. The concept of incorporating the similarity theory to problems of structural health monitoring was explained.

It had good physical properties, efficacy, and safety. For further use as a medical material, this dressing was investigated for its efficacy and safety in split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor-site wound treatment compared to Bactigras® (control). Moreover, the inflammatory responses to both dressings were also deeply investigated. For in vivo study, expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines were intensely considered in the tissue interfacing area. The result showed that IL-4 and TGF-β from BCSP-treated tissue had advantages over Bactigras®-treated tissue at 14 and 21 days post-implantation. For clinical study, a single-blinded, randomized controlled study was generated. The half of STSG donor site wound was randomly assigned to cover with BCSP or Bactigras®. Twenty-one patients with 32 STSG donor site wounds were enrolled. The results showed that wound-healing time was not significantly different in both dressings. However, wound quality of BCSP was better than Bactigras® at healing time and after 1 month (p < 0.05). The pain scores of BCSP-treated wound were statistically significant lower than Bactigras®-treated wound (p < 0.05). No sign of infection or adverse event was observed after treatment with both dressings. In conclusion, the inflammation responses of the dressing were clearly clarified. The advantages of BCSP were wound-quality improvement, pain reduction, and infection protection without adverse events. It was fit to be used as the alternative treatment of STSG donor site wound."

We examine how types of familial and nonfamilial caregivers are associated with the well-being of older persons. Results: The need for LTC increases sharply with age and is more common among women than men. Spouses and children constitute approximately 90% of main caregivers. The association of a family member as the main caregiver and education or value of assets is quite weak underscoring the general normative prescription for family members to serve as care providers.

The sorption isotherms of Cd2+ on colloids and sand at pH values of 3, 6, and 8 were characterized by batch experiments. Cd2+ sorption by colloids and sand fit well with the Freundlich model. In the column experiments, increasing the pH increased the retardation factors and KF values of Cd2+ both with and without the presence of the colloids. The amount of Cd2+ sorbed onto the montmorillonite KSF colloids in the column effluent increased from 0.29 to 0.97 mg as the pH increased. The colloid increased Cd2+ mobility and acted as a carrier at a high solution pH. The increasing level of Cd2+ sorbed on colloids as the pH increased resulted in a long tailing of the breakthrough curve (BTC) of the total Cd, indicating that the total Cd was controlled by rate-limited reactions. These findings indicate that when the solution pH was greater than the point of zero charge (PZC) of the colloids (pH > 6), the system tended to follow a nonequilibrium two-site (TSM) model rather than an equilibrium (CDeq) model. This implies that the PZC of the colloids in the groundwater system is the main factor in predicting facilitated Cd2+ transport."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Adaptive effect of sericin on hepatic mitochondrial conformation through its regulation of apoptosis, autophagy and energy maintenance: a proteomics approach  2018, The Author(s).We recently demonstrated that in addition to its protective effect on pancreatic and adrenal biosynthesis, antioxidant properties of sericin decrease blood cholesterol levels and improve the liver mitochondrial architecture. However, little is known about the detailed mechanisms underlying these effects. Using proteomics and electron microscopy, we identified mitochondrial proteins that play important roles in the preservation of the mitochondrial ultrastructure and cholesterol-lowering properties of sericin. Our results showed that sericin maintains the mitochondrial architecture during conditions of high blood cholesterol by regulating apoptotic (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit) and autophagic (mitochondrial elongation factor Tu and prohibitin-2) proteins as well as energy maintenance proteins [haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing protein 3, succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein subunit, ATP synthase-α subunit precursor, enoyl-CoA hydratase domain-containing protein 3 and electron transfer flavoprotein subunit-α]. Sericin also exerts anti-oxidative properties via aconitate hydratase and Chain A, crystal structure of rat carnitine palmitoyltrasferase 2 proteins. Together, these activities may reduce hepatocytic triglyceride deposition, thereby decreasing steatosis, as demonstrated by the modulatory effects on ornithine aminotransferase, mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, acyl-CoA synthase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Sericin activity further balanced nitrogenous waste detoxification, characterised by carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (ammonia), aldehyde dehydrogenase and uricase, or folate biosynthesis via sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethyl glycine dehydrogenase. These results suggest that sericin maintains the hepatic mitochondrial architecture through apoptotic, autophagic, energy maintenance and anti-oxidative mitochondrial proteins for alleviating hepatic steatosis and promoting liver function under conditions of hypercholesterolaemia."

However, their practical deployment has been hindered by some issues related to corrosion and passivation of the zinc anode in an alkaline electrolyte. In this work, anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and nonionic surfactant Pluronic F-127 (P127) are examined their applicability to enhance the battery performances. Pristine zinc granules in 7 M KOH, pristine zinc granules in 0–8 mM SDS/7 M KOH, pristine zinc granules in 0–1000 ppm P127/7 M KOH, and SDS coated zinc granules in 7 M KOH were examined. Cyclic voltammograms, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that using 0.2 mM SDS or 100 ppm P127 effectively suppressed the anode corrosion and passivation. Nevertheless, direct coating SDS on the zinc anode showed adverse effects because the thick layer of SDS coating acted as a passivating film and blocked the removal of the anode oxidation product from the zinc surface. Furthermore, the performances of the zinc-air flow batteries were studied. Galvanostatic discharge results indicated that the improvement of discharge capacity and energy density could be sought by the introduction of the surfactants to the KOH electrolyte. The enhancement of specific discharge capacity for 30% and 24% was observed in the electrolyte containing 100 ppm P127 and 0.2 mM SDS, respectively."

Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes for cancer-related death worldwide with rapidly increasing incidence and mortality rates. As for other types of cancers, also in HCC cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumour initiation, progression and therapy failure. However, as rare subpopulations of tumour tissue, CSCs are difficult to isolate, thus making the development of suitable and reliable model systems necessary. In our study, we generated HepG2 subclones with enriched CSC potential by application of the spheroid formation method and subsequent single-cell cloning. Analyses in several 2D and 3D cell culture systems as well as a panel of functional assays both in vitro and in vivo revealed that the generated subclones displayed characteristic and sustained features of tumour initiating cells as well as highly aggressive properties related to tumour progression and metastasis. These characteristics could clearly be correlated with the expression of CSC markers that might have prognostic value in the clinical HCC setting. Therefore, we conclude that our CSC enriched HepG2 clones certainly represent suitable model systems to study the role of CSCs during HCC initiation, progression and drug resistance."

Energy Science & Engineering published by the Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Due to its fast-growing and high carbohydrate content, Napier grass has a great potential to be chosen as a raw material for renewable energy production. The Napier grass after different pretreatments was tested for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with dried yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and cellulase (CTec2) to produce ethanol. For alkaline pretreatment, the grass was incubated with 10% NaOH at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) at 90°C for 1 hour. For dilute acid pretreatment, the grass was soaked with 1% H2SO4 at a ratio of 1:10 (w/v) and incubated at 120°C for 1 hour. For the two-stage pretreatment, the resultant solid from dilute acid pretreatment was further treated with 2% NaOH (1:10 w/v) at 80°C for 6 hours. After enzymatic saccharification at 50°C and pH 5.0 for 96 hours using CTec2, yields of glucose from three pretreated Napier grass samples (10% water-insoluble solids, WIS) were 75.4 ± 2.9%, 55.4 ± 6.5%, and 76.4 ± 5.0%. Using 10% WIS of alkaline-pretreated Napier grass biomass as the substrate, the 72-hour SSF led to an ethanol yield of 86.6 ± 3.4%. On the basis of the dried biomass of Napier grass as the raw material, the ethanol yield could reach 0.143 ± 0.006 (g/g). Napier grass biomass could be effectively treated by alkaline, dilute acid, or two-stage pretreatment methods to remove non-cellulosic components to some extent. Alkaline pretreatment was found to be superior to dilute acid and two-stage pretreatment methods, based on ethanol yields obtained under similar SSF conditions."

In this paper, the pyrolyzed products were separated into water/aqueous and bio-oil fractions, and the yield was characterized. Pyrolysis was performed in a screw-driven custom-built pyrolysis reactor. The effects of pyrolysis parameters, including the temperature (400–650 °C), feedstock feed rate (0.3–1.8 kg h−1), average size distribution (250 µm, 500 µm and 750 µm) and N2 sweeping gas flow rate (80–240 cm3 min−1) were investigated systematically. The results show that the temperature and residence time according to the N2 sweep gas also mainly affects the bio-oil yield and properties such as the acidity, heating value, viscosity and chemical composition, with the highest bio-oil yield (40.16 wt%) obtained at 500 °C, a feed rate of 0.4 kg h−1, an average biomass feedstock particle size of 500 µm, and an inert N2 flow rate of 120 cm3 min−1. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the chemical composition revealed aromatic derivatives, phenols, ketones, and oxygenated compounds of high molecular weight that might be useful chemical products. These results indicate that pyrolyzed oil cannot be utilized as a biofuel directly but instead must be pretreated. The oil should be treated by a co-catalytic pyrolysis process to be considered a potential source for energy and valuable chemicals. In addition, the biochar was analyzed to determine whether it can be used for the production of activated carbon."

The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs > 0.9, P < 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846). Conclusion: The findings support validity and reliability of OWD, and offer a clear cut-off point to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis for clinical utility in various settings."

Kinetic and thermodynamics analysis showed that Pd(II) extraction was of first-order reaction: the reaction was endothermic reaction which was governed by the diffusion region. The influence of temperature on isotherm model was also investigated. With an increase in reaction temperature, all three isotherms Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm become inaccurate. Results show that the Langmuir isotherm model was preferred for the study of the Pd(II) ion experimental isotherm. Response surface methodology was employed to study the five independent variables which have an effect on the percentage of extraction of palladium(II) ions as a dependent variable. Optimum extraction conditions for the five independent variables were as follows: Aliquat 336 concentration (0.6 M), pH of feed solution (2.0), stirring speed (600 rpm), reaction time (10 min.) and reaction temperature (318 K)."
"['Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism', 'Physiology', 'Histology']","Loss of Gsα in osteocytes leads to osteopenia due to sclerostin induced suppression of osteoblast activity  2018The stimulatory subunit of G-protein, Gsα acts as a secondary messenger of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that primarily activates cAMP-induced signaling. GPCRs, such as the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR), are critical regulators of bone formation as shown by number of genetic manipulation studies targeting early osteoblast lineage cells. In this study, we have examined the role of Gsα in osteocytes, the terminally differentiated and most abundant cells of the osteoblast lineage. Mice lacking the stimulatory subunit of G-proteins (Gsα) in osteocytes (DMP1-GsαKO) have significant decrease of both trabecular and cortical bone, as assessed by μCT. Histomorphometric analysis showed that the osteopenia was mostly driven by more than 90% decrease in osteoblast numbers and activity whereas osteoclasts were only slightly decreased. The decrease in osteoblast number was associated with a striking lack of endocortical osteoblasts. We have previously shown that loss of the stimulatory subunit of G-proteins (Gsα) in osteocytes in vitro or in vivo induces high expression of sclerostin. To determine if the increased sclerostin levels contributed to the decreased endosteal bone lining cells and osteopenia, we treated wild-type mice with recombinant sclerostin and the DMP1-GsαKO mice with anti-sclerostin antibody. Treatment of wild-type mice with 100 μg/kg sclerostin for 3-weeks significantly reduced the numbers of bone lining cells and led to osteopenia. Next, the DMP1-GsαKO and control littermates were treated with the anti-sclerostin antibody (25 mg/kg, 2 times per week) for 4-weeks. Upon the antibody treatment, the endocortical osteoblasts reappeared in the DMP1-GsαKO mice to a comparable level to that of the vehicle treated control littermates. In control mice, E11/gp38 positive osteocytes were observed in parallel with the endocortical osteoblasts with higher dendrite density towards the endocortical osteoblasts. In DMP1-GsαKO mice, E11/gp38 positive osteocytes were lacking dendrites and were randomly scattered throughout the bone matrix. After treatment with anti-sclerostin antibody, DMP1-GsαKO mice showed increased E11/gp38 positive osteocytes near the endosteal bone surface and endosteal osteoblasts. The anti-sclerostin antibody treatment proportionally increased the bone volume but it could not completely rescue the osteopenia in the DMP1-GsαKO mice. Taken together, this data suggests that Gsα signaling in osteocytes leads to osteopenia driven, at least in part, by increased secretion of sclerostin."

Some authors have reported successful management of such cases without removing the PD catheter - by instilling an antifungal lock into the retained PD catheter. However, the use of antifungal locks has generally not been well accepted as the standard treatment for fungal peritonitis in PD patients. We report two cases where antifungal lock were performed in PD patients presented with PD-related fungal infection that not only had no effect on abating the infection but also causing paradoxical outcomes."

Study Design: Three human hemimandibles were scanned by using the 3D Accuitomo 170 scanner (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan). First, 3 combinations of kilovolt (kV) and milliampere (mA) were used at a constant radiation dose. Seven observers evaluated the images; the kV of the highest-scoring scan was considered optimal. Second, the lowest acceptable mA for visualizing different anatomic structures was determined. Finally, the samples were scanned by using 3 combinations of tube current and exposure time; the observers determined the combination with the highest image quality. Results: At a constant radiation dose, the highest available voltage (i.e., 90 kV) resulted in the highest image quality in terms of general impression, sharpness, noise, and artefacts. Depending on the anatomic structure, mA reductions of 20% to 40% compared with the default setting were possible. Fast-scan protocols showed equal or slightly better image quality compared with the standard-scan mode. Conclusions: For the CBCT model used in this study, optimization implies the use of the highest kV along with the shortest exposure time and a task-specific mA. The proposed stepwise optimization approach could be applied to any CBCT unit, preferably during commissioning."

The study's aim is to investigate the effects of gabapentin on alcohol drinking. One hundred twelve Thai individuals with alcohol dependence and very high alcohol consumption were randomly assigned to either of two groups: gabapentin treatment or placebo. Oral treatment with at least 300 mg of gabapentin per day or placebo was administered once a day for twelve weeks. The alcohol drinking pattern was assessed by means of the timeline followback method. The drinking behaviours of the two groups were compared by means of the Poisson repeated measures model and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis. Twenty subjects (35.7%) from the gabapentin group and 14 subjects (25.0%) from the placebo group completed the study protocol. The participants in the gabapentin group did not differ from those in the placebo group with respect to demographics or baseline alcohol drinking behaviour. After follow-up, the gabapentin group showed a lower percentage of heavy drinking days per week than the placebo group (p < 0.005). GEE analysis showed treatment by time interaction on lowering drinking days within a week (p < 0.05). In conclusion, gabapentin may be used to reduce alcohol-drinking behaviours."

In this study, we investigated clinical and genetic features of their families and examined the functional significance of these two variants in vitro. Methods: Clinical and genetic data were collected. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression in cld cells were performed. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mass and activity were measured. Results: In vitro studies showed that LPL mass and activity in the media of cells transfected with the p.Arg270Gly variant were significantly reduced. In the cell lysates, however, LPL mass was preserved but LPL activity was reduced, suggesting that the LPL defect was in the secretion and activity. For the p.Asp308Glyfs*3 variant, LPL mass in the cell lysate was relatively preserved compared to that of the wild-type, while LPL mass in the media was decreased albeit not significantly. LPL activities in the cell lysate and in the media of cells transfected with this variant were significantly reduced, suggesting that the p.Asp308Glyfs*3 variant might affect the activity, and possibly, secretion of LPL. Conclusions: These novel variants in the LPL gene were likely pathogenic with the defect in secretion and/or activity."
['Pharmaceutical Science'],"Topical drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye: The effect of benzalkonium chloride on topical dexamethasone penetration into the eye in vivo  2018 Elsevier B.V.Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is a quaternary ammonium compound with antibacterial properties. It is used as preservative in aqueous eye drops but studies have shown that it can also act as a penetration enhancer increasing drug permeation from the eye surface into the eye. Here the effect of BAC on dexamethasone permeation into the eye was investigated in vivo. Dexamethasone in aqueous cyclodextrin-based eye drops with and without BAC, were administered to rabbits and the dexamethasone concentration in several eye tissues determined 2 h after the administration. The study shows that BAC has no effect on the drug penetration from the eye surface into the eye. The penetration enhancing effect of BAC is mainly based on in vitro observations where BAC is in contact with isolated epithelial membrane (e.g., cornea) for several hours. Under in vivo conditions, BAC is rapidly washed from the eye surface with the tear fluid before it can penetrate into the epithelia and disrupt its structure sufficiently to allow for enhanced drug permeation into the eye."

The co-exist phase of both structure which occurred during the different film growth conditions was fully explained. Phonon dispersion and the Born criteria reveal that Zincblende is only stable up to 10 GPa. Besides, Wurtzite structure yield no imaginary phonon frequencies and also satisfy the elastic constants sufficiency condition up to 20 GPa which indicated that the co-exist phase would eventually become the single Wurtzite structure above 10 GPa. The electronic structure and PDOS were also fully investigated using HSE06. The multiple band gap energy and mid O-3 state between fundamental ZnS band gap was revealed for the first time.

PCC 6803. Growth rate, intracellular pigment contents including chlorophyll a and carotenoids, and oxygen evolution rate of all overexpressing (OX) strains were normally similar as wild type. For fatty acid compositions, saturated fatty acid, in particular palmitic acid (16:0) was dominantly increased in OX strains whereas slight increases of unsaturated fatty acids were observed, specifically linoleic acid (18:2) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3). The plsC/plsX-overexpressing (OX + XC) strain produced high lipid content of about 24.3%w/dcw under normal condition and was further enhanced up to 39.1%w/dcw by acetate induction. This OX + XC engineered strain was capable of decreasing phaA transcript level which related to poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis under acetate treatment. Moreover, the expression level of gene transcripts revealed that the plsX- and plsC/plsX-overexpression strains had also increased accA transcript amounts which involved in the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Altogether, these overexpressing strains significantly augmented higher lipid contents when compared to wild type by partly overcoming the limitation of lipid production."

In this study, we initially isolated and identified host-derived LAB from the gut of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed two candidate LAB, the Lactobacillus plantarum strain SGLAB01 and the Lactococcus lactis strain SGLAB02, which exhibited 99% identity to the L. plantarum strain LB1-2 and the L. lactis strain R-53658, which were isolated from bee gut, respectively. The two LAB displayed antimicrobial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including the virulent acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND)-causing strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND). Viable colony count and SEM analysis showed that the two candidate LAB, administered via oral route as feed supplement, could reside and adhere in the shrimp gut. Double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing of LvproPO1 and LvproPO2 revealed a significant role of two LvproPOs in the proPO system as well as in the immune response against VPAHPND infection in L. vannamei shrimp. The effect of LAB supplementation on modulation of the shrimp proPO system was investigated in vivo, and the results showed that administration of the two candidate LAB significantly increased hemolymph PO activity, the relative mRNA expression of LvproPO1 and LvproPO2, and resistance to VPAHPND infection. These findings suggest that administration of L. plantarum and L. lactis could modulate the immune system and increase shrimp resistance to VPAHPND infection presumably via upregulation of the two LvproPO transcripts."

This 3-year multicenter study was conducted on elderly Thai patients with AML, and aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and factors impacting the survival outcome of the patients. From the 235 elderly patients with AML, patients with poor performance status and patients receiving low-intensive therapy had significantly poorer survival outcome. Background: Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poorer prognosis than younger ones. Several factors contribute to the poor outcomes for this patient group. Patients and Methods: This study investigated the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of elderly Thai patients with AML. This 3-year, prospective, multicenter study was focused on Thai patients with AML aged over 60 years who were diagnosed between 2014 and 2016. Results: Of 680 patients with AML, 235 elderly patients with AML (34.6%) were identified, with a mean age of 70 ± 8 years. Using a 3-group cytogenetic risk classification (favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk), the proportions of patients in each category were 3.6%, 73.8%, and 22.6%, respectively. The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 846 days. The median overall survival (OS) of the patients was 128.2 days (range, 0-1205 days), with a 1-year OS of 13%. From a multivariate analysis, the significant factors associated with an improved long-term OS were patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2 and those receiving intensive therapy. Conclusion: Our study confirms the high prevalence of AML in elderly patients with generally poor outcomes. Selected patients with a good performance status and those who received intensive induction treatment could have a long-term survival."

Methods: The susceptibility of 53 F. columnare isolates to 11 antimicrobials, including 2 quinolones, was investigated by the disk diffusion method. Oxolinic acid (OXO) was subsequently chosen for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Sequence analysis of four genes within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of OXO-resistant F. columnare compared with susceptible isolates was subsequently performed. Results: The disk diffusion assay revealed that the majority of isolates were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials. However, 14 and 8 isolates were resistant to the quinolone antibiotics OXO and nalidixic acid, respectively. No multidrug resistance was observed. The MIC assay revealed five additional isolates that were resistant to OXO (≥4 μg/mL), making a total of 19 OXO-resistant isolates observed in this study. DNA sequencing identified missense mutations both in parC and gyrA but not in gyrB or parE in QR F. columnare isolates. Mutation in parC resulted in the change His87 → Tyr. For gyrA, 15 isolates of Thai origin exhibited a change at residue Ser83 to either Phe, Tyr or Ala, whereas 3 Vietnamese isolates contained two mutation sites (Ser83 → Phe and Asp87 → Tyr).

The preliminary results demonstrated that similar compounds, including glyceraldehyde (GCD), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glycolic acid (GCOA), formaldehyde (FMD) and glycolaldehyde (GCAD), were generated from the photocatalytic oxidation of glycerol via both photocatalysts, but they differed in their yields. The black TiO2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity to convert glycerol than the commercial TiO2, due to the presence of some defective structure and its low band gap energy, and also promoted the generation of GCAD as the main product. In contrast, the commercial TiO2 promoted the formation of GCD as the major product. The principle reactive oxidizing species (ROS) contributing for glycerol conversion via black TiO2 can be ranked in the order of O2 •->O12>OHb •>h+/OHs •>h+. The dominate ROS related to the conversion of glycerol to GCD and DHA were O2 •- and OHb •, respectively. The main ROS to alter GCD and DHA to GCAD/FMD was O2 •-, while the h+ was the principle ROS to convert GCD to GCOA. Finally, the pathway of glycerol conversion and product distribution over black TiO2 via various ROS in the presence of oxygen as electron acceptor is proposed."

A number of truly non-local and semi-local exchange correlation density functionals are examined by comparing calculated structural parameters with experimental results. The vdW-DF-cx which takes into account the non-local van der Waals correlation and consistent exchange shows the best overall performance for density functional theory study of this system. Remarkable distinctions between results from vdW-DF-cx and those from PBEsol exchange correlation functionals are observed and indicate the need of including the non-local interaction in the study of this system, especially its dynamical properties. The obtained rotational barriers are 18.56 meV/formula and 27.71 meV/formula which correspond to rotational frequencies of 3.71 THz and 2.60 THz for vdW-DF-cx and PBEsol calculations, respectively. Interestingly, the maximally localised Wannier function analysis shows the hydrogen bonding assisted covalent character of two iodide anions at a moderate rotational angle which can lead to I2 formation and then material degradation."

Although the inflammatory pattern of ECRS is essential to diagnosing this subtype, there is currently no consensus for diagnosis. Our aim in this study was to determine whether high tissue eosinophilia (HTE), measured as eosinophils per high-power field (eos/HPF), could be used to define ECRS based on likelihood of recurrence. Methods: Embase, Medline, and PubMed databases were searched for studies that reported HTE and recurrence in ECRS patients after surgical treatment. We used a random-effects bivariate meta-analysis to calculate summary sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) for detecting ECRS at different HTE cut-off scores using risk of recurrence as the primary outcome. Results: We identified 11 articles (n = 3183) that reported HTE associated with recurrence. A cut-off value of >55 eos/HPF showed the highest sensitivity (0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.91), specificity (0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99), and DOR (232.7; 95% CI, 91.0-595.1). Meta-regression analysis performed showed that the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies score (p = 0.1287), geographic location (p = 0.3745), follow-up time (p = 0.2879), and study design (p = 0.1865) did not affect the test accuracy. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that using eos/HPF has good diagnostic accuracy and may be a useful tool for identifying ECRS patients. Based on the results of our meta-analysis, we recommend a cut-off value of >55 eos/HPF for predicting the likelihood of recurrence of ECRS."

The estimation of simulation uncertainty is indispensable in using best-estimate computational codes. A key of successful two-phase flow simulations is to use the state-of-the-art constitutive equations to close the mathematical system used in two-phase flow analyses. The advanced constitutive equations should be developed based on “physics” behind phenomena and should consider scaling parameters which enable their application beyond test conditions used for a code validation. Two-phase flow simulations in a rod bundle is important in various industrial apparatuses such as heat exchangers and nuclear reactors. Constitutive equations for two-phase flows in a vertical rod bundles have been advanced in recent five years. In view of this, this paper provides a comprehensive review of most advanced constitutive equations for two-phase flow analyses in a vertical rod bundle. The constitutive equations of two-phase flow parameters reviewed in this paper are flow regime map, void fraction, void fraction covariance and relative velocity covariance, interfacial area concentration and wall friction. In addition, an exact formulation of one-dimensional momentum equation in two-fluid model considering void fraction distribution is discussed."

To determine the presence of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand, retrospective serum samples collected from 1,000 free-grazing ducks during 2008–2015 were tested for DTMUV infection. Our result showed that 91 (9.10%) were positive for DTMUV neutralizing antibodies and DTMUV seropositive ducks have been detected in Thailand since 2008. To further investigate the seroprevalence and geographic distribution of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand, a cross-sectional serological survey of DTMUV was conducted in 2016. Of 1,200 free-grazing ducks in the 60 flocks from 20 provinces located in the major free-grazing duck raising areas of Thailand, 365 (30.42%) were positive for DTMUV neutralizing antibodies and 56 flocks (93.33%) had at least one DTMUV seropositive duck. Additionally, DTMUV seropositive ducks were observed in all provinces tested. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the presence of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks since 2008 and widespread DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand with a relatively high seroprevalence. These findings suggest the potential role of free-grazing ducks in the dissemination of DTMUV and highlight the necessity of systemic DTMUV surveillance in free-grazing ducks in addition to farm ducks for early detection, prevention, and control of this emerging disease."

Frequencies ranging from 0.75 to 100 kHz were probed for capacitance and conductance, and 5 kHz frequency was found suitable for monitoring natural rubber vulcanization. The results show that capacitance during curing correlated with the time profile of torque from a moving die rheometer (MDR).

For the theoretical method, a trans-IG monomer and a trans-IG bound with two water molecules (IG.2W) were optimized in the ground state using the B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 calculations with the 6-31 + G(d,p) basis set and the SCRF-CPCM model for taking solvent effect into account was also applied. Sequentially, the UV–Visible spectra and λmax of the optimized trans-IG and IG.2W models in the implicit water were simulated by the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The TD-DFT methods including BLYP, B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X, ωB97XD, LC-BLYP, and LC-ωPBE functionals without and with the D3 correction and the 6-31 + G(d,p) basis set were selected. The results pointed out that BLYP and BLYP-D3 were the best methods because they could reproduce the experimental λmax value of IG in aqueous solution. The predicted λmax values of IG.2W were almost equal to 708 nm (the experimental data), indicating that IG.2W could be responsible for optical properties of IG."

To clarify its tectonic evolution of spreading, basin-infilling, and closure, we have investigated the provenance of its clastic sediments, the U-Pb ages of detrital zircons, the geochemistry of its basaltic rocks, and the structures in mélange. The rocks in the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin include two contrasting lithological units: the Thung Kabin Mélange, composed mainly of basaltic rocks, chert, limestone, and sandstone, along with mélange; and the Pong Nam Ron Formation, a thick succession of clastic sediments. Our observations suggest that the clastic sediments of the Pong Nam Ron Formation were deposited widely over the oceanic rocks (basaltic rocks, chert, and limestone) of the Thung Kabin Mélange. Geochemical analyses indicate that sandstones in both units (the Thung Kabin Mélange and the Pong Nam Ron Formation) are characterized by a provenance of mostly basaltic rocks. The U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from both units present similar age distributions: the youngest single-grain zircon (YSG) is early Late Triassic in age, the youngest cluster of zircons (YC1σ) is latest Permian to earliest Triassic in age, and there is a range of other Paleozoic and Proterozoic zircons. Based on these geochemical analyses and the U-Pb dating, the sandstones of both units had the same provenance. In addition, the basaltic rocks of the Thung Kabin Mélange are originated from back-arc basin basalts. These new observations have allowed us to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the basin. In the Early Permian, spreading took place in the basin accompanied by basaltic magmatism. Subsequently, corresponding to an inactive period of the Sukhothai Arc into the Middle Triassic, the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin subsided, and a deep-sea environment prevailed with the formation of Permian cherts, Permian limestones, and Middle Triassic cherts. During the Triassic, the basin was filled by clastic sediments and eventually closed. The clastic sediments were sourced directly from the back-arc basin basalts, as well as from the felsic volcanic rocks of the active Sukhothai Arc (which yield Permian to Triassic zircons), and from the continental materials of the Indochina Block (Paleozoic and Proterozoic zircons). After the closure of the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin, the discussed area was affected by the termination fault-fan related to the Mae Ping Fault Zone."
['Dermatology'],"Ultrasound evaluation of arterial anastomosis of the forehead  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Color Doppler ultrasound has a potential role as an imaging guide in aiding filler injections which are blinded procedures. Objective: This study investigated the forehead arteries and provided insight into their anastomoses. This was performed by challenging their function to provide blood through these anastomoses when the main artery was temporary occluded by compression. Methods: Three arteries were identified on each side of the forehead, the supratrochlear, the supraorbital and the superficial temporal arteries. Under ultrasound monitoring, each target artery and corresponding anastomosis was studied separately by compressions performed in a sequential and accumulative manner. Results: Data from the current study imply that accidental cannulation of either the supratrochlear artery or the supraorbital artery can cause ophthalmic artery embolization in every case recorded. If the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery is cannulated, the chance of blindness as a complication occurs in one fifth of volunteers. Anastomosis between both sides of the terminal branches of ophthalmic arteries creates the possibility of bilateral ocular complications when accidental cannulation occurs at one of these branches, especially the supratrochlear artery. Thus, injury to the supratrochlear artery carries a greater risk of complication than the supraorbital artery. Conclusion: These findings emphasize that the chance of ocular complication is less when accidental cannulation occurs at the superficial temporal artery compared with injury to the supratrochlear or the supraorbital arteries as the terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery. Ultrasound can assist in the identification and evaluation of all the arteries at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of vascular complications."

Here, we further investigate the associated σ-algebras of the product of certain copulas and obtain (1) a sharper result on the partial factorizability of non-atomic copulas and (2) the existence and uniqueness of a completely factorizable copula that shares the same set of associated σ-algebras as that of a given non-atomic copula."

Under an optimized growth condition by RF-magnetron sputtering technique, the AlSb films were grown at a sputtering power of 250 W and a pressure of 0.01 mbar in argon atmosphere and a precursor Al:Sb ratio of about 88:12. The undoped AlSb films were found to have a cubic crystal structure with (111) preferred orientation and a lattice constant of 5.9985 Å under compressive strain. For the doped AlSb samples with optimized doping contents, the AlSb:Si and AlSb:Cu films with higher compressive strain were found to have a smaller lattice constant of 5.9588 Å and 5.9667 Å respectively. Raman spectroscopy indicated strain states and lower crystalline quality induced by doping. The optical properties, analyzed by UV–Vis spectrophotometry, showed that the undoped AlSb film was transparent to IR at around 850 nm, where the doped films were transparent to IR at longer wavelengths. To evaluate the electrical properties of the AlSb films, n-type AlSb:Cu and p-type AlSb:Si films were characterized by Hall-Effect measurements. To develop AlSb-based optoelectronic devices, a PIN diode structure was grown on Si substrate. The smooth interfaces between the AlSb layers and with Si substrate were confirmed by cross-sectional TEM micrographs. Finally, I-V measurements showed diode characteristics with a turn-on voltage of about + 1.5 V for forward bias and −0.5 V for reverse bias. In summary, the AlSb-based diode structure on Si substrate had been successfully fabricated by optimized sputtering deposition. This is promising for future development of the AlSb-based optoelectronic devices."

Mice deficient in Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIB) exhibit spontaneous SLE and its restoration rescues the disease. To determine whether deleting FcγRIIB affects cortical bone mass and mechanical properties, we analyzed cortical bone phenotype of FcγRIIB knockouts at different ages. FACS analysis revealed that 6-month-old FcγRIIB−/− mice had increased B220lowCD138+ cells, markers of plasma cells, indicating active SLE disease. In contrast, 3-month-old FcγRIIB−/− mice did not develop the active SLE disease. µCT analysis indicated that FcγRIIB deletion did not affect cortical bone in 3-month-old mutants. However, 6- and 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males and females had osteopenic cortical bone and the severity of bone loss increased with disease duration. FcγRIIB deletion decreased cross-sectional area, cortical area, and marrow area in 6-month-old males. Cortical area and cortical thickness were decreased in 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males. Lack of FcγRIIB decreased cortical thickness without affecting cortical area in females. However, deletion of a single FcγRIIB allele was insufficient to induce cortical bone loss. The bending strength was decreased in 6- and 10-month-old FcγRIIB-deficient males compared to WT controls. A microindentation analysis demonstrated significantly decreased hardness in both 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males and females. Our data indicate that FcγRIIB contributes to the regulation of cortical bone homeostasis subsequent to SLE development and that deletion of FcγRIIB in mice leads to SLE-like disease associated with cortical bone loss and decreased bending strength and hardness."

Therefore, the conversion of chitosan to chitosan oligosaccharides with specific molecular weight has been continuously investigated in order to find effective strategies that can achieve both economic feasibility and environmental concerns. In this study, a novel process was developed to heterogeneously degrade chitosan powder by highly active species generated by electrical discharge plasma in a dilute salt solution (0.02 M) without the addition of other chemicals. The degradation rate obtained from the proposed process was comparable to that obtained from some other methods with the addition of acids and oxidizing agents. Separation of the water-soluble degraded products containing chitosan oligosaccharides from the reaction solution was simply done by filtration. The obtained chitosan oligosaccharides were further evaluated for an influence of their molecular weights on cytotoxicity against cancer cells and the selectivity toward cancer and normal cells."

A green tea catechin, epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), which is thought to inhibit various amyloidoses, is a potent inhibitor of amyloid fibril formation in AL amyloidosis. Methods: An amyloidogenic variable domain in λ6 light chain mutant, Wil was incubated in the presence of EGCG. The incubation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC. The interaction between Wil and EGCG was observed by using NMR and tryptophan fluorescence. Results: EGCG inhibited the amyloid fibril formation of Wil at pH 7.5 and 42 °C. Under these conditions, most Wil populations were in the unfolded state and several chemical reactions, i.e., oxidation and/or covalent bond oligomerization could be induced by auto-oxidated EGCG. Moreover, we found that EGCG bound to the unfolded state of Wil with higher affinity (Kd = 7 μM). Conclusions: Inhibition of amyloid fibril formation of Wil was caused by 1) EGCG binding to unfolded state rather than folded state and 2) chemical modifications of Wil by auto oxidation of EGCG. General significance: In the competitive formation of amyloid fibrils and off-pathway oligomers, EGCG produces the latter immediately after it preferentially binds to the unfolded state. It may be general mechanism of EGCG inhibition for amyloidosis."

There are 16 known isozymes of α-CA in humans, which differ widely in their kinetics, subcellular localization and tissue-specific distribution. Several disorders are associated with abnormal levels of CA, and so the inhibition of CA has pharmacological application in the treatment of many diseases. Currently, searching for novel CA inhibitors (CAI) has been performed using in vitro methods, and so their toxicity remains unknown at the time of screening. To obtain potentially safer CAIs, a screening procedure using an in vivo assay seems to have more advantages. Here, we developed a yeast-based in vivo assay for the detection of inhibitors of the human CA isozyme II (hCAII). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant deprived of its own CA (Δnce103 strain) can grow under a high CO2 condition (5% (v/v) CO2) but not at an ambient level. We constructed Δnce103 strains expressing various levels of hCAII from a plasmid harboring the hCAII gene arranged under the control of variously modified GAL1 promoter and relying on the expression of hCAII for growth under low CO2 condition. Using a multidrug-sensitive derivative of the Δnce103 strain expressing a low level of hCAII, we finally established a high throughput in vivo assay for hCAII inhibitors under a low CO2 condition. Cytotoxicity of the candidates obtained could be simultaneously determined under a high CO2 condition. However, their inhibitory activities against other CA isozymes remains to be established by further investigation."

Objective: To explore Thai nephrology nurses’ perceptions about discussing sexual health issues with patients receiving dialysis. Material and Methods: A phenomenological approach was applied and data were collected using semi-structured individual interviews. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 participants from four Southern regional hospitals in Thailand between April and June 2016. Recruitment continued until data saturation was reached. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's method. Findings: Participants were aged between 27 and 53 years: mean 42.95 (±7.62 SD). Nineteen were female and sixteen were married. Five themes emerged: (1) improving knowledge in order to enhance confidence before discussing sexuality with patients; (2) gaining patients’ trust before discussing sexuality; (3) finding an appropriate time to discuss sexuality; (4) organising a suitable setting in which to discuss sexuality and (5) feelings of appreciation for helping patients and their partners overcome their sexual health issues. Conclusion: These findings provide an understanding of Thai nurses’ perceptions about the challenges in communicating with patients experiencing ESKD regarding sexual health problems and concerns. The findings suggest that sexual health education and training would enhance the confidence of Thai nephrology nurses in initiating sexuality-related discussions with their patients."

A decongestant and INCS combination (INCS-D) is considered for nasal congestion that is not improved by INCS. This study aimed to investigate the effects of INCS-D on chronic rhinitis. Methods: Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Randomized controlled trials studying the effects of INCS-D vs INCS alone for treating chronic rhinitis were included. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Outcomes were nasal symptoms, disease-specific quality of life, objective tests for nasal patency, and adverse events. Results: Six studies (1071 patients) met the inclusion criteria. There were no differences between INCS-D and INCS on total nasal symptom scores (standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.09 to 0.40; p = 0.18), nasal congestion scores (SMD −0.13; 95% CI, −0.46 to 0.20; p = 0.43), and the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score (SMD −0.12; 95% CI, −0.66 to 0.42; p = 0.66). After 1 week, there were no differences on objective tests for nasal patency (acoustic rhinometry: SMD 0.04; 95% CI, −0.68 to 0.76, p = 0.91; and peak nasal inspiratory flow: SMD 0.08; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.32; p = 0.52). Adverse events were not different between INCS-D and INCS (risk ratio 1.09; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.62). Conclusion: Meta-analyses did not show benefits of topical decongestants addition to INCS. Adverse events of INCS-D were comparable with INCS."

Changes in physicochemical (L* a* b* color values, pH and thiobarbituric acid (TBA)), microbiological (total viable counts (TVC) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB)) and sensory (color, odor and overall acceptability) characteristics of the packaged sausages were monitored during storage at 4 ± 1 °C. Reflectance spectra covering a wavelength range of 400–1000 nm of the samples were acquired using HSI. The relationships between the quality attributes and the spectroscopic reflectance were investigated using canonical correlation analysis. Among all quality attributes, L* color value, TBA, TVC, LAB, odor and overall acceptability appeared to be highly associated with the reflectance. To facilitate the HSI for rapid image acquisition and data processing, partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was employed for selection of optimal wavelengths. The selected wavelengths were then assembled into multispectral data and used as input variables to optimize the PLSR and artificial neural network models for the prediction of quality attributes of the sausage samples. The HSI technique can be used for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of the product's quality and shelf life."

To improve its properties further, CG was encapsulated into polysaccharide-based nanoparticles in this study. A chitosan/alginate nanoparticulate system was chosen for encapsulation of CG due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, mucoadhisiveness and good film formation. CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles were prepared by o/w emulsification and ionotropic gelification, with the conditions optimized using response surface methodology. A chitosan/alginate mass ratio of 0.04:1, CG concentration of 3 mg/mL and Pluronic®F127 concentration of 0.50% (w/v) were determined to be optimal for the nanoparticle preparation. FTIR and XRD confirmed encapsulation of CG into the chitosan/alginate nanoparticles. The CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles showed better stability under UV radiation and in a simulated gastrointestinal environment, compared to a CG dispersion in water. The nanoparticles showed slow cumulative release of CG in simulated gastrointestinal fluids without enzymes and in body fluid. A Weibull model of the best fit for all conditions suggested that the release pattern of CG from CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles was mainly controlled by Fickian diffusion and erosion of polymer materials. Finally, CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles showed higher in vitro cellular uptake in human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2 cells) and better anticancer activity against Caco-2, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Therefore, the CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles are a promising approach for oral administration of CG for cancer treatment."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Ethanol as an electrolyte additive for alkaline zinc-air flow batteries  2018, The Author(s).Zinc-air flow batteries exhibit high energy density and offer several appealing advantages. However, their low efficiency of zinc utilization resulted from passivation and corrosion of the zinc anodes has limited their broad application. In this work, ethanol, which is considered as an environmentally friendly solvent, is examined as an electrolyte additive to potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous electrolyte to improve electrochemical performance of the batteries. Besides, the effects of adding different percentages of ethanol (0–50% v/v) to 8 M KOH aqueous electrolyte were investigated and discussed. Cyclic voltammograms revealed that the presence of 5–10% v/v ethanol is attributed to the enhancement of zinc dissolution and the hindrance of zinc anode passivation. Also, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that adding 5–10% v/v ethanol could effectively suppress the formation of passivating layers on the active surface of the zinc anodes. Though the addition of ethanol increased solution resistance and hence slightly decreased the discharge potential of the batteries, a significant enhancement of discharge capacity and energy density could be sought. Also, galvanostatic discharge results indicated that the battery using 10% v/v ethanol electrolyte exhibited the highest electrochemical performance with 30% increase in discharge capacity and 16% increase in specific energy over that of KOH electrolyte without ethanol."

Results are scattered across many studies and meta-analyses, and they often mix obese and overweight individuals. Materials and methods: PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched through 21 January 2017 for meta-analyses of cohort studies assessing environmental risk factors for obesity, and randomized controlled trials investigating nonpharmacological and nonsurgical therapeutic interventions for obesity. We excluded data on overweight participants. Evidence from observational studies was graded according to criteria that included the statistical significance of the random-effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of obesity cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction intervals, small-study effects and excess significance. The evidence of intervention studies for obesity was assessed with the GRADE framework. Results: Fifty-four articles met eligibility criteria, including 26 meta-analyses of environmental risk factors (166 studies) and 46 meta-analyses of nondrug, nonsurgical interventions (206 trials). In adults, the only risk factor with convincing evidence was depression, and childhood obesity, adolescent obesity, childhood abuse and short sleep duration had highly suggestive evidence. Infancy weight gain during the first year of life, depression and low maternal education had convincing evidence for association with paediatric obesity. All interventions had low or very-low-quality evidence with one exception of moderate-quality evidence for one comparison (no differences in efficacy between brief lifestyle primary care interventions and other interventions for paediatric obesity). Summary effect sizes were mostly small across compared interventions (maximum 5.1 kg in adults and 1.78 kg in children) and even these estimates may be inflated. Conclusions: Depression, obesity in earlier age groups, short sleep duration, childhood abuse and low maternal education have the strongest support among proposed risk factors for obesity. Furthermore, there is no high-quality evidence to recommend treating obesity with a specific nonpharmacological and nonsurgical intervention among many available, and whatever benefits in terms of magnitude of weight loss appear small."

The hexavalent chromium was pre-concentrated using the HF-LPME technique via ion exchange or a coupled transport process through a supported ionic liquid (Aliquat 336) prior to colorimetric detection with diphenylcarbazide on the µPAD. The violet colour could be seen by the naked eye. Images from the µPADs were scanned using a commercial desktop scanner at 600 dpi resolution. ImageJ software was used for quantitative analysis by measuring the intensity values at green colour channel since it gave the best sensitivity among the RGB colour. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range 10–90 µg L-1, with a limit of detection of 3 µg L-1. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the level of hexavalent chromium spiked into natural water samples at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level, and the results were in good agreement with those obtained using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The developed method was able to improve the detection limit of the conventional µPAD, and was expected to be used for the effective analysis of hexavalent chromium in natural water."

Current DIVA vaccines and assays are highly effective in the control and/or eradication of ADV, but detection of wild-type ADV infection relies on testing individual pig specimens, for example, serum or muscle exudate (“meat juice”). Oral fluid specimens have been shown to be highly effective for the surveillance of a variety of swine pathogens and could offer the means to improve the efficiency of ADV surveillance in the field. In this study, the temporal patterns of ADV DNA and antibody detection in oral fluid and serum specimens were established in ADV-inoculated pigs (n = 14) using gB and gE PCRs, virus neutralization (VN) and three commercial serum antibody ELISAs (gB bELISA, gI bELISA and ADV iELISA). ADV DNA was detected in oral fluid samples (20% to 100%) from 3 to 21 days postinoculation (DPI), but not in serum. ADV antibody was detected in oral fluid specimens at DPI ≥ 10 with the gB bELISA (36% to 79%) and ADV iELISA (29% to 100%), but not the gI bELISA.

Although relatively rare, resistance emergence during therapy leads to treatment failures with high mortality rates. In the absence of acquired external resistance determinants in B. pseudomallei emergence of β-lactam resistance is invariably caused by mutational modification of genomically encoded factors. These include the deletion of the ceftazidime target penicillin-binding protein 3 or amino acid changes in the Class A PenA β-lactamase that expand its substrate spectrum, as well as penA gene duplication and amplification or its overexpression via transcriptional up-regulation. Evidence is presented that penA is co-transcribed with the upstream nlpD1 gene, that the transcriptional terminator for nlpD1 serves as a penA attenuator and that generation of a new promoter immediately upstream of the terminator/attenuator by a conserved G to A transition leads to anti-termination and thus constitutive PenA expression and extended β-lactam resistance. Further evidence obtained with the extensively β-lactam resistant clinical isolate Bp1651 shows that in addition to PenA overexpression and structural mutations other adaptive mechanisms contribute to intrinsic and acquired B. pseudomallei β-lactam resistance."

However, mechanisms underlying JAK/STAT signaling-mediated breast tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here, we showed that GRAMD1B expression is upregulated on IL-6 but downregulated upon treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 in the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably, Gramd1b knockdown caused morphological changes of the cells, characterized by the formation of membrane ruffling and protrusions, implicating its role in cell migration. Consistently, GRAMD1B inhibition significantly enhanced cell migration, with an increase in the levels of the Rho family of GTPases. We also found that Gramd1b knockdown-mediated pro-migratory phenotype is associated with JAK2/STAT3 and Akt activation, and that JAK2 or Akt inhibition efficiently suppresses the phenotype. Interestingly, AG490 dose-dependently increased p-Akt levels, and our epistasis analysis suggested that the effect of JAK/STAT inhibition on p-Akt is via the regulation of GRAMD1B expression. Taken together, our results suggest that GRAMD1B is a key signaling molecule that functions to inhibit cell migration in breast cancer by negating both JAK/STAT and Akt signaling, providing the foundation for its development as a novel biomarker in breast cancer."

The pulp metabolome, including 157 annotated metabolites, was explored using capillary electrophoresis-time of flight/mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS). Cultivars and harvest years had more impact on metabolite profile separation than cultivation areas. We identified cultivar-dependent metabolite markers related to durian fruit quality traits, such as nutritional value (pyridoxamine), odor (cysteine, leucine), and ripening process (aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid). Interestingly, durian fruit were found to contain high amounts of γ-glutamylcysteine (810.3 ± 257.5 mg/100 g dry weight) and glutathione (158.1 ± 80.4 mg/100 g dry weight), which act as antioxidants and taste enhancers. This metabolite information could be related to consumer preferences and exploited for durian fruit quality improvement."

In this study, the physicochemical properties of starches isolated from seed kernels of three Thai mango cultivars (Namdokmai, Kaew, and Chokanan), mainly used in the industry, were characterized and compared with those of other commercial starches namely tapioca, corn, low-, and high-amylose rice. MSK starches possessed a smooth-oval shape granule with average diameter of 12.90–13.20 µm. They were higher in lipid (0.53–0.55%) and amylose (31.50–33.12%) than other starches. Amylopectin and amylose of MSK starches had a relatively low molecular weight. Amylopectin of MSK starches had higher proportion of B1 and B2 chains but lower proportion of A chain than those of other starches. These chemical properties contributed to changes in value of following properties of MSK starches: higher crystallinity (40.20–41.30%), higher gelatinization temperature (78.13–82.39 °C) and enthalpy (17.32–19.45 J/g), higher pasting temperature (81.6–84.4 °C) and peak viscosity (356.2–423.8 rapid viscoanalyzer units). Amylopectin of MSK starches also retrograded to a higher extent than that of other starches. Based on their physicochemical properties, MSK starches; especially Kaew cultivar, could be a potential source of resistant starch; particularly of RS2."

Here, we investigated structural and regulatory genes involved in BIA accumulation in lotus. Two clustered CYP80 genes were identified to be responsible for the biosynthesis of bis-BIAs and aporphine-type BIAs, respectively, and their tissue-specific expression causes divergence in alkaloid component between leaf and embryo. In contrast with the common (S)-reticuline precursor for most BIAs, aporphine alkaloids in lotus leaf may result from the (S)-N-methylcoclaurine precursor. Structural diversity of BIA alkaloids in the leaf is attributed to enzymatic modifications, including intramolecular C-C phenol coupling on ring A and methylation and demethylation at certain positions. Additionally, most BIA biosynthetic pathway genes show higher levels of expression in the leaf of high-BIA cultivar compared with low-BIA cultivar, suggesting transcriptional regulation of BIA accumulation in lotus. Five transcription factors, including three MYBs, one ethylene-responsive factor, and one basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), were identified to be candidate regulators of BIA biosynthesis in lotus. Our study reveals a BIA biosynthetic pathway and its transcriptional regulation in lotus, which will enable a deeper understanding of BIA biosynthesis in plants."

The alternansucrase-encoding gene from Leuconostoc citreum ABK-1 (Lcalt) was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Lcalt encoded LcALT of 2,057 amino acid residues; the enzyme possessed an optimum temperature and pH of 40 °C and 5.0, respectively, and its' activity was stimulated up to 2.4-fold by the presence of Mn2+. Kinetic studies of LcALT showed a high transglycosylation activity, with Km 32.2 ± 3.2 mM and kcat 290 ± 12 s-1. Alternan generated by LcALT (Lc-alternan) harbours partially alternating α-1,6 and α- 1,3 glycosidic linkages confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and partial hydrolysis of Lc-alternan products. In contrast to previously reported alternans, Lc-alternan can undergo self-assembly, forming nanoparticles with an average size of 90 nm in solution. At concentrations above 15% (w/v), Lc-alternan nanoparticles disassemble and form a high viscosity solution, while this polymer forms a transparent film once dried."

To achieve metastasis, cancer cells acquire the ability to undergo a switch from epithelial to mesenchymal behaviour, termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Drug discovery attempts have been made to find potent compounds that will suppress EMT. Cypripedin, a phenanthrenequinone isolated from Thai orchid, Dendrobium densiflorum, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities. In this study, we found that cypripedin attenuated typical mesenchymal phenotypes, including migratory behaviour, of non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells, with a significant reduction of actin stress fibres and focal adhesion and with weakened anchorage-independent growth. Western blot analysis revealed that the negative activity of this compound on EMT was a result of the down-regulation of the EMT markers Slug, N-Cadherin and Vimentin, which was due to ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (Akt) inactivation. As a consequence, the increase in the Slug degradation rate via a ubiquitin-proteasomal mechanism was encouraged. The observation in another lung cancer H23 cell line also supported this finding, indicating that cypripedin exhibits a promising pharmacological action on lung cancer metastasis that could provide scientific evidence for the further development of this compound."

We identified 65 SNPs with P values < 10-4 located within the HLA class I region and three SNPs were genotyped in three independent population-based replication sets. Meta-analysis confirmed the association of the three SNPs (rs2523961: OR = 1.73, P = 7.50 × 10-12; rs1110446: OR = 1.79, P = 1.66 × 10-13; and rs3094137: OR = 1.73, P = 7.09 × 10-9). We then performed two-field HLA genotype imputation for six HLA loci using genotyping data to investigate the association between HLA alleles and HCC. HLA allele association testing revealed that HLA-A ∗ 33:03 (OR = 1.97, P = 4.58 × 10-4) was significantly associated with disease progression to HCC. Conditioning analysis of each of the three SNPs on the HLA class I region abolished the association of HLA-A ∗ 33:03 with disease progression to HCC. However, conditioning the HLA allele could not eliminate the association of the three SNPs, suggesting that additional genetic factors may exist in the HLA class I region."

However, the role of surfactant adsorption affecting enzymatic hydrolysis has not been elaborated well. In this work, nonionic surfactants differing in their molecular structures, namely the polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), the secondary alcohol ethoxylate (Tergitol 15-S-9), and the branched alcohol ethoxylate (Tergitol TMN-6), were studied for their effects on the enzymatic hydrolysis of palm fruit bunch (PFB). The PFB was pretreated with a 10% w/v sodium hydroxide solution and then hydrolyzed using the cellulase enzyme from Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 26921) at 50 °C and pH 5. The optimal conditions providing similar yields of reducing sugar required Tween 80 and Tergitol TMN-6 at 0.25% w/v, while Tergitol 15-S-9 was required at 0.1% w/v. All the surfactants improved the enzymatic conversion efficiency and reduced unproductive binding of the enzyme to lignin. In addition, the adsorption isotherm of cellulase was fit well by the Freundlich isotherm, while adsorption of the three nonionic surfactants agreed well with the Langmuir isotherm. Adsorption capacities of the three nonionic surfactants were consistent with their enhancement efficiencies in hydrolysis. The critical micelle concentration was observed as a key property of nonionic surfactant for adsorption capacity."

Background and Objectives: First-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) is one of the most commonly used estimation methods in nonlinear mixed effects modeling, while the stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM) is the newer estimation algorithm. This work aimed to compare the performance of FOCEI and SAEM methods when using NONMEM ® with the classical one- and two-compartment models across rich, medium, and sparse data. Methods: One- and two-compartment models of the previous studies were used to simulate data in three scenarios: rich, medium, and sparse data. For each scenario, there were 100 data sets, containing 100 individuals in each data set. Every data set was estimated with both FOCEI and SAEM methods. The simulation and estimation were performed using NONMEM ® . The completion rates, percentage of relative estimation errors (%RERs), root mean square errors (RMSEs), and runtimes were considered to assess the completion, accuracy, precision, and speed of estimation, respectively. Results: Both FOCEI and SAEM methods provided comparable completion rates, median %RERs (ranged from − 9.03 to 3.27% for FOCEI and − 9.17 to 3.27% for SAEM) and RMSEs (ranged from 0.0004 to 1.244 for FOCEI and 0.0004 to 1.131 for SAEM) for most parameters in both models across three scenarios. The run times were much shorter with FOCEI (ranged from 0.18 to 0.98 min) compared to SAEM method (ranged from 4.64 to 12.03 min). Conclusions: For the classical one- and two-compartment models, FOCEI method exhibited comparable performance similar to SAEM method but with significantly shorter runtimes across rich, medium, and sparse sampling scenarios."

However, the stability of HFSLM system is a significant challenge. Pseudoemulsion-hollow fiber strip dispersion (PEHFSD) system, providing excellent stability, is attracting research attention. In this work, the recovery of Y(III) by PEHFSD system using di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) as a carrier was investigated. The effects of several operating parameters, including the initial concentration of Y(III) in the feed phase, the flow rate of feed, the stirring speed and the volumetric ratio of feed to strip on Y(III) separation were studied. The Y(III) transport was analyzed on the concentration ratio of Y(III) ions, percent extraction, percent stripping and overall mass transfer coefficient (K p ). The PEHFSD system outperformed HFSLM system regarding separation performance and stability. K p of HFSLM system decreased after the second run, but K p of PEHFSD system remained constant even at the fifth run. The dispersed droplets in the strip dispersion phase in the PEHFSD system enhanced separation performance and stability of the membrane module."

As an example, we consider a slab of left-handed metmaterial (LHM) with both relative permittivity and permeability equal to -1. Simulation results show that when the LHM slab moves at a high speed, its electromagnetic responses are drastically different from the static case. Specifically, when the LHM slab moves toward the source, for the case of normal incidence, there exists a special velocity at which fields experience a zero spatial phase delay through the LHM slab; while for the oblique incidence, above a certain velocity fields inside the LHM become evanescent. On the other hand, when the LHM slab moves away from the source, for the case of normal incidence, at the same special velocity the magnitudes of both electric and magnetic fields inside the LHM slab reach their minimum values; for the oblique incidence, the slab functions as a field converter. Besides, the transmitted waves through the LHM slab experience a red-shift (to a lower frequency) and the shift is proportional to the velocity of the LHM slab regardless of the moving direction."

Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of nearly complete CanineCV genomes suggested that natural recombination had occurred among different lineages of CanineCV's. Similarity plot and bootscaning analyses indicated that American and Chinese viruses had served as major and minor parental viruses, respectively. Positions of recombination breakpoints were estimated using maximum-likelihood frameworks with statistical significant testing. The putative recombination event was located in the Replicase gene, intersecting with open reading frame-3. Analysis of nucleotide changes confirmed the origin of the recombination event. This is the first description of naturally occurring recombinant CanineCV's that have resulted in the circulation of newly emerging CanineCV lineages."

The purpose of the present study was to identify the specific domain (""effector"") within the BGN core protein that facilitates BMP-2 osteogenic function. Thus, we generated various recombinant and synthetic peptides corresponding to several domains of BGN, and tested their effects on BMP-2 functions in vitro. The results demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeats 2-3 domain (LRR2-3) of BGN significantly enhanced the BMP-2 induced Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation, osteogenic gene expression, and alkaline phosphatase activity in myogenic C2C12 cells. Furthermore, addition of LRR2-3 to osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells accelerated in vitro mineralization without compromising the quality of the mineral and matrix. These data indicate that LRR2-3 is, at least in part, responsible for BGN's ability to enhance BMP-2 osteogenic function, and it could be useful for bone tissue regeneration."

A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted. One hundred and seventy-eight post cesarean section patients were either randomized to the study group receiving oral ginger capsules or to the placebo group receiving oral placebo capsules. The average age of the studied women was 32.3 years. The incidence of postoperative abdominal distention was not different between the ginger and the placebo groups (20.2% vs 29.2%, p = 0.328). The efficacy to relieve abdominal distention was superior in the ginger group than the placebo group (91% vs 65.2%, p < 0.001). With regards to quality of life, the number of patients who had the ability to eat was higher in the ginger group than in the placebo group (59.6% vs 43.8%, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in time to first flatus, maternal satisfaction, and side effects. Ginger does not decrease the incidence of post cesarean section abdominal distention. But, ginger is more effective than the placebo in relieving the severity of abdominal distention on the fourth day after operation and improving the ability to eat."

However, nursing home-based studies on prevalence and risk factors of depression are scarce due to feasibility and difficulties in data collection. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted at three nursing homes (NHs) in three districts in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. A total of 181 elderly NH residents aged ≥60 were recruited purposively. Information regarding socio-demographics, health-related characteristics and social support among respondents were collected by a modified questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. A short form Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Indonesian version was employed to assess levels of depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the data. Results: Overall, the prevalence of geriatric depression was assessed to be at 42.5% (31.5% in women and 11% in men). Risk factors that were found to be significantly associated with depression in the univariate analysis were female, none or lack of social support, had ≥3 chronic diseases, and perceived inadequacy of care. In the multivariate analysis, perceived inadequacy of care remained significant risk factor for depression amongst the elderly NH residents. Limitations: Besides a number of important variables were determined by self-report, the used sampling technique was purposive. In addition, the elderly who had severe cognitive impairment or dementia and were not able to communicate meaningfully were excluded from this study. Conclusions: The prevalence rates of depression were relatively high among elderly NH residents in our study area. Adequate health services are needed in order to reduce the risk of depression among elderly NH residents."

We have demonstrated that maternal SE during pregnancy increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult offspring. Mitochondrial oxidative damage contributes to the adverse effects of maternal smoking on renal disorders. MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that has been shown to protect against oxidative damage-related pathologies in many diseases. Female Balb/c mice (8 weeks) were divided into Sham (exposed to air), SE (exposed to cigarette smoke) and SEMQ (exposed to cigarette smoke with MitoQ supplemented from mating) groups. Kidneys from the mothers were collected when the pups weaned and those from the offspring were collected at 13 weeks. Maternal MitoQ supplementation during gestation and lactation significantly reversed the adverse impact of maternal SE on offspring's body weight, kidney mass and renal pathology. MitoQ administration also significantly reversed the impact of SE on the renal cellular mitochondrial density and renal total reactive oxygen species in both the mothers and their offspring in adulthood. Our results suggested that MitoQ supplementation can mitigate the adverse impact of maternal SE on offspring's renal pathology, renal oxidative stress and mitochondrial density in mice offspring."

The hydrogel preparation of cellulose and VNR was performed by mixing a cellulose solution in 6 wt% lithium chloride in N,N-dimethylacetamide with VNR in toluene at a 10, 15 and 20 wt% VNR loading level. The solution was then exposed to ethanol vapor for 1 day. The cellulose–VNR composites at 10–20 wt% VNR showed an excellent reinforcement, in terms of higher elastic and mechanical properties, even though the composite hydrogels retained a high amount of water (about 870–2400%). The nanosize morphology of the composite hydrogels indicated that the roughly aggregated VNR found in the cellulose medium formed with an interconnection layer between both the cellulose and VNR components, where the VNR was surrounded with fibrous cellulose medium. The resulting interconnection between the hydrophobic VNR and hydrophilic cellulose domains at higher VNR-loading levels enhanced the mechanical and elasticity properties of the bio-composite hydrogels."

Goats were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent approximately 10,000 years ago, and are now globally distributed. It is not known if the Plasmodium identified in African goats originated from parasites circulating in the local ungulates, or if it co-evolved in the goat before its domestication. To address this question, we performed PCR-based surveillance using a total of 1,299 goat blood samples collected from Sudan and Kenya in Africa, Iran in west Asia, and Myanmar and Thailand in southeast Asia. Plasmodium DNA was detected from all locations, suggesting that the parasite is not limited to Africa, but widely distributed. Whole mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed that there was only one nucleotide substitution between Zambian/Kenyan samples and others, supporting the existence of a goat-specific Plasmodium species, presumably Plasmodium caprae, rather than infection of goats by local ungulate malaria parasites. We also present the first photographic images of P. caprae, from one Kenyan goat sample."

In this study, the effects of cyperenoic acid on osteoclast differentiation were investigated both in vitro and in vivo using receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced bone marrow-derived osteoclasts and senescence-accelerated mouse prone 6 (SAMP6). Cyperenoic acid significantly suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation at the concentrations with no apparent cytotoxicity. The half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) for osteoclast differentiation was 36.69 μM ± 1.02. Cyperenoic acid treatment evidently reduced the expression of two key transcription factors in osteoclast differentiation, NFATc1 and c-Fos. Detailed signaling analysis revealed that cyperenoic acid did not affect MAPK pathways and canonical NF-κB pathway but impaired activation of p100/p52 in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway upon RANKL stimulation. Moreover, the expression of osteoclast-related genes, nfatc1, ctsk, irf8, acp5 and cfos were disrupted by cyperenoic acid treatment. The bone resorption activity by cyperenoic acid-treated osteoclasts were impaired. In a senile osteoporosis mouse model SAMP6, mice fed on diet supplemented with cyperenoic acid showed delay in bone loss, compared to the control. Taken together, plant-derived cyperenoic acid shows great potential as therapeutic agent for osteoporosis."
"['Neurology', 'Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience']","The Compensatory Immune-Regulatory Reflex System (CIRS) in Depression and Bipolar Disorder  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Here, we review a novel concept namely the compensatory immune-regulatory reflex system (CIRS) as applied to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). There is evidence that a substantial subset of individuals with MDD and BD exhibit an activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), as indicated by an increased production of macrophagic M1 and T helper (Th)-1 pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 trans-signaling, positive acute phase proteins (APPs), and complement factors. These immune aberrations appear to be evident during the course of major affective episodes of either depressive or (hypo) manic polarity. Here, we review (a) the current state of the art of CIRS functions in both mood disorders and (b) the possible role of CIRS-related biomarkers for the understanding of affective disorders within the framework of precision psychiatry that could also provide novel drug targets for both MDD and BD. CIRS-related abnormalities in mood disorders include elevated Th-2 and T regulatory (Treg) activities with increased IL-4 and IL-10 production, classical IL-6 signaling, increased levels of sIL-1R antagonist (sIL-1RA), soluble IL-2 (sIL-2R) and tumor necrosis factor–α- receptors, and positive APPs, including haptoglobin, hemopexin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α1-antitrypsin, and ceruloplasmin. It is concluded that CIRS is involved in MDD and BD by regulating the primary immune-inflammatory response, thereby contributing to spontaneous and antidepressant-promoted recovery from the acute phase of illness. Signs of activated IRS and CIRS pathways are observed in the remitted phases of both disorders indicating that there is no return to the original homeostasis after an acute episode, while later episodes of mood disorders are characterized by sensitized IRS and CIRS responses. New z-unit weighted composite biomarker scores are proposed, which reflect different aspects of IRS versus CIRS activation and may be used to estimate different IRS/CIRS activity ratios in mood and other neuroimmune disorders."

We proposed the transition mechanism from the fcc to host-guest (HG) structures at finite temperature and high pressure. This complex structural phase transformation has been calculated using ab initio lattice dynamics with finite displacement method which confirms the dynamical harmonic stabilization of the HG structure. The electron distribution between the host-host atoms has also been investigated by electron localization function (ELF). The strongly localized electron of p bond has led to the stability of the HG structure. This remarkable result put the HG structure to be a common high-pressure structure among alkali metals.
"['Neurology', 'Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience']","The Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Neuroprogressive Diseases: Emerging Pathophysiological Role and Translational Implications  2018, The Author(s).The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main cellular organelle involved in protein synthesis, assembly and secretion. Accumulating evidence shows that across several neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive diseases, ER stress ensues, which is accompanied by over-activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although the UPR could initially serve adaptive purposes in conditions associated with higher cellular demands and after exposure to a range of pathophysiological insults, over time the UPR may become detrimental, thus contributing to neuroprogression. Herein, we propose that immune-inflammatory, neuro-oxidative, neuro-nitrosative, as well as mitochondrial pathways may reciprocally interact with aberrations in UPR pathways. Furthermore, ER stress may contribute to a deregulation in calcium homoeostasis. The common denominator of these pathways is a decrease in neuronal resilience, synaptic dysfunction and even cell death. This review also discusses how mechanisms related to ER stress could be explored as a source for novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive diseases. The design of randomised controlled trials testing compounds that target aberrant UPR-related pathways within the emerging framework of precision psychiatry is warranted."

The standard biomarkers such as anti-dsDNA and complements (C3 and C4) do not always correlate with active clinical SLE. The heterogeneity of SLE patients may require additional biomarkers to designate disease activity. Ninety SLE patients participated in this study. Evaluation of disease activity was achieved with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and modified SLEDAI-2K. The measured serum biomarkers were anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, ESR, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and circulating immune complexes (CIC). IL-6, ESR and CIC significantly increased in active clinical SLE. Complement, anti-dsDNA, ESR and CIC correlated with SLEDAI-2K while only anti-dsDNA, CIC, ESR and IL-6 correlated with modified SLEDAI-2K. A combination of biomarkers gave a higher odds ratio (OR) than any single biomarker. A combination of IL-6 or CIC exhibited the highest OR (OR = 7.27, 95%CI (1.99-26.63), p = 0.003) while either complement or anti-dsDNA showed a moderate odds ratio (OR = 3.14, 95%CI (1.16-8.48), p = 0.024) of predicting clinical active SLE. The combination of CIC and IL-6 strongly predicts active clinical SLE. CIC and IL-6 can be used in addition to standard biomarkers to determine SLE activity."

A simple and effective reagent that can bring functional proteins into cells can increase efficacy and allow more investigations. Here we show that the relatively non-toxic and non-immunogenic oxidized carbon black particles (OCBs) prepared from commercially available carbon black can deliver a 300 kDa protein directly into cells, without an involvement of a cellular endocytosis. Experiments with cell-sized liposomes indicate that OCBs directly interact with phospholipids and induce membrane leakages. Delivery of human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs, 150 kDa) with specific affinity towards dengue viruses (DENV) into DENV-infected Vero cells by OCBs results in HuMAbs distribution all over cells' interior and effective viral neutralization. An ability of OCBs to deliver big functional/therapeutic proteins into cells should open doors for more protein drug investigations and new levels of antibody therapies and biological studies."

Tetrahydrofuran was used as the organic solvent to control the interaction and sol–gel reaction of the silica source and aminosilanes. The effect of the type and concentration of the added aminosilanes on the physicochemical properties of the resulting HMS-NH2 materials were investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and solid-state 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed a successful functionalization of the HMS surface with different amine groups. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy indicated that their wormhole-like mesostructured framework was retained after functionalization at a high APS loading level (15 mol%) or using AEEA as the aminosilane precursor. A high degree (88–98%) of aminosilanes was incorporated into the HMS framework, corresponding to an amine concentration of 0.72–2.16 mmol g−1. The HMS-NH2 materials had a high surface area (272–627 m2 g−1), a large total pore volume (0.48–1.92 cm3 g−1) and exhibited an enhanced adsorption capacity for clofibric acid in aqueous solution."

The in-process prediction model of tool wear is developed during the CNC turning process. The relations of the cutting speed, the feed rate, the depth of cut, the decomposed cutting forces, and the tool wear are investigated. The Daubechies wavelet transform is used to differentiate the tool wear signals from the noise and broken chip signals. The decomposed cutting force ratio is utilized to eliminate the effects of cutting conditions by taking ratio of the average variances of the decomposed feed force to that of decomposed main force on the fifth level of wavelet transform. The tool wear prediction model consists of the decomposed cutting force ratio, the cutting speed, the depth of cut, and the feed rate, which is developed based on the exponential function. The new cutting tests are performed to ensure the reliability of the tool wear prediction model. The experimental results showed that as the cutting speed, the feed rate, and the depth of cut increase, the main cutting force also increases which affects in the escalating amount of tool wear. It has been proved that the proposed system can be used to separate the chip formation signals and predict the tool wear by utilizing wavelet transform even though the cutting conditions are changed."

All rights reserved.Patients with advanced cancer cope with various issues, especially psychological symptoms, such as anxiety about death. Previous research from various countries indicates that most advanced cancer patients perceive distress before death, which means they cannot accept death peacefully. The purpose of this study was to examine the factors associated with death acceptance of Thai patients with advanced cancer. The participants were 242 adult patients with advanced cancer from three tertiary hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand. The research instruments consisted of 7 questionnaires: a personal information questionnaire, the death anxiety questionnaire, Buddhist beliefs about death questionnaire, the unfinished task questionnaire, general self-efficacy scale, family relationship questionnaire, and death acceptance scale. These instruments were tested for their content validity by a panel of experts. All instruments except the first one were tested for reliability, and their Cronbach's alpha coefficient were .86, .72, .74, .74, .89, and .70, respectively. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation, Point-biserial correlation coefficient, and stepwise multiple regression were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that a total of 42% of variance of death acceptance among Thai patients with advanced cancer was explained by death anxiety, Buddhist beliefs about death, and self-efficacy. Knowing these factors provides further information for nurses to help patients to cope with their death. From this crucial knowledge, nurses can develop interventions in decreasing or controlling anxiety about death, promoting Buddhist beliefs about death, and enhancing self-efficacy of advanced cancer patients. Therefore, a better quality of life and good death can be achieved."

All rights reserved.Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening disease with an incidence of approximately 2 persons per million per year. It is characterized by severe deficiency of the von Willebrand cleaving protease, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), leading to formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature. Prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, particularly plasma exchange, may be life-saving. Diagnosis of TTP is challenging because of its diverse clinical manifestations, overlap in clinical presentation with other thrombotic microangiopathies, and limited availability of ADAMTS13 testing. Clinical prediction scores have been developed to estimate the pretest probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and may be used as an adjunct to clinical judgment to guide initial management decisions. An ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 10% supports the diagnosis of TTP in appropriate clinical contexts, but many centers do not offer testing in-house and must send out the test to a reference laboratory with a turnaround time of several days. In such instances, initial management decisions must be made without the benefit of laboratory testing. In patients with TTP, inhibitor tests may be useful for distinguishing immune-mediated from congenital TTP. In this article, we review the epidemiology, natural history, and clinical presentation of TTP and laboratory assays for TTP including ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor assays. We also describe an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected TTP that integrates clinical and laboratory assessment."

The mechanism whereby Notch signaling regulates cellular transformation in hepatocytes is still controversial. This study investigated the impact of overexpressing truncated intracellular Notch1 (NICD1) on transcriptomic profiles of immortalized human hepatocytes. RNA sequencing and gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that extracellular matrix organization and hyaluronan biosynthesis process gene sets are among those affected by Notch hyperactivation. The relationship between Notch signaling and periostin, an extracellular matrix protein highly expressed in HCC, were further studied. Modulating Notch signaling through NICD1 overexpression or treatment with a gamma secretase inhibitor resulted in increased or decreased periostin expression, respectively, in HCC and liver bile duct carcinoma cell lines. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database, mRNA levels of NOTCH1 and POSTN are positively correlated in tumor tissues but not in nontumor tissues. Two consensus RBPJ binding motifs were identified in the −3932/-3921 and + 2522/+2533 bp of POSTN regulatory regions, and NOTCH1 is associated with these binding sites in a liver bile duct carcinoma cell line. Taken together, these results indicate that Notch signaling directly regulates transcription of POSTN in hepatocytes and liver cancer cell lines and may be a candidate for drug targeting in liver cancer."

The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV and recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. Events are selected by requiring the presence of a muon (μ), a photon (γ), an imbalance in transverse momentum from an undetected neutrino (ν), and at least two jets (j) of which exactly one is identified as associated with the hadronization of a b quark. A multivariate discriminant based on topological and kinematic event properties is employed to separate signal from background processes. An excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed, with a significance of 4.4 standard deviations. A fiducial cross section is measured for isolated photons with transverse momentum greater than 25 GeV in the central region of the detector.

Hence, retrieval the actual information covered by clouds is frequently necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel method to remove clouds by taking an advantage of HSI color space instead of directly removing clouds in RGB color space. The proposed method uses a concept of dark channel prior method to estimate the cloud appearance called the scattering light and perform a subtraction in only the intensity channel to avoid an effect to the original color and also enhance the intensity with gamma correction to recover some information accidentally removed from the previous step and restore obscure details distorted by clouds. Furthermore, since clouds involve in both intensity and saturation channel, we increase the saturation that was reduced as a result from clouds by using logarithm image transformation as well. From the results, the proposed method can remove clouds that are not extremely opaque and preserve the actual information such as color and texture due to the higher contrast gain in the experiments comparing to the results obtained from other single-image methods."

Although Rinorea is the second-largest genera within the Violaceae family, few studies have examined whether or not they contain cyclotides. To further our understanding of cyclotide diversity and evolution, we examined the cyclotide content of two Rinorea species found in Southeast Asia: R. virgata and R. bengalensis. Seven cyclotides were isolated from R. virgata (named Rivi1-7), and a known cyclotide (cT10) was found in R. bengalensis. Loops 2, 5, and 6 of Rivi1-4 contained sequences not previously seen in corresponding loops of known cyclotides, thereby expanding our understanding of the diversity of cyclotides. In addition, the sequence of loop 2 of Rivi3 and Rivi4 were identical to some related noncyclic ""acyclotides"" from the Poaceae plant family. As only acyclotides, but not cyclotides, have been reported in monocotyledons thus far, our findings support an evolutionary link between monocotyledon-derived ancestral cyclotide precursors and dicotyledon-derived cyclotides. Furthermore, Rivi2 and Rivi3 had comparable cytotoxic activities to the most cytotoxic cyclotide known to date: cycloviolacin O2 from Viola odorata; yet, unlike cycloviolacin O2, they did not show hemolytic activity.

The detection was based on a colorimetric reaction using bromocresol green (BG) in a phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 4 for the determination of albumin (AL) and creatinine (CR). BG changes color from greenish-yellow to bluish-green in the presence of AL and/or CR. Picric acid (PA) in 0.25 M NaOH was used to detect CR, and PA changes color from yellow to orange. Under the optimal conditions, the working range was 10 to 350 mg dL-1 with a detection limit of 7.1 and 5.4 mg dL-1 for AL + CR and CR detection, respectively. The repeatability was evaluated, and the %RSD value was less than 8.23 (n = 10). The ACR was obtained by calculating the AL and CR colorimetric results.

All rights reserved..We report on the discovery of a merger-driven starburst at z = 1.52, PACS-787, based on high signal-to-noise ALMA observations. CO(5-4) and continuum emission (850 μm) at a spatial resolution of 0.″3 reveal two compact (r 1/2 ∼ 1 kpc) and interacting molecular gas disks at a separation of 8.6 kpc, indicative of an early stage in a merger. With an SFR of 991 M o yr-1, this starburst event should occur closer to final coalescence, as is usually seen in hydrodynamical simulations. From the CO size, inclination, and velocity profile for both disks, the dynamical mass is calculated through a novel method that incorporates a calibration using simulations of galaxy mergers. Based on the dynamical mass, we measure (1) the molecular gas mass, independent from the CO luminosity, (2) the ratio of the total gas mass and the CO(1-0) luminosity (), and (3) the gas-to-dust ratio, with the latter two being lower than typically assumed. We find that the high star formation triggered in both galaxies is caused by a set of optimal conditions: a high gas mass/fraction, a short depletion time (τ depl = 85 and 67 Myr) to convert gas into stars, and the interaction of likely counter-rotating molecular disks that may accelerate the loss of angular momentum. The state of interaction is further established by the detection of diffuse CO and continuum emission, tidal debris that bridges the two nuclei and is associated with stellar emission seen by HST/WFC3. This observation demonstrates the power of ALMA to study the dynamics of galaxy mergers at high redshift."

Scientists have researched bacterial diversity of coral sites; however, a database for fungi and small eukaryotes from Thailand's sites with abundant corals is lacking. The present study combined fungal ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (F-RISA) and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to unveil the first culture-independent microbial and small eukaryotes from these sites at two times and across four species of coral (Porites lutea, Platygyra sinensis, Acropora humilis, and Acropora millepora), seawater and sediment. Results showed that the small eukaryotic communities on corals were distinct from communities in the surrounding seawater and sediment. The communities were relatively similar at the three sites and during the two periods of time. Pearson's correlations indicated the community diversity were associated with water quality (e.g., dissolved oxygen concentrations and density of water)."
"['Structural Biology', 'Molecular Biology']","Computational screening of fatty acid synthase inhibitors against thioesterase domain  2017,  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Thioesterase (TE) domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS) is an attractive therapeutic target for design and development of anticancer drugs. In this present work, we search for the potential FAS inhibitors of TE domain from the ZINC database based on similarity search using three natural compounds as templates, including flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids. Molecular docking was used to predict the interaction energy of each screened ligand compared to the reference compound, which is methyl γ-linolenylfluorophosphonate (MGLFP). Based on this computational technique, rosmarinic acid and its eight analogs were observed as a new series of potential FAS inhibitors, which showed a stronger binding affinity than MGLFP. Afterward, nine docked complexes were studied by molecular dynamics simulations for investigating protein–ligand interactions and binding free energies using MM-PB(GB)SA, MM-3DRISM-KH, and QM/MM-GBSA methods. The binding free energy calculation indicated that the ZINC85948835 (R34) displayed the strongest binding efficiency against the TE domain of FAS. There are eight residues (S2308, I2250, E2251, Y2347, Y2351, F2370, L2427, and E2431) mainly contributed for the R34 binding. Moreover, R34 could directly form hydrogen bonds with S2308, which is one of the catalytic triad of TE domain. Therefore, our finding suggested that R34 could be a potential candidate as a novel FAS-TE inhibitor for further drug design."

The present work, for the first time, demonstrates preparation of one pot triple network hydrogel of chitosan (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (HA-triazole/CS-Cu(II) gel), formed by triazole linkage, metal-coordination, and CS-HA polyion complexation. The salt containing water system favors polyion complex formation of CS and HA without precipitation. HA functionalized with alkyne and azide groups in aqueous EDC/NHS allows crosslinking of HA via triazole linkage using Cu(I) azide-alkyne Click chemistry (CuAAC). The required Cu(I) catalyst is generated from Cu(II) in the CS-Cu complex upon addition of sodium ascorbate. The CS/NHS system leads to the solubilization of CS, thus enabling ionic gelation.

The objectives of the current study were to estimate and rank the relative effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating HBV and HIV co-infected patients. Methods: Randomized trials, assessing the efficacy of antiviral drugs for HBV and HIV co-infected patients were searched in health-related databases. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Main outcome in this meta-analysis study was the success of treatment by antivirals as determined by virologic response. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis of these trials and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Results: Seven randomized trials (329 participants) were included in this network meta-analysis study. A network geometry was formed with six treatment options including four antiviral drugs, adefovir (ADV), emtricitabine (FTC), lamivudine (LMV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), combination treatment of TDF plus LMV, and placebo. The weighted percentage contributions of each comparison distributed fairly equally in the entire network of evidence. An assumption of consistency required for network meta-analysis was not violated (the global Wald test for inconsistency: Chi2(4) = 3.63, p = 0.46). The results of estimates showed no differences between the treatment regimens in terms of viral response for treating HBV and HIV co-infected patients, which spanned both benefit and harm (e.g. LMV vs TDF plus LMV: OR: 0.37, 95%CI: 0.06-2.41). Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low in all comparisons (e.g. LMV vs TDF plus LMV: 218 fewer per 1000,121 more to 602 fewer, very low certainty). Therefore, we remained uncertain to the true ranking of the antiviral treatments in HBV/ HIV co-infected patients. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the evidence is insufficient to provide guidance to the relative effectiveness of currently available antiviral drugs with dual activity in treating co-infection of HBV/HIV. Well-designed, large clinical trials in this field to address other important outcomes from different epidemiological settings are recommended."

All rights reserved..We present an analysis of the molecular gas properties, based on CO (2-1) emission, of 12 starburst galaxies at z ∼ 1.6 selected by having a boost (4×) in their star formation rate (SFR) above the average star-forming galaxy at an equivalent stellar mass. ALMA observations are acquired of six more galaxies than previously reported through our effort. As a result of the larger statistical sample, we significantly detect, for the first time at high z, a systematically lower /L IR ratio in galaxies lying above the star-forming ""main sequence"" (MS). Based on an estimate of CO (i.e., the ratio of molecular gas mass to ), we convert the observational quantities (e.g., /L IR) to physical units (M gas/SFR) that represent the gas depletion time or its inverse, the star formation efficiency. We interpret the results as indicative of the star formation efficiency increasing in a continuous fashion from the MS to the starburst regime, whereas the gas fractions remain comparable to those of MS galaxies. However, the balance between an increase in star formation efficiency and gas fraction depends on the adopted value of CO as discussed."

They offer a place where social media users can post information, express opinions, and share interests. However, some information and opinions may cause a negative impact on the person mentioned in the post and that person can become a target of defamation. In Thailand, although defaming someone on social media is illegal, most social media users are not aware of it. To raise awareness of this issue, this paper proposes the classification of defamatory text in Thai language. Several approaches to text classification are used to analyze textual comments to political news and articles on Facebook, including word n-grams, character ngrams, specific terms, grammatical dependency structure, and sentiment polarity. The experiment is conducted using two machine learning methods with several combination of the approaches. The result shows that SVM performed better than Naïve Bayes, and word n-grams and character n-grams are more efficient than other approaches with F score of 0.64 and accuracy of 0.74. In addition, dependency structure, specific terms, and sentiment polarity perform quite well with precision of 0.65 and accuracy of 0.66, but with lower recall rate of 0.35.

KGaA, WeinheimThe unique structural architecture of nacre from sea shells (e. g., mussel, pearl oyster, and abalone shells) is the basis of this substance's brilliant iridescent coloration. In fact, nacre consists of alternating bilayers of plate-shaped aragonite and an organic binder. In this paper, we first report the optical characteristics of individual aragonite plates derived from nacre. A simple chemical method is employed to disintegrate nacre without structural and polymorphism changes. Implementation of this method enable us to investigate the optical properties of individual aragonite plates. Evidence indicate that most light is transmitted by aragonite plates, a phenomenon that contributes substantially to the fantastic iridescent colors displayed by nacre. Reflected light, on the other hand, displays wavelength selectivity that depends on the thickness of the aragonite plates. As typical material applications, natural aragonite plates are utilized as transparent fillers and as a pigment for surface coating. Aside from their use as optical materials, aragonite plates can also be employed as a solid support for the growth of metal nanoparticles and utilize for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy."

The armor, with 12 mm Al backing plate, can successfully resist the NIJ-Type III treat with only combination of two composite layers. Different than hard and brittle plate, such as ceramic, the use of composite layer at the front did not blunt and erode the projectile, due to its ductile property. However, the composite layer effectively reduces the velocity of projectile, due to high fracture toughness, as a result of reinforcing steel wire mesh layers in the composites.

As cities constantly evolve, keeping an up-To-date map of POIs is difficult. However, by observing digital footprints of people, including taxi pick-up and drop-off locations, we can detect hotspots of activities that indicate POI locations by using techniques such as point clustering. DBSCAN is a popular density-based clustering algorithm for geographic data points. However, the effectiveness of the algorithm relies on determining appropriate parameters that match the distribution pattern of data points. That is hard because pick-up and drop-off locations are distributed differently in different areas.

Discriminant analysis identified group separation between OA and RA cohorts, with 32 metabolites significantly different between OA and RA SF (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Metabolites of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were lower in RA compared to OA; these results concur with higher levels of inflammation, synovial proliferation and hypoxia found in RA compared to OA. Elevated taurine in OA may indicate increased subchondral bone sclerosis. We demonstrate that quantifiable differences in metabolite abundance can be measured in low volumes of SF by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which may be clinically useful to aid diagnosis and improve understanding of disease pathogenesis."

We secondarily compared microRNA-21 expression between participants with normal and low bone mineral density (BMD: osteopenia and osteoporosis). Methods: Postmenopausal women who had never been diagnosed with fracture or never used anti-osteoporosis drugs were included in this study. Baseline characteristics were collected from all 195 participants. BTMs and plasma miR-21-5p were analyzed from blood collection at 8:00 and 9:00 am after overnight fasting for at least 8 h. Results: There was no significant correlation between miR-21-5p and any of the BTMs (CTx, r = 0.094, p = 0.19; P1NP, r = 0.05, p = 0.485). Significant correlation between miR-21-5p and P1NP was found when participants were further categorized into those aged ≥70 years (r = 0.46, p = 0.05) and those having osteoporosis (r = 0.51, p = 0.06). Slight negative correlations were found between miR-21-5p and BMD. There was statistically significant higher expression of miR-21-5p in those with low BMD when compared to the normal BMD group (p < 0.01). Conclusion: In this study, we did not find significant correlation between plasma microRNA-21-5p expression and the BTMs. Nevertheless, there seemed to be higher expression of miR-21-5p in the low BMD participants."

In contrast to prior research, however, this mixed methods study sought to illuminate the impact of ineffective leadership on teachers and school improvement. Quantitative data analysis affirmed that learning-centred leadership was associated with more active teacher engagement in professional learning, and that these effects were partially mediated by teacher trust and agency. However, additional quantitative analyses revealed that rural principals in our sample exercised significantly weaker learning-centred leadership than their urban counterparts, and that this was associated with lower levels of teacher trust, agency and professional learning. This quantitative analysis set the stage for a case study of one rural school principal whose school was unsuccessful in implementing a reform aimed at building teacher capacity. The qualitative data illuminate how sociocultural norms shaped interactions not only between the principal and his teachers (e.g. hierarchy), but among the teachers themselves (e.g. hierarchy and collectivism). Finally, the case study illustrates how ineffective leadership engenders mistrust and resistance among teachers, making them wary of assuming ownership of change."

Design: Prospective, cross-sectional, clinic-based study. Participants: Three gender- and age-matched cohorts of Korean, Chinese, and white participants recruited from general ophthalmology clinics in urban academic hospital settings. Methods: Anterior segment OCT (Visante OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) was used to image the AS of all participants. Customized software was used to calculate AS parameters. Main Outcome Measures: Five angle parameters (AOD500, AOD750, TISA500, TISA750, ARA), 5 iris parameters (IT750, IT2000, ITCM, Iarea, Icurv), and 5 anterior chamber parameters (ACD, ACW, ACA, ACV, LV) were compared. Anterior vault (AV), relative AV, and relative LV were also calculated. These parameters were compared across all cohorts using a Kruskal-Wallis test. General linear models were built to assess pairwise comparison between Korean and Chinese and between Korean and white cohorts. Two-sided P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We also considered Bonferroni correction to control family-wise type 1 error (ɑFW = 0.05 / 18 = 0.003). Results: The study included 132, 124, and 112 participants in the Korean, Chinese, and white cohorts, respectively. Korean participants showed AS parameters similar to those of Chinese participants, with the exception of having a smaller average ACW and a larger average IT2000.

The artifact leads to the information loss. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is not affected by this artifact. In this paper, we propose using the information from MR images to reproduces the information lost due to dental filling in CT images. First, we register the CT and MR images of the same patient. Then, we classify the skull into 3 regions: teeth, tissue near the teeth and others. For teeth and tissue near the teeth, we develop the mapping function between the intensity in the MR image to the mean intensity in the CT image. The pixels corrupted by the metal artifact are detected and their intensity are changed according to the mapping function with its MR intensity as the input. The proposed method significantly removed metal artifacts and could be used to improve the diagnosis and planning accuracy."

Therefore, this study analyzed bacterial communities (microbiota) from healthy corals and nearby seawater and sediment, using B-RISA and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Sampling was done in one dry and one wet season to provide an initial assessment of variation with environmental conditions. The most prevalent coral species were Porites lutea, Platygyra sinensis, Acropora humilis, and Acropora millepora. The B-RISA and the sequencing results were correlated, which increased confidence the results. The microbiota varied among corals, seawater, and sediment and between the wet and dry seasons. Percentages of bacteria with known functions varied among sample types and seasons, and their relative abundances supported previously reported essential functions, such as prevention of disease (e.g., Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter, and Cobetia were more abundant on corals in the dry season). Pearson's correlations and multiple factor regressions identified dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, salinity, and density as significant influences on the microbiota. The equations estimated the relative abundance of a community comprising 147 bacterial genera, as well as the relative abundance of Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Verrucomicrobium, and Epulopiscium (R2 ≥ 0.721).

To improve the management efficiency of C. belcheri, appropriate molecular markers are needed to be developed. In this study, microsatellites in C. belcheri were cross-amplified using type I microsatellites designed from express sequence tag (EST) of Crassostrea gigas. In total, 60 EST-derived microsatellites of C. gigas were tested and 41 loci (68.33%) generated the amplification product against genomic DNA of C. belcheri. Of these, 18 loci (43.90%) were polymorphic and were preliminary screened for estimation of a polymorphic level against C. belcheri originating from Surat Thani (N = 50). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 15 with an average number of 8.83 alleles per locus. The observed heterozygosity varied from 0.0000 to 0.8571 with an average of 0.3982 whereas the expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.4149 to 0.8930 with an average of 0.7487. These polymorphic microsatellites were further tested against bulked genomic DNA (5 bulks with 10 individuals for each bulk) from 5 different geographic locations. Thirteen pairs of primers generated the positive amplification products across all examined geographic samples while two pairs of primers yielded the amplification products only in the Surat Thani sample and they were regarded as candidate population-specific markers.

All rights reserved. FtsZ, a crucial protein in bacterial cell division has recently become of interest as target for the discovery of new antibacterial treatments. Owing to its conservation in prokaryote and the finding that is an inhibitor of FtsZ, it is expected to be developed as a new antibacterial drug with high specificity and rare occurrence of bacterial resistance. In this study, the antibacterial activities of Ecteinascidin 770 (ET770) and its effects on bacterial FtsZ were determined using in vitro and in silico methods. ET770 is a semi-synthesized product from marine tunicate classified as tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid. ET770 was proven as potential antibacterial agent against S. aureus, B. subtilis, MRSA and E. coli with an MIC of 2.02, 1.01, 2.02, and 32.43 µM, respectively. The effects of ET770 on bacterial cell division was investigated using E. coli str. K-12 substr. JW0093. Treating E. coli JW0093 with 0.1 mM of ET770 mostly induced filamentous forming and elongation of cell morphology. Whereas untreated E. coli JW0093 had a typical short rod and was a single-celled bacteria. Moreover, ET770 showed remarkable inhibition of GTPase-like activity of FtsZ with an IC 50 of 0.96 nM. The decrease of FtsZ polymerization ratio was observed using a dynamic light scattering technique when 10, 50 and 100 µM of ET770 were added to purified FtsZ. The binding of ET770 in the nucleotide binding pocket of the homology model of E. coli-FtsZ was predicted using flexible docking and its binding mode was analyzed. The overall results concluded that ET770 might be developed into a novel antibacterial drug through the inhibition of bacterial FtsZ."

All rights reserved. Jatropha curcas L. oil (JO) derived from both hexane extraction and mechanical screwpressing contains phorbol esters (PEs), which is a suspected carcinogen. This study proposed a JO extraction using mixed surfactant aqueous-based solutions under the appropriate proportion and physical conditions to obtain the highest free oil yield to reduce the PE partition in the oil. The results show that the anionic surfactant enhanced the free oil separation efficiency twofold compared with nonionic surfactant alone. The optimal condition is 1 min of contact time with 13.61 rad s -1 of orbital shaking and 1 g of the kernel per 10 mL of surfactants solution (30 g-Dehydol LS2, 0.2 g-Alfoterra 145-4PO and 6 g-NaCl in 1 L) which could yield 73% by mass fraction of oil for single extraction. The extracted PEs under that condition is higher in surfactant-rich phase and lower in free oil phase. The mass fraction of extracted PE distributed 53%, 29%, 17% and 1% in surfactant-rich phase, free oil, meal and aqueous phase, respectively. Mixed surfactants solution has ability to extract the oil and PEs in the one-step oil extraction. A half of PEs in the kernel was separated within the surfactant phase.

We take advantage of the current 3D printers' capabilities of combining highly concentrated inks with a large number of layers, to expand the spectral gamut of a set of inks. We use a data-driven method to both predict the spectrum of a printed ink stack and optimize for the stack layout that best matches a target spectrum. This bidirectional mapping is modeled using a pair of neural networks, which loss function helps find the best possible ink layout resulting in the balance between spectral reproduction and colorimetric accuracy under a multitude of illuminants. In addition, we introduce a novel spectral vector error diffusion algorithm based on combining color contoning and halftoning, which simultaneously solves the layout discretization and color quantization problems, accurately and efficiently. Our workflow outperforms the state-of-the-art models for spectral prediction and layout optimization. We demonstrate reproduction of a number of real paintings and historically important pigments using our prototype implementation that uses 10 custom inks with varying spectra and a resin-based 3D printer."

All rights reserved.The increasing demand for transportation and the ineffectiveness in financing infrastructure projects contribute to various challenges for Vietnam in the recent decades. Financial investment in infrastructure projects is usually so large that the state budget cannot cover all of it. In order to encounter this challenge, Vietnam has called for the participation of other economic sectors, especially the private sector. Consequently, the government has been cooperating with the private sector in the form of public-private partnership (PPP). The development of PPP projects faces a variety of critical risks; therefore, it is challenging for the government to attract private investors. This paper investigates the problems affecting the performance of PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. We gathered general information and organizational structures of the PPP projects as well as compiled the problems experienced in previous PPP projects through in-depth interviews with PPP experts in Vietnam. Interestingly, there are a large number of critical problems affecting the feasibility stage of PPP projects, including inadequate feasibility studies, changes in the laws and regulations, government intervention, lack of transparency in bidding, unfair process of selection in the private sector, and conflicting or imperfect contracts. In addition, the only one significant success factor in the PPP projects was incentives provided by the government. The results of this study can assist in implementing PPP transportation projects in Vietnam so that the nation can establish public policies that attract both domestic and foreign private investors."
"['Computer Science Applications', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","Single observation adaptive search for continuous simulation optimization  2018 INFORMS.Optimizing the performance of complex systems modeled by stochastic computer simulations is a challenging task, partly because of the lack of structural properties (e.g., convexity). This challenge is magnified by the presence of random error whereby an adaptive algorithm searching for better designs can at times mistakenly accept an inferior design. In contrast to performing multiple simulations at a design point to estimate the performance of the design, we propose a framework for adaptive search algorithms that executes a single simulation for each design point encountered. Here the estimation errors are reduced by averaging the performances from previously evaluated designs drawn from a shrinking ball around the current design point. We show under mild regularity conditions for continuous design spaces that the accumulated errors, although dependent, form a martingale process, and hence, by the strong law of large numbers for martingales, the average errors converge to zero as the algorithm proceeds. This class of algorithms is shown to converge to a global optimum with probability one. By employing a shrinking ball approach with single observations, an adaptive search algorithm can simultaneously improve the estimates of performance while exploring new and potentially better design points. Numerical experiments offer empirical support for this paradigm of single observation simulation optimization."
"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)']","Acute toxicity and teratogenicity of α-mangostin in zebrafish embryos  2019 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. α-Mangostin is the most active compound derived from the pericarps of mangosteen. A number of studies have reported its anticancer activity. However, only a few studies have investigated the toxicity of this compound; moreover, the teratogenicity of α-mangostin has not been reported. In this study, we evaluated the effects of α-mangostin on the development of zebrafish embryos. The exposure of zebrafish embryos to α-mangostin for 72 h dose-dependently induced mortality and abnormal development. The derived LC 50 value of α-mangostin to zebrafish embryos at 72 h was 5.75 ± 0.26 μmol/L. We observed teratogenic effects in α-mangostin-treated embryos, characterized by axis malformation, bent tail, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, sluggish circulation, and heart malformation. The percentages of the malformed embryos were 78.79% and 100% at 4.5 and 6 μM, respectively. α-Mangostin exposure also caused hemostasis in the ducts of Cuvier and a decreased heart rate in zebrafish embryos at 48 and 72 h post-fertilization. These results indicated that α-mangostin induced cardiac dysfunction in zebrafish embryos. In addition, a sub-lethal concentration and a lethal concentration (3 and 6 μM, respectively) were used to assess the compound effects on oxidative stress and embryonic erythropoiesis. α-Mangostin was found to decrease the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, hemoglobin staining revealed a decrease in hemoglobin, which suggested that α-mangostin disrupted embryonic erythropoiesis in zebrafish. To our knowledge, the results of this study, for the first time, demonstrated that α-mangostin was potentially teratogenic and could disrupt embryonic ROS balance and erythropoiesis. Impact statement: α-Mangostin has been reported to have anticancer properties both in vitro and in vivo models. Although there are several studies that evaluated the toxicity of the compound in rodent models, we are the first to evaluate the teratogenicity of α-mangostin. In the present work, we found that α-mangostin induced mortality and malformations in zebrafish embryos. In addition, we exhibited that the compound also disrupted the reactive oxygen species and hemoglobin levels. These findings suggest that α-mangostin may possibly cause the same adverse effects on human health. The mechanisms of these toxicological effects of the compound will be further elucidated and the effects found in zebrafish embryos need to be verified in other animal models."

Epidemiological and experimental studies confirmed an association between outdoor PM and carotid artery intima-media thickness [CIMT], which can potentially lead to progression of CVD. However, evidence on the effects of indoor PM on the CVD system is still limited. Objective: To examine the association of long-term exposure to household indoor PM of less than 10 micrometer [PM 10 ] and increased carotid intima-media thickness [CIMT] of the common carotid artery [CCA]. Materials and Methods: A one-year follow-up study was conducted in 104 households located in the central city of Sakon Nakhon province, Thailand. Clinical testing and a carotid artery ultrasound of participants were undertaken between September 2016 and September 2017. Household PM 10 concentrations, temperature, and relative humidity [RH] were measured inside the participants’ home during the wet and dry seasons. Results: The average of PM 10 concentrations was 24.2±11.2 μg/m 3 . Mean and maximum CIMT at CCA was different between baseline and follow-up (p-value <0.001). Logistics regression models showed that an increase of 1 μg/m 3 average household PM 10 concentrations were associated with 6% increased risk of increased maximum CIMT of CCA (AOR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11). Conclusion: Household PM 10 concentration is associated with increased CIMT of CCA. This finding suggests that household PM 10 may be a risk factor for CVD morbidity and mortality."

The most common causes were antibiotic, blood component, and colloid, in 13, 9, and 6 cases, respectively. Clinical manifestations of grade III were hypotension, rash or urticarial, bronchospasm, tachycardia, and angioedema, in 21, 18, 15, 11, and 5 patients, respectively. Only 19 from 28 patients in grade III received adrenaline treatment. All patients in grade I and II recovered completely. In grade III, surgery was postponed in five cases and two cases were admitted to ICU. Only one patient received serologic test and skin test. Conclusion: To improve outcome, guidelines for perioperative anaphylaxis management should be followed. After anaphylaxis event, proper investigation to identify definite cause should be done at proper time."
['Medicine (all)'],"The result of conservative management for postoperative seroma following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair [lvhr]  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved. Background: Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair [LVHR] with mesh showed lower recurrent rate than suture repair, especially in defect size larger than 2 cm. Postoperative seroma formation was variable. Materials and Methods: A retrospective descriptive review of 110 patients that received LVHR with mesh in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 2007 and December 2013 from collected database and medical records was done. Results: The mean size of ventral hernia defect was 55 cm 2 (range 4 to 300 cm 2 ). Seven to fourteen days after LVHR, the seroma had been detected by clinical diagnosis in 19 patients (17.2%). Conservative management was success in 16 patients (84.2%). The mean size of seroma was 4.5 cm in diameter (range 2 to 10 cm), and the mean conservative time was two months. However, the conservative management failed in three patients (15.8%). Two patients (10.5%) received aspirated seroma at two and six months after conservative. Only one patient (5.3%) had infected seroma, managed by surgical drainage and mesh removal. Conclusion: Almost all patients with postoperative seroma following LVRH were asymptomatic, could be observed safely, and succeeded conservative treatment within two months after operation. However, it might be necessary to perform interventional or surgical treatment if seroma was symptomatic, persisted more than two months, or became infected."

All rights reserved.Background: Lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy are the most common causes of secondary and primary of glomerulonephritis. Periostin is a novel biomarker related to kidney disease progression. Previous studies demonstrated the expression of periostin in both animal and human with different types of kidney disease. Objective: The present cohort study was to examine the level of urine periostin in patients with lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy and to identify the correlation between urine periostin level and other variables. The urine periostin measurement and response to therapy after six months of treatment was also evaluated. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy were included in the present study. Urine sample were collected at the biopsy date. Urine periostin measurement were performed. After six months of treatment, response to therapy was assessed and urine samples were collected. Results: Urine periostin was detected in 23 patients and 11 healthy controls with significant higher level in patients than in controls (33.27 ng/mg versus 2.38 ng/mg, p<0.001). Serum creatinine was significant higher in patients with urine periostin detection (0.9 mg/dl versus 0.7 mg/dl, p<0.05). There was also a correlation between urine periostin level and renal function. In addition, urine periostin level was significant lower after six months of treatment in patients with response to therapy (35.70 ng/mg versus 4.35 ng/mg, p<0.05). Conclusion: The present study’s results supported the potential of periostin as a urinary biomarker of kidney disease progression in patients with lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy."

All rights reserved.Objective: To determine whether shear wave elastography [SWE] can increase specificity in diagnosis of benign and malignant breast masses in BI-RADS category 3 and 4. Materials and Methods: Data were collected retrospectively between January 2013 and December 2015 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Breast sonography with supplementary SWE of BI-RADS category 3 and 4, according to the ACR BI-RADS 2013, which had histopathology-proved diagnosis or at least two years of stability, were randomly reviewed by the researchers. Elasticity values were all generated by Supersonic Imagine ultrasound system. Minimal elasticity [Emin], mean elasticity [Emean], and maximal elasticity [Emax] values were separately evaluated among benign and malignant groups. Results: One hundred sixteen lesions in 107 female patients were eligible for the present study. Eighty lesions (68.9%) were benign and 36 lesions (31.0%) were malignant. All Emin, Emean, and Emax showed statistically significant difference between benign and malignant lesions (p-value 0.022, 0.001, and <0.001, respectively). The area under the receiver operating curve [AUC] for elasticity value was slightly higher for maximum (0.733) than mean (0.710) values. The cut-off value of Emax was 110 kPa, showing sensitivity 63.9%, specificity 78.8%, PPV 57.5%, NPV 82.9%, and accuracy 74.1%. All BI-RADS category 3 lesions were benign, as well as all BI-RADS category 4c lesions, were malignant. The cut-off value of Emax below 48 kPa in BI-RADS category 4a lesions proved to be all benign except medullary carcinoma. Maximal Emax value was 300 kPa, which was proven to be diabetes mellitus mastopathy and some malignant lesions. Conclusion: Emin, Emean, and Emax values were significantly different between benign and malignant masses and the specificity was increased as compared with conventional ultrasound alone, especially in BI-RADS category 4a. The present study showed Emax value at 110 kPa had good specificity and high NPV. Elasticity values primarily reflect the degree of fibrosis of breast lesions, which help the diagnosis."
['Medicine (all)'],"Safety and efficacy of the thai red cross society albumin replacement for therapeutic plasma exchange  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Albumin replacement has been widely used in various conditions. However, there had been problems of rising cost and supply shortage of imported albumin in Thailand. To solve the problem, the National Blood Centre had established a plasma fractionation plant to manufacture plasma products including albumin. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Thai Red Cross Society [TRCS] albumin. Materials and Methods: To minimize confounder effects of underlying conditions, only patients that underwent therapeutic plasma exchange [TPE] using the TRCS albumin replacement from two hospitals were included. Serum albumin levels were measured before and after TPE. The adverse effects were recorded. Results: One hundred fifty-six TPEs in 35 patients were included. The median total plasma volume was 3,000 (range 1,750 to 4,200) mL. Although the corrected calcium level was low (<8 mg/dL) in 3.2% (5/156) before the procedure, no clinical manifestation of hypocalcemia was detected. Adverse effects were observed during the TPE in two patients. The first patient had two events of hypotension. He previously took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The second patient complained of nausea after finishing TPE. The incidence of adverse effects was 1.9% (3/156). As a historical control, the incidence of TPE adverse effects was 1.6% (2/125) when commercial albumin was used in 2014. The difference was not statistically different (p = 1.000). Median serum albumin levels pre-TPE and post-TPE were 3.6 (1.9 to 4.4) and 3.9 (2.4 to 5.0) g/dL, respectively. The increase in serum albumin after TPE was statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusion: The authors demonstrated that the TRCS albumin was safe and effective in maintaining albumin levels in patients undergoing TPEs."

All rights reserved.Objective: To investigate the effects of statistical thresholding and to determine an optimal functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] statistical threshold for Thai language lateralization. Materials and Methods: The present study was prospective descriptive study of twenty Thai native speaker right-handed healthy volunteers performed Thai verb and word generation paradigms during 3T fMRI. Bihemispheric activation difference of language region of interests was calculated for laterality index [LI] through ranks of statistical threshold, from the threshold that generated an empty map to the minimal threshold with p-value less than 0.05. Results: LI of both verb generation and word generation paradigms tended to rise in higher statistical thresholds. In two subjects, shifted of LI from co-dominant to left dominant were found as an effect of statistical thresholding on both paradigms. A threshold (t-value) of 7 in verb generation paradigm and a threshold (t-value) of 6 in word generation paradigm significantly increased mean LI (with p-value 0.004 and 0.003, respectively) and categorized 95% of the subjects as left hemispheric dominance. Conclusion: LI varies across different statistical thresholds. Optimal thresholds (t-value) for language lateralization are 7 in Thai verb generation and 6 in Thai word generation paradigms."
['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"Search for heavy resonances decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson in final states with charged leptons, neutrinos and b quarks at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for heavy resonances, decaying into the standard model vector bosons and the standard model Higgs boson, is presented. The final states considered contain a b quark-antiquark pair from the decay of the Higgs boson, along with electrons and muons and missing transverse momentum, due to undetected neutrinos, from the decay of the vector bosons. The mass spectra are used to search for a localized excess consistent with a resonant particle. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with background expectations. Exclusion limits are set in the context of spin-0 two Higgs doublet models, some of which include the presence of dark matter. In the spin-1 heavy vector triplet framework, mass-degenerate W′ and Z′ resonances with dominant couplings to the standard model gauge bosons are excluded below a mass of 2.9 TeV at 95% confidence level.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
['Orthopedics and Sports Medicine'],"Arthroscopic Synthetic Augmentation in Acute Partial Injury of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament  2018 Arthroscopy Association of North AmericaAcute partial injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a challenging condition without a standard treatment. Although ACL reconstruction provided a better outcome previously, recent studies have shown that preserving the ACL stump yields promising results in terms of better vascularization, proprioception, and ligamentization. ACL augmentation is becoming more popular. Therefore, we propose a technique to augment an acute partial ACL injury with synthetic suture material to stabilize the unstable cruciate ligament. The suture material acts as a structural tie for ACL healing without any need for external immobilization. This technique is beneficial in preserving the natural ACL stump and autograft, creating a narrow bone tunnel, and providing a good cosmetic outcome."

The analysis is based on data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV during the 2016 LHC running period, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Allowing the Higgs mass to float, the measurement yields a signal strength relative to the standard model prediction of 1.18− 0.14 + 0.17 = 1.18− 0.11 + 0.12(stat)− 0.07 + 0.09(syst)− 0.06 + 0.07(theo), which is largely insensitive to the exact Higgs mass around 125 GeV. Signal strengths associated with the different Higgs boson production mechanisms, couplings to bosons and fermions, and effective couplings to photons and gluons are also measured.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Environmental Science (all)']","Forecast of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Energy Consumption in Industry Sectors in Thailand  2018 Pruethsan Sutthichaimethee, Danupon Ariyasajjakorn.The aim of this research is to forecast CO2emissions from consumption of energy in Industry sectors in Thailand. To study, input-output tables based on Thailand for the years 2000 to 2015 are deployed to estimate CO2emissions, population growth and GDP growth. Moreover, those are also used to anticipate the energy consumption for fifteen years and thirty years ahead. The ARIMAX Model is applied to two sub-models, and the result indicates that Thailand will have 14.3541 % on average higher in CO2emissions in a fifteen-year period (2016-2030), and 31.1536 % in a thirty-year period (2016-2045). This study hopes to be useful in shaping future national policies and more effective planning. The researcher uses a statistical model called the ARIMAX Model, which is a stationary data model, and is a model that eliminates the problems of autocorrelations, heteroskedasticity, and multicollinearity. Thus, the forecasts will be made with minor error."
['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"Search for resonances in the mass spectrum of muon pairs produced in association with b quark jets in proton-proton collisions at √s=8 and 13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for resonances in the mass range 12–70 GeV produced in association with a b quark jet and a second jet, and decaying to a muon pair, is reported. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and 35.9 fb−1, respectively. The search is carried out in two mutually exclusive event categories. Events in the first category are required to have a b quark jet in the central region (|η| ≤ 2.4) and at least one jet in the forward region (|η| > 2.4). Events in the second category are required to have two jets in the central region, at least one of which is identified as a b quark jet, no jets in the forward region, and low missing transverse momentum. An excess of events above the background near a dimuon mass of 28 GeV is observed in the 8 TeV data, corresponding to local significances of 4.2 and 2.9 standard deviations for the first and second event categories, respectively. A similar analysis conducted with the 13 TeV data results in a mild excess over the background in the first event category corresponding to a local significance of 2.0 standard deviations, while the second category results in a 1.4 standard deviation deficit. The fiducial cross section measurements and 95% confidence level upper limits on those for a resonance consistent with the 8 TeV excess are provided at both collision energies.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"['Microbiology', 'Virology']","Protein kinase a and high-osmolarity glycerol response pathways cooperatively control cell wall carbohydrate mobilization in aspergillus fumigatus  2018 de Assis et al.Aspergillus fumigatus mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in maintaining the normal morphology of the cell wall and providing resistance against cell wall-damaging agents. Upon cell wall stress, cell wall-related sugars need to be synthesized from carbohydrate storage compounds. Here we show that this process is dependent on cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity and regulated by the high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) MAPKs SakA and MpkC. These protein kinases are necessary for normal accumulation/degradation of trehalose and glycogen, and the lack of these genes reduces glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Alterations in glycogen synthesis were observed for the sakA and mpkC deletion mutants, which also displayed alterations in carbohydrate exposure on the cell wall. Carbohydrate mobilization is controlled by SakA interaction with PkaC1 and PkaR, suggesting a putative mechanism where the PkaR regulatory subunit leaves the complex and releases the SakA-PkaC1 complex for activation of enzymes involved in carbohydrate mobilization. This work reveals the communication between the HOG and PKA pathways for carbohydrate mobilization for cell wall construction. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic human pathogen causing allergic reactions or systemic infections such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, especially in immunocompromised patients. The fungal cell wall is the main component responsible for recognition by the immune system, due to the specific composition of polysaccharide carbohydrates exposed on the surface of the fungal cell wall called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Key enzymes in the fungal cell wall biosynthesis are a good target for fungal drug development. This report elucidates the cooperation between the HOG and PKA pathways in the mobilization of carbohydrates for fungal cell wall biosynthesis. We suggest that the reduced mobilization of simple sugars causes defects in the structure of the fungal cell wall. In summary, we propose that SakA is important for PKA activity, therefore regulating the availability and mobilization of monosaccharides for fungal cell wall biosynthesis during cell wall damage and the osmotic stress response."
"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)']","α-Mangostin and apigenin induced the necrotic death of BT474 breast cancer cells with autophagy and inflammation  2018 by the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine. Objective: To find new compounds in order to overcome the mainstay of metastatic breast cancer due to the adverse side effects from, and increasing resistance to, current chemotherapeutic agents. Methods: α-Mangostin and apigenin were reported in comparison to doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug. Ductal carcinoma (BT474) cell line and non-tumorigenic epithelial tissue from mammary gland (MCF-10A) were used. Cell viability assessment was calculated by the standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. Cell morphology was investigated by light microscopy. By flow cytometry analysis, programmed cell death was observed using annexin V and propidium iodide staining while cell-cycle arrest was observed using propidium iodide staining. Change in transcriptional expression was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results: In 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the result revealed α-mangostin and apigenin were more cytotoxic to BT474 cells. Longer exposure times to α-mangostin and apigenin caused more floating cells and a lower density of adhered cells with more vacuoles present in the colonies in BT474 only. α-Mangostin and apigenin caused necrosis in BT474 cells in a 24 h exposure, but a small amount of early apoptotic cells could also be detected at 24, 48 and 72 h exposure, whereas doxorubicin caused early apoptosis to BT474 cells at 24 h. Transcript expression and activity analysis supported caspase-3 was involved in the death of BT474 cells treated by all compounds. Moreover, α-mangostin and apigenin arrested the cell-cycle at the G 1 -phase, but at the G 2 /M-phase by doxorubicin. All three compounds induced a change in transcript expression levels of inflammation-associated, proto-oncogene, autophagy-associated and apoptosis-associated genes. Conclusions: α-Mangostin and apigenin are worth investigating as potential new sources of chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment."
