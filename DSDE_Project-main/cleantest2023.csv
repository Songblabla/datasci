The hydrogel-based sensor was formed by Ca2+ cations cross-linked PV/Cu2+-GO/Alg. The morphologies of hydrogel were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy. Incorporating GO into the hydrogel improved its uniformity of porosity, large surface area, and compressive strength, leading to amplified colorimetric signals of the hydrogel sensor. Under optimal conditions, this sensor offered a linear range of 0.0–0.5 g/L with a detection limit of 0.05 g/L for cysteine without interfering effects in urine. Furthermore, this hydrogel-based sensor was applied for urinary cysteine detection and validated with laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. This platform could be used to determine cysteine at its cutoff (0.25 g/L) in human urine, which was distinguishable between normal and abnormal individuals, to evaluate an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Eventually, this system was integrated with diapers for a wearable cysteine sensor."

Synthesis and crystallization of the complex has been achieved at ambient conditions using methanol-water (4:1 v/v) as a solvent mixture after very slow evaporation. Furthermore, the complex is characterized by elemental analyses, spectroscopic methods (UV–Visible, FT-IR) and structure elucidation has been carried out by single crystal X-ray structure analyses. X-ray structure determination of the complex revealed the presence of [Cu(H3tea)2]2+ as a cation and two moieties of 3,4-dimethoxycinnamate as anions forming a second sphere coordination complex. Various weak (non-covalent) interactions such as C–H∙∙∙O, and O–H∙∙∙O impart an important role in the lattice stabilization of a second sphere coordination complex. Hirshfeld surface calculations clearly revealed the existence of interplay of non-covalent interactions in lattice stabilization. The theoretical calculation also suggested the total interaction energies in this complex, i.e. 32.6 kj.mol−1. In addition, molecular docking investigations of this complex clearly showed that there is substantial protein-ligand interaction with best binding scores of -7.2, -7.3, -7.9 kcal/mol against 4GKU, 3W4P, 5CGX and -5.8, -7.8 kcal/mol against 4HFZ, 1D5R proteins lesser than parent acid i.e. 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid indicating the potential of this complex; [Cu(H3tea)2](3,4-DMC)2·2H2O as antibacterial and anticancer agent respectively."
['Aquatic Science'],"Total ammonia nitrogen removal and microbial community dynamics in an outdoor HDPE-lined shrimp pond with no water discharge  2023 Elsevier B.V.This study assessed the characteristics of a zero-discharge outdoor high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-lined demonstration aquaculture pond (400 m2) in terms of water quality variables, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal and oxygen net primary production (NPP) indices, and photosynthetic microbiome over a 76-day crop cycle. The shrimp harvest yield was 4.1 t/ha/crop with an average daily gain (ADG) of 0.15 g/day and a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1.49. During shrimp cultivation with a semi-intensive stocking density (40 shrimp/m2), there were low levels of TAN (<1.01 mg-N/L), nitrite (<0.21 mg-N/L), and nitrate (<2.79 mg-N/L). Ammonia removal was mainly mediated by photoautotrophic uptake, as evidenced by the consistent estimated TAN uptake rate of 0.05 ± 0.02 g-N/m3 h, which was calculated based on photosynthesis. The overall TAN removal rate of 0.10 ± 0.08 g-N/m3 h was maintained by suspended microorganisms in water, which exceeded that of microorganisms attached to the HDPE liner surface. A positive oxygen NPP of 0.24–1.16 g-O2/m3 h during light availability indicated prevailing autotrophic conditions. The bacterial community in the water was dominated by Phyla Pseudomonadota (Proteobacteria; 16–32%), Bacteroidota (Bacteroidetes; 15–29%), Cyanobacteria (7–35%), and Actinomycetota (Actinobacteria; 3–39%). The chloroplast amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) indicated abundances of Bacillariophyta (27–97%) and Chlorophyta (0.4–67%). High centric diatom populations (Bacillariophyta) were detected throughout cultivation, while the proportion of green algae (Chlorophyta) was positively correlated with increased TAN availability when feeding was increased. The findings enabled estimations of TAN removal and oxygen NPP rates and provided an understanding of correlations between environmental variables and bacterial and phytoplankton populations in the outdoor lined shrimp pond."

Three different membrane bioreactor systems — R1: AnBB-MBR (without microaeration); R2: AnBB-MBR with microaeration; and R3: AnBB-MBR with integrated microaeration and sludge recirculation — were operated in parallel at the same hydraulic retention time of 20 h and sludge retention time of 100 d. The microaeration promoted greater microbial richness and diversity, which could significantly enhance the removal of acetic acid and dissolved methane in the R2 and R3 systems. Moreover, the partial nitrification and the ability of anammox (Candidatus Brocadia) to thrive in R2 enabled NH4+-N removal to be enhanced by up to 57.8 %. The worst membrane fouling was found in R1 due to high amount of protein as well as fine particles (0.5–5.0 μm) acting as foulants that contributed to pore blocking. While the integration of sludge recirculation with microaeration in R3 was able to improve the membrane permeate flux slightly as compared to R2. Therefore, the AnBB-MBR integrated with a microaeration system (R2) can be considered as promising technology for building wastewater treatment when considering VFA and nutrient removal and an energy-saving approach with low aeration intensity."

However, no clear evidence exists concerning antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) opportunistic pathogens that cause wound infections and pyoderma in canines and zoonotic disease. Aim of the study: The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of P. betle extract were assessed against S. pseudintermedius and MRSP strains. Materials and methods: Ethanol leaf extract of P. betle was investigated for its antibacterial effect on S. pseudintermedius and MRSP by broth microdilution and time-kill assays. Biofilm inhibition and production assays were performed to evaluate antibiofilm and biofilm eradication effects, respectively. Biofilm-associated gene expression was further studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The possible interaction between IcaA and major compounds in P. betle was analyzed by molecular docking. Results: The extract showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 250 μg/mL. Growth inhibition of P. betle at 1 MIC against the bacteria was initially observed after treatment for 4 h. All isolates were completely killed after 18 h exposure to the extract. Minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs) of the extract against the tested isolates ranged 1/2 MIC to 1 MIC, while minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of P. betle was initialed at 8 MIC. Quantitative inhibition and eradication effects were observed in representative strains. The extract at 1/2 MIC and 1 MIC values inhibited biofilm formation up to 100%, with bacterial biofilm removed at up to 94.21% by 4 MIC of the extract. The extract downregulated the expression of the icaA gene among biofilm-producing isolates. The most abundant compounds, 4-allyl-1,2-diacetoxybenzene and eugenol showed a strong affinity with IcaA protein at −5.65 and −5.31 kcal/mol, respectively. Conclusions: P. betle extract demonstrated the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and biofilm-removal activity against S. pseudintermedius and MRSP. Downregulation of the icaA gene expression and protein interaction were possible modes of action of the extract that impacted biofilm production. This extract showed promise as an alternative treatment for S. pseudintermedius infection, especially drug-resistant and biofilm-associated cases."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Rice straw-derived smoke water promotes rice root growth under phosphorus deficiency by modulating oxidative stress and photosynthetic gene expression  2023, Springer Nature Limited.Plant-derived smoke has been shown to promote plant growth and seed germination, but its roles and mechanisms in response to nutrient deficiency stress remain unclear. Plants respond to phosphorus (P) deficiency by undergoing morphological, physiological, and transcriptional changes in order to improve nutrient uptake efficiency. Here, we showed that rice straw-derived smoke water could promote root growth in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) grown under P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions. Transcriptome analysis of the root tissues identified 1309 genes up-regulated and 1311 genes down-regulated by smoke water under P-deficient conditions. The GO terms ‘glutathione transferase activity’ and ‘photosynthesis—light reaction’ were found to be significantly enriched among the genes that were up- and down-regulated by smoke water, respectively. Biochemical analysis showed that smoke water reduced P-deficient-induced accumulation of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation marker, reduced sucrose contents, but increased Fe accumulation. Furthermore, smoke water suppressed the expression of strigolactone biosynthesis genes, which were strongly induced by P deficiency as an adaptive strategy to improve root P uptake. These results revealed a potential mechanism by which smoke water promotes root growth and interacts with P deficiency-induced transcriptional regulation to mitigate P deficiency stress in rice."

In the assay, downscaled extraction was performed in microcentrifuge tubes, utilizing 0.5 mL of chloroform per sample. Instead of spectrophotometric measurements, the extracts were photographed while contained in the closed tubes using a smartphone camera, with white LED serving as the light source. The Red-Green-Blue (RGB) intensities were read out from the image using an RGB Color Detector application. It was found that B/(R + G + B) showed a good linear relationship to the drug concentration over the range of 11.9–118.5 μg/mL (R2 = 0.9992). The method was accurate (% recovery of 99.98–100.91%), precise (% relative standard deviation of 0.97–1.17%), sensitive (LOD = 3.9 μg/mL and LOQ = 11.8 μg/mL), specific and robust. Furthermore, the analysis results obtained were consistent with those obtained through the USP method. The method became greener and safer due to a 20-fold reduction in chloroform consumption and the use of a closed system for signal measurement which prevented the release of solvent vapor into the environment and minimized the analyst's exposure to chemicals. In addition, the method was green with the AGREE score of 0.74, and 9 green shaded sections in the GAPI assessment. Moreover, the data analysis tool in the mobile application developed in this work facilitated rapid and instantaneous calculations of the results. Hence, the assay is feasible for quality control analysis, and helps promote sustainability."
"['Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)']","Targeted sequencing analysis pipeline for species identification of human pathogenic fungi using long-read nanopore sequencing  2023, International Mycological Association.Among molecular-based techniques for fungal identification, Sanger sequencing of the primary universal fungal DNA barcode, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2), is commonly used in clinical routine laboratories due to its simplicity, universality, efficacy, and affordability for fungal species identification. However, Sanger sequencing fails to identify mixed ITS sequences in the case of mixed infections. To overcome this limitation, different high-throughput sequencing technologies have been explored. The nanopore-based technology is now one of the most promising long-read sequencing technologies on the market as it has the potential to sequence the full-length ITS region in a single read. In this study, we established a workflow for species identification using the sequences of the entire ITS region generated by nanopore sequencing of both pure yeast isolates and mocked mixed species reads generated with different scenarios. The species used in this study included Candida albicans (n = 2), Candida tropicalis (n = 1), Nakaseomyces glabratus (formerly Candida glabrata) (n = 1), Trichosporon asahii (n = 2), Pichia kudriavzevii (formerly Candida krusei) (n = 1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 1). Comparing various methods to generate the consensus sequence for fungal species identification, the results from this study indicate that read clustering using a modified version of the NanoCLUST pipeline is more sensitive than Canu or VSEARCH, as it classified species accurately with a lower abundance cluster of reads (3% abundance compared to 10% with VSEARCH). The modified NanoCLUST also reduced the number of classified clusters compared to VSEARCH, making the subsequent BLAST+ analysis faster. Subsampling of the datasets, which reduces the size of the datasets by approximately tenfold, did not significantly affect the identification results in terms of the identified species name, percent identity, query coverage, percentage of reads in the classified cluster, and the number of clusters. The ability of the method to distinguish mixed species within sub-populations of large datasets has the potential to aid computer analysis by reducing the required processing power. The herein presented new sequence analysis pipeline will facilitate better interpretation of fungal sequence data for species identification."

A total of 250,979 tweets and 44,560 replies by 113 DMOs before and during the pandemic were carefully examined using descriptive and time series analyses, topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and principal component analysis. The findings revealed four change patterns in Twitter usage: degrade, disseminate, engage, and elevate. Topic modelling identified 19 content topics and their five trends during the pandemic: falling, rebounding, maintaining, relapsing, and rising. Additionally, the four general content strategies — emotional, functional, informational, and experiential — provided a guideline and competitive landscape for DMOs to use in planning and devising their marketing communication strategies to handle such a shock. This study effectively addresses several research gaps, including the dearth of longitudinal, cross-country, and supply-side studies on crisis communications in tourism. As such, it enriches the existing body of knowledge by taking a comprehensive look at the diverse communication executions and strategies during both regular periods and crises. In doing so, it bridges the gap between theories of crisis communications and general social media communication strategies employed by DMOs."

Materials and Methods: Hydroxyapatite was synthesized with and without tricalcium phosphate under uniaxial pressing of 10 and 17 MPa (HA10, HA17, BCP10, and BCP17), followed by sintering at 1250 °C for 2 h. Human enamel and dentin blocks were used as control groups. The mechanical properties were determined by compressive strength test and Vickers microhardness. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and LSD post-hoc test (α = 0.05). The phase formation and morphology of the specimens were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: HA17 and HA10 had compressive strength values comparable to enamel and dentin, respectively (p > 0.05). The microhardness of all synthesized groups was significantly higher than that of tooth structures (p < 0.05). From the XRD graphs, only the hydroxyapatite peak was observed in the control and HA groups. SEM images showed homogeneous hydroxyapatite grains in all groups, while the BCP groups contained higher porosities. Conclusions: Both HA10 and HA17 are suitable for use as the inorganic part of dentin and enamel substitutes."

This leads to the difficulty of delivery in animal body system as well as the feed pelleting process. The present work proposes the microcapsule networks based on polymer matrices and charges under ionic crosslink to encapsulate probiotic for an extensive stability in adverse conditions. The combination of agar (AG) and alginate (AL) is a good model to combine agar matrices and alginate charges under ionic crosslink through o/w emulsion system for probiotic incorporation. By simply mixing Lactobacillus plantarum MB001(LPMB001) with AL and AG containing few drops of soybean oil, a stable o/w microemulsion can be obtained. The addition of calcium chloride favors the ionic crosslink among AG matrices resulting in LPMB001/AG-AL microcapsules. In vitro studies indicate the survival of LPMB001 and the slow release even after treatment in adverse conditions. This microencapsulation prolongs LPMB001 viability under the heat treatment and the storage conditions and this designates the potential feed processing. The present work for the first time shows how we can combine polymer matrices and charges to protect probiotic from the adverse conditions which is simple and practical for the process of dietary supplementation."

['Multidisciplinary'],"Deciphering migraine pain mechanisms through electrophysiological insights of trigeminal ganglion neurons  2023, Springer Nature Limited.Migraine is a complex neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite extensive research, the underlying mechanisms that drive migraine pain and related abnormal sensation symptoms, such as hyperalgesia, allodynia, hyperesthesia, and paresthesia, remain poorly understood. One of the proposed mechanisms is cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is believed to be involved in the regulation of trigeminovascular pathways by sensitizing the pain pathway. Another mechanism is serotonin depletion, which is implicated in many neurological disorders and has been shown to exacerbate CSD-evoked pain at the cortical level. However, the effects of CSD and serotonin depletion on trigeminal ganglion neurons, which play a critical role in pain signal transmission, have not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between CSD and serotonin depletion with peripheral sensitization processes in nociceptive small-to-medium (SM) and large (L) -sized trigeminal ganglion neurons at the electrophysiological level using rat models. We divided the rats into four groups: the control group, the CSD group, the serotonin depletion group, and the CSD/serotonin depletion group. We induced CSD by placing KCl on a burr hole and serotonin depletion by intraperitoneal injection of PCPA (para-chlorophenoxyacetic acid). We then isolated trigeminal ganglion neurons from all groups and classified them according to size. Using patch-clamp recording, we recorded the excitability parameters and action potential (AP) properties of the collected neurons. Our results showed that in SM-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons, the CSD-SM and CSD/serotonin depletion groups had a higher positive resting membrane potential (RMP) than the control-SM group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively, post-hoc Tukey’s test). In addition, the gap between RMP and threshold in the CSD-SM group was significantly narrower than in the control-SM group (p = 0.043, post-hoc Tukey’s test). For L-sized neurons, we observed prolongation of the AP rising time, AP falling time, and AP duration in neurons affected by CSD (p < 0.05, pairwise comparison test). In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of migraine pain and abnormal somatosensation. CSD and serotonin depletion promote the transmission of pain signals through the peripheral sensitization process of nociceptive small-to-medium-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons, as well as nociceptive and non-nociceptive large-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons."

A longitudinal study of 50 patients with HCV monoinfection and 19 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection received DAAs were conducted. Fecal specimens collected at baseline and at week 72 after treatment completion (FUw72) were analyzed for 16S rRNA sequencing and the butyryl-CoA:acetateCoA transferase (BCoAT) gene expression using real-time PCR. Plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) were quantified by ELISA assays. SVR rates in mono- and coinfected patients were comparable (94% vs. 100%). The improvement of gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation was found in responders but was not in non-responders. Among responders, significant restoration of alpha-diversity, BCoAT and LBP were observed in HCV patients with low-grade fibrosis (F0–F1), while HCV/HIV patients exhibited partial improvement at FUw72. I-FABP did not decline significantly in responders. Treatment induced microbiota changes with increasing abundance of SCFAs-producing bacteria, including Blautia, Fusicatenibacter, Subdoligranulum and Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, long-term effect of DAAs impacted the restoration of gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. However, early initiation of DAAs required for an alteration of gut microbiota, enhanced SCFAs-producing bacteria, and could reduce HCV-related complications."

The W-I method based on the synthesis of M-TiO2 powders (DP25 decorated with metal) followed by the sono-deposition on PET sheets. The W-II method begins with the sono-deposition of DP25 onto PET sheets, followed by the sono-deposition of M-TiO2 solution (DP25 +Metal+H2O). Under visible light, the Cu-DP25/PET and Au-DP25/PET films via W-II exhibited superior photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity was studied by analyzing the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light. The materials were characterized with the employing of scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–vis DRS (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL). The interactions between catalysts/environment were studied through molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and binding energies (Ebinding). The superior photodegradation of Au-DP25/PET films towards MB was attributed to the combination of two effects: LSPR (localized surface plasmon resonance) and Au-TiO2/environment affinities. The aim of the experimental/theoretical analysis was to provide a deep understanding of the medium/surface interactions on decorated TiO2 materials and how these interactions influence the overall degradation behavior."

However, our understanding of sulfur metabolism in fruit remains limited. In this study, we focused on the functional characterization of durian methionine γ-lyase (DzMGL), the key enzyme in volatile sulfur compound (VSC) production. In addition, to gain a better insight into sulfur metabolism, we profiled metabolites related to this process using various methods and assessed the expression of relevant genes through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Our gene and metabolite analyses revealed that sulfur metabolism is activated during ripening. Interestingly, DzMGL exhibited a higher efficiency in using L-cysteine than Arabidopsis MGL. The differential levels of the produced VSCs explained the aroma intensity-related differences between the two commercial Thai cultivars ‘Chanee’ and ‘Monthong’. Furthermore, the cysteine availability-related differences between the two cultivars could contribute to this variation, with ‘Chanee’ containing higher cysteine levels than ‘Monthong’. Our findings indicated that γ-glutamylcysteine was the preferred form of sulfur storage in durian pulps, with a potential recycling process providing intermediates that flux methionine toward ethylene biosynthesis and VSC production. This study provides novel insights into sulfur metabolism in durian fruit."

Four compounds were synthesised, namely 501, 502, 503, and 506. AA was used as the control. The 502 exhibited low water solubility, while the 506 compound showed the highest. The cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that 503 caused significant deterioration in cell viability, while other derivatives showed no harmful effect on hPDLSCs. The dimethyl aminopropyl amine derivative of AA, compound 506, demonstrated a relatively high potency in inducing osteogenic differentiation. An elevated mRNA expression of osteogenic-related genes, BMP2, WNT3A, ALP, OSX and IBSP was observed with 506. Additionally, the expression of BMP-2 protein was enhanced with increasing dose of 506, and the effect was pronounced when the Erk signalling molecule was inhibited. The 506 derivative was proposed for the promotion of osteogenic differentiation in hPDLSCs by upregulating BMP2 via the Erk signalling pathway. The 506 molecule showed promise in bone tissue regeneration."
['Multidisciplinary'],"A novel simplified method for extraction of microplastic particles from face scrub and laundry wastewater  2023, Springer Nature Limited.Microplastic pollution in different environmental matrices is a serious concern in the recent times. Personal care products and washing of synthetic fabrics are some of the main sources of microplastic pollution. In this work, a novel simplified, effective and sustainable method for extraction of microplastic particles from face scrub and laundry wastewater was developed. Different parameters affecting the extraction were analysed and the extraction process was optimised. The extraction efficiency of the proposed method was found to be ~ 94.1 ± 1.65%, which was slightly better than the previously available method with an advantage of ease in extraction and lesser time and resource consuming. The developed method was used to demonstrate the extraction of microplastic particles from 12 face scrub samples with different brands. It was found that the samples contained microplastic particles of varying size. The physical and chemical structure intactness of microplastic particles during the extraction was also analysed and found to be acceptable. The developed extraction method was also applied for the extraction of microfibers from the laundry wastewater. It was found that this proposed method is suitable to make the cleaner extracted samples for an easy and more effective qualitative and quantitative analysis of MPs."

Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) was the first antibody to target immune checkpoint PD-L1 and is now among the most commonly used anticancer therapies. However, this anti-PD-L1 antibody is produced in mammalian cells with high manufacturing costs, limiting cancer patients’ access to the antibody treatment. Plant expression system is another platform that can be utilized, as they can synthesize complex glycoproteins, are rapidly scalable, and relatively cost-efficient. Herein, Atezolizumab was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana and demonstrated high expression level within 4–6 days post-infiltration. After purification by affinity chromatography, the purified plant-produced Atezolizumab was compared to Tecentriq and showed the absence of glycosylation. Furthermore, the plant-produced Atezolizumab could bind to PD-L1 with comparable affinity to Tecentriq in ELISA. The tumor growth inhibitory activity of plant-produced Atezolizumab in mice was also found to be similar to that of Tecentriq. These findings confirm the plant’s capability to serve as an efficient production platform for immunotherapeutic antibodies and suggest that it could be used to alleviate the cost of existing anticancer products."

The adsorption has been investigated through molecular simulations. Simulation results and theoretical considerations show that reasons for the extraordinarily high selectivity in all four cases were found to be the differences in the enthalpy of adsorption for the various adsorbed gases rather than steric reasons. The four adsorbate–adsorbent systems have been examined at different temperatures, pressures, and concentration ratios in the mixture. Among them, the carbon nanotube CNT (11,11) exhibited the highest selectivity, reaching up to 104."

However, most validation experiments included only homogeneous cell lines and inadequately captured the broad morphological heterogeneity of cancer cells. Furthermore, normal, non-blood cells could be erroneously classified as cancer because their morphology differ from blood cells. Here, we constructed a dataset of microscopic images of organoid-derived cancer and normal cell with diverse morphology and developed a proof-of-concept deep learning model that can distinguish cancer cells from normal cells within an unlabeled microscopy image. In total, more than 75,000 organoid-drived cells from 3 cholangiocarcinoma patients were collected. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.78 and can generalize to cell images from an unseen patient. These resources serve as a foundation for an automated, robust platform for circulating tumor cell detection."

However, it remains unresolved whether having oral hypofunction and each individual condition adversely affect general health. This study aimed to investigate the association between oral hypofunction and general health, encompassing physical, psychological, and social dimensions. Methods: Oral hypofunction was diagnosed following the criteria proposed by the 2016 Japan Society of Gerodontology, comprising 7 oral function conditions. Oral hypofunction was diagnosed when at least 3 conditions presented. The selected studies eligible for reviewing were based on the PI(E)CO criteria: P (population), adult and older adults; I/E (intervention/exposure), having oral hypofunction by considering overall and individual 7 oral function conditions; C (comparator), not having oral hypofunction; O (outcome), the general health status, encompassing physical, psychological, and social dimensions. Electronic search limited to English articles was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases from January 2016 to June 2023. The included studies were assessed for quaility and risk of bias using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Qualitative analyses were performed on the general outcome, and having oral hypofunction considering overall and individual oral function conditions. Results: Ten studies were included in the final syntheses. One was a prospective cohort, one was a case-control, and the others were cross-sectional studies. All included studies were high quality. General health outcomes were mostly frailty, sarcopenia, and malnutrition, whereas mild cognitive impairment,social withdrawal, and gastric cancer prognosis were identified in one of the included studies. The association between general health and having oral hypofunction was stronger than when considering an individual condition. The health outcomes were predominantly associated with mastication and swallowing, whereas their relationships with oral hygiene and dryness were less likely to be reported. Conclusions: The present review found an association between the presence of oral hypofunction and impaired general health. However, the specific impact on individual physical, psychological, and social dimensions cannot be distinctly delineated. Further prospective studies are required to clarify the causal-effect relationship between oral and general health."

Asiatic acid (AA), an active compound in Centella asiatica L, exhibit neuroprotective properties in previous studies. Due to its low bioavailability, the nose-to-brain delivery technique was used to enhance AA penetration in the brain. In this study, AA was also loaded in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as a strategy to increase its absorption in the nasal cavity. Methods: Memory impairment was induced via direct intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 oligomer into mouse brain. The neuroprotective effect and potential underlying mechanisms were investigated using several memory behavioral examinations and molecular techniques. Results: The intranasal administration of AA in SLNs attenuated learning and memory impairment induced by Aβ1-42 in Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. AA significantly inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation of pTau-S396 and pTau-T231 and prevented astrocyte reactivity and microglial activation in the hippocampus of Aβ1-42-treated mice. It is also decreased the high levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mouse brain. Conclusions: These results suggested that nose-to-brain delivery of AA in SLNs could be a promising strategy to treat the early stage of AD."

The conditions (ambient temperature occurred in an exothermic reaction, drying time, yield, and solubility) of the reaction between the bio-green CaCO3 and three different acetic (CH3COOH) concentrations (8, 10, and 12 M) were investigated. The product's maximum yield (93%) with a shorter drying time (18 h) was obtained from the reaction between the bio-green CaCO3 with 12 M acetic acid revealing a lower cost. The chemical compositions without any toxic metal impurity revealed by the X-ray fluorescence technique would be useful to suggest use in the specific application. The X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared, and Thermogravimetric analysis data of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O prepared by the bio-green CaCO3 obtained from oyster shell wastes in this work and those in previous works used other calcium sources were consistent. The morphologies with different sizes of the obtained Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O depend on the CH3COOH concentrations reported in this work and were different from those reported in previous works because of different calcium sources. According to the observation, it can be concluded that the low-cost and bio-green technique without the environmental effects was successfully applied to produce cheap Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which can be used in the specific industry."

Evidence is rapidly growing for the impact of myocardial scar identified by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) on cardiovascular events. We aim to assess the prognostic value of LGE on long-term arrhythmic and mortality outcomes in patients with NIDCM. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to January 21, 2022. Studies that included disease-specific subpopulations of NIDCM were excluded. Data were independently extracted and combined via random-effects meta-analysis using a generic inverse-variance strategy. Data from 60 studies comprising 15,217 patients were analyzed with a 3-year median follow-up. The presence of LGE was associated with major ventricular arrhythmic events (pooled OR: 3.99; 95% CI 3.08, 5.16), all-cause mortality (pooled OR: 2.14; 95% CI 1.81, 2.52), cardiovascular mortality (pooled OR 2.83; 95% CI 2.23, 3.60), and heart failure hospitalization (pooled OR: 2.53; 95% CI 1.78, 3.59). Real-world evidence suggests that the presence of LGE on CMR was a strong predictor of adverse long-term outcomes in patients with NIDCM. Scar assessment should be incorporated as a primary determinant in the patient selection criteria for primary prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement."

This study aimed to investigate (1) the effects of pimobendan on cardiac function, cardiac mitochondrial quality and morphology, and cardiac ultrastructure in a rat model of chronic MR and (2) the direct effect of pimobendan on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cardiac cells. MR was surgically induced in 20 Sprague-Dawley rats, and sham procedures were performed on 10 rats. Eight weeks post-surgery, the MR rats were randomly divided into two groups: the MR group and the MR + pimobendan group. Pimobendan (0.15 mg/kg) was administered twice a day via oral gavage for 4 weeks, whereas the sham and MR groups received equivalent volumes of drinking water. Echocardiography was performed at baseline (8 weeks post-surgery) and at the end of the study (4 weeks after treatment). At the end of the study protocol, all rats were euthanized, and their hearts were immediately collected, weighed, and used for transmission electron microscopy and mitochondrial quality assessments. To evaluate the role of pimobendan on intracellular ROS production, preventive or scavenging properties were tested with H2O2-induced ROS generation in rat cardiac myoblasts (H9c2). Results: Pimobendan preserved cardiac functions and structure in MR rats. In addition, pimobendan significantly improved mitochondrial quality by attenuating ROS production and depolarization (P < 0.05). The cardiac ultrastructure and mitochondrial morphology were significantly preserved in the MR + pimobendan group. In addition, pimobendan appeared to play as a ROS scavenger, but not as a ROS preventer, in H2O2-induced ROS production in H9c2 cells. Conclusions: Pimobendan demonstrated cardioprotective effects on cardiac function and ultrastructure by preserving mitochondrial quality and acted as an ROS scavenger in a rat model of MR."

The role of cytokines and chemokines in the pathogenesis, progression of the disease, and histopathologic features is not fully elucidated. To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective study examining the associations between 42 serum biomarkers, histopathologic findings, and clinical outcomes in SJS/TEN patients. We reviewed the medical records of 23 patients diagnosed with SJS/TEN. Regarding histopathology, our study did not reveal any significant associations between the degree of epidermal necrosis, dermal mononuclear cell infiltration, and clinical outcomes. However, an intriguing observation was made regarding the degree of dermal infiltration of CD8 + cells, which showed a negative correlation with the severity of acute ocular complications. Notably, serum levels of IFN-γ positively correlated with the number of CD8 + cells in dermal infiltration. Additionally, higher serum levels of myeloperoxidase were associated with greater degrees of epidermal necrosis, while serum Fas ligand and stem cell factor levels were elevated in individuals with increased dermal mononuclear cell infiltration. Furthermore, the levels of S100A8/A9 were significantly correlated with the SCORTEN and mortality rate. These findings provide insights into the intricate pathogenesis of the disease."

This paper considers the probabilistic analysis of basal heave stability of supported excavations with spatially random soils by employing the random adaptive finite element limit analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to simulate all possible outcomes under parametric uncertainty. The effect of soil strength variability is investigated for various parameters, including the width and depth of the excavation ratio, strength gradient factor, and vertical correlation length. Probabilistic basal stability results have also been employed to determine the probability of design failure for a practical range of deterministic factors of safety. Considering probabilistic failure analysis, the more complete failure patterns caused by the various vertical correlation length would decrease the probability of design failure. There are different tendencies between the probability of design failure at the same safety factor with various vertical correlation lengths. These results can be of great interest to engineering practitioners in the design process of excavation problems."

Pers. 1797) using rubber and bamboo sawdust substrates in tropical regions  2023, Springer Nature Limited.Yamabushitake (Hericium erinaceus) is one of the most sought out mushrooms that is widely used for both direct consumption and medicinal purposes. While its demand increases worldwide, cultivation of the mushroom is limited to temperate areas and its production in tropical regions has never been explored. The aim of this study was to test the utilization of rubber and bamboo sawdust, alone or as a substrate mixture, for industrial scale Yamabushitake mushroom production. Five substrate treatments with various ratios of the two sawdust were compared for their physicochemical properties in relation to mushroom productivity. The highest mushroom fresh and dry (113.22 and 23.25 g, respectively), biological efficiency (42.61%), and cap size (9.53 cm) were obtained from the substrates containing 100% rubber sawdust, with the mushroom yield decreasing proportional to the ratio of bamboo sawdust. The 100% rubber sawdust substrate provided a higher initial organic matter and carbon content together with C:N ratio at 63.2%, 36.7% and 65.48, respectively, whereas the 100% bamboo sawdust provided higher nitrogen content (1.03%), which was associated with lower mushroom yield but higher number of fruiting bodies. As in the 100% rubber sawdust substrate, a comparable mushroom yield and growth attributes were also obtained in the 3:1 rubber-bamboo sawdust mixture substrate. Principle component analysis of the measured variables indicated a strong influence of substrate C:N ratio before spawning and the change in substrate electrical conductivity and N content after cultivation to the variation in mushroom productivity among the treatments. The results demonstrate the applicability of rubber sawdust and its combination with up to 25% of bamboo sawdust for Yamabushitake mushroom cultivation and provide the basis for substrate optimization in the tropical Yamabushitake mushroom industry through a circular economy framework."

In this research, a new eco-friendly modified cassava starch waste-based adhesive via carboxymethylation (CMS), and blending with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), tannic acid (TA) and green synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was prepared. The effects of TA content on green synthesis of AgNPs (Ag-TA) and bio-adhesive nanocomposite properties were investigated. The use of 5 wt% TA for AgNPs synthesis (Ag-TA-5) resulted in a uniform particle size distribution. The plywood prepared with Ag-TA-5 provided the highest dry and wet shear strength at 1.95 ± 0.11 MPa and 1.38 ± 0.3 MPa, respectively. The water absorption and thickness swelling of this plywood remarkably decreased up to 10.99% and 6.79%, respectively. More importantly, the presence of Ag-TA in CMS/PVA adhesive successfully inhibited the invasion of mold and bacteria. Based on the cyclic delamination test, the adhesive bond durability of bio-adhesive containing Ag-TA-5 could meet the requirement of the AITC Test T110-2007 and was comparable to commercial adhesives. The added advantage of the prepared bio-adhesive was its synthesis from agro-waste products and possible economically viable production at industrial level."

However, the conversion of glucose to HMF using conventional liquid and solid acids is challenging due to the formation of byproducts, leading to low HMF yield. In this study, bifunctional solid acid catalysts (named Al-SA-S15) consisting of aluminum (Al) as Lewis acid sites and sulfonic acid (SA) as Brønsted acid sites were prepared by direct synthesis. The catalysts were then evaluated for the transformation of glucose to HMF using a co-solvent medium of acetone and water. Among the catalysts tested, the 5Al-15SA-S15 catalyst with a Si/Al molar ratio of 5 and a 15 mol% of sulfonic acid groups achieved 95% conversion of glucose and a 51% yield of HMF. The 5Al-15SA-S15 catalyst was found to be stable under the studied conditions, with no leaching of acidic groups observed. It could be easily regenerated by washing with acetone and reused for more than five times without significant loss of performance. This study provides a deep understanding of solid acid catalysts, with precise control of acidic nature and sites for the conversion of biomass into high-value added products."

Methods: This was a combined study between retrospective review of medical records and a cross-sectional survey. The sample size was 500 dyads of antidepressant-treated MDD patients and their unpaid caregivers. MDD patients’ medical records, the concept of healthcare resource utilization, the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: depression and mood & mental state versions (WPAI: D, MM), the Class Impairment Questionnaire (CIQ), and the Family Experiences Interview Schedule (FEIS) were applied as the tools of the study. Pearson Chi’s square, Fisher’s Exact test, and independent T-test were employed for statistical analysis. Results: The proportion of TRD was 19.6% among antidepressant-treated MDD patients in a Thai tertiary public hospital. The results of the study indicated that several factors showed a statistically significant association with TRD criteria. These factors included younger age of MDD patients, a younger age of onset of MDD, lower body mass index (BMI), a history of suicide attempts and self-harm, as well as frequent smoking behavior. The annualized economic cost of TRD was 276,059.97 baht per person ($7,668.33), which was significantly higher than that of cost of non-TRD (173,487.04 baht or $4,819.08). The aggregated economic costs of MDD were 96.8 million baht annually ($2.69 M) if calculated from 500 MDD patients and unpaid caregivers. This contributed to the economic cost of TRD 27.05 million baht (98 respondents) and the economic cost of non-TRD 69.74 million baht (402 respondents). Conclusions: The economic burden associated with TRD was significantly higher compared to non-TRD among antidepressant-treated MDD patients.

['Multidisciplinary'],"Development of Ni–Mo carbide catalyst for production of syngas and CNTs by dry reforming of biogas  2023, Springer Nature Limited.Biogas has been widely regarded as a promising source of renewable energy. Recently, the direct conversion of biogas over heterogeneous catalysts for the simultaneous production of syngas and carbon nanotubes exhibits a high potential for full utilization of biogas with great benefits. Involving the combined dry reforming of methane and catalytic decomposition of methane, the efficiency of process is strongly depended on the catalyst activity/stability, mainly caused by carbon deposition. In this study, Ni–Mo catalyst is engineered to provide a life-long performance and perform high activity in the combined process. The surface modification of catalysts by a controlled carburization pretreatment is proposed for the first time to produce a carbide catalyst along with improving the catalyst stability as well as the reactivity for direct conversion of biogas. The performance of as-prepared carbide catalysts is investigated with comparison to the oxide and metallic ones. As a result, the Ni–Mo2C catalyst exhibited superior activity and stability over its counterparts, even though the condensed nanocarbon was largely grown and covered on the surface. In addition, up to 82% of CH4 conversion and 93% of CO2 conversion could remain almost constant at 800 °C throughout the entire test period of 3 h under a high flowrate inlet stream of pure biogas at 48,000 cm3 g−1 h−1. The XPS spectra of catalysts confirmed that the presence of Mo2C species on the catalyst surface could promote the stability and reactivity of the catalyst, resulting in higher productivity of carbon nanotubes over a longer time."

The accurate quantification of such risks is crucial in managing beaches effectively and establishing warning guidelines. In this study, we employed a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework to assess marine water quality and estimate the risks associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, an autochthonous pathogen that causes gastrointestinal illnesses, and enterococci, a traditional fecal bacteria indicator. The microbial contamination levels of V. parahaemolyticus and enterococci were determined from 48 water samples collected at two beaches in Thailand during dry and wet seasons. The accidentally ingested water volumes were obtained through a survey involving 438 respondents. The probability of illness (Pill) was estimated using dose–response models and Monte Carlo simulation. The results revealed that enterococci posed a higher risk of illness than V. parahaemolyticus at all seven study sites. The median combined gastrointestinal (GI) risk from both bacteria at all sites met the US EPA risk benchmark of 0.036 and the 0.05 benchmark set by the WHO, but the 95th percentile risk data at all sites exceeded the benchmarks. This emphasizes the need for the continuous monitoring and management of microbial pollution at these sites. The site-specific exposure data showed higher estimated risks with increased variations compared to the WHO-referenced values, which highlights the significance of locally measured microbial concentrations and survey exposure data to avoid underestimation. Estimating the risks from recreational exposure to waterborne bacteria can inform beach management policies aimed at reducing public health risks to swimmers. The study findings improve the understanding of the risks associated with water recreation activities at Southeast Asian beaches and offer valuable insights for the development of water quality guidelines, which are crucial for the sustainable development of the blue economy."

Among five possible isomers, isomer A which has an octahedral geometry and a (cis-N/trans-O/cis-Cl) arrangement is the most stable pre-reaction Ti-FI dichloride complex. The isomer A can be activated by MAO to form the active catalyst and the active form was used for the study of the mechanism for Ti-FI. The second ethylene insertion was found to be the rate-determining step of the catalyzed ethylene polymerization. To examine the effect of group IVB transition metals (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) substitutions, calculated activation energies at the rate-determining step (EaRDS) were compared, where values of EaRDS of Zr < Hf < Ti agree with experiments. Moreover, we examined the effect of substitution on (O, X) ligands of the Ti-phenoxy-imine (Ti-1) based catalyst. The results revealed that EaRDS of (O, N) > (O, O) > (O, P) > O, S). Hence, the (O, S) ligand has the highest potential to improve the catalytic activity of the Ti-FI catalyst. We also found the activation energy to be related to the Ti-X distance. In addition, a novel Ni-based FI catalyst was investigated. The results indicated that the nickel (II) complex based on the phenoxy-imine (O, N) ligand in the square-planar geometry is more active than in the octahedral geometry. This work provides fundamental insights into the reaction mechanism of M − FI catalysts which can be used for the design and development of M − FI catalysts for ET polymerization."
"['Clinical Biochemistry', 'Medical Laboratory Technology']","Design and development of a magnetic field-enabled platform for delivering polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles to breast cancer cells  2023 The Author(s)The current literature mostly contains relatively vague descriptions of techniques for implementing in vitro magnetic targeting delivery of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), leading to irreproducible processes and incomparable findings. This discrepancy often arises from the varying exposure of IONPs to the non-uniform magnetic field and differences in the concentration of the polymer-coated IONPs. Hence, we meticulously designed and built a system comprising a platform constructed from polyoxymethylene sheets, which securely holds the permanent magnets, and the cell culture plate. We also tailored the preparation process of the IONPs and the in vitro toxicity studies. The inherent characteristics of IONPs are further enhanced by their coating with natural polymers, alginate (Alg) and chitosan (CS). • The design and construction of the platform were carried out using a laser engraving/cutting machine along with graphic design software. The precise locations of the permanent magnets relative to the cell culture plate were determined via a Gaussmeter. • The quantities of the components in the formulation and the method for fabricating the CS/Alg-coated IONPs (CS/Alg-IONPs) were optimized to ensure that the desired physicochemical properties were obtained. • The cultivation and cytotoxicity evaluation of the fabricated CS/Alg-IONPs against MCF-7 breast cancer cells were described."
"['Pharmacy', 'Health Policy']","After morning, phew! A knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey related to emergency oral contraception in Thai pharmacists  2023, The Author(s).Introduction: Pharmacists’ knowledge and attitude toward Emergency Oral Contraception (EOC) can affect users’ access to EOCs, especially where EOCs are provided by pharmacists without the need for prescriptions. We conducted a Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice (KAP) survey on Thai pharmacists to better understand KAP related to EOCs and the correlation among KAP components. Methods: An in-depth interview, GoogleTrend search, and Pantip.com search were conducted. The findings, together with data from a previously published systematic review and meta-analysis, were used to develop KAP survey questions which were distributed online. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and linear mixed model were used to investigate the correlation and association among KAP components. Results: The in-depth interview with pharmacists showed that sex and unwanted pregnancy are very sensitive topics in Thailand. Sex and EOC education should be provided by parents and healthcare professionals at a young age. This agreed with opinions from Thai internet users that sex literacy was generally low and sex education was not provided adequately. From the total of 421 survey responses, Thai pharmacists had average knowledge, poor attitude, and average practice related to EOCs (median score = 51.02%, 21.81%, and 60.0%, respectively). The correlations between KAP in pharmacists were weak (ρ = 0.107–0.525, p < 0.02). Pharmacists who rated themselves as having higher scores in knowledge and attitude also rated themselves higher in the practice score. However, the total scores describing the knowledge of or attitude toward EOCs were not associated with EOC practice scores. Conclusions: In Thai pharmacists, self-rating KAP scores overestimated total KAP scores. The correlation among KAP components was weak. EOC knowledge and attitudes should be promoted, although this may not improve EOC practice in Thai pharmacists."

It is still unknown how varying periods of anchorage loss contribute to anoikis resistance, cell migration, and metabolic reprogramming of cancerous cells. Results: Our study demonstrated that prolonging the anchorage-free lifetime of non-small-cell lung cancer NCI-H460 cells for 7 days strengthened anoikis resistance, as shown by higher half-life and capability to survive and grow without anchorage, compared to wild-type cells or those losing anchorage for 3 days. While the prolonged anchorage-free lifetime was responsible for the increased aggressive feature of survival cells to perform rapid 3-dimensional migration during the first 3 h of a transwell assay, no significant influence was observed with 2-dimensional surface migration detected at 12 and 24 h by a wound-healing method. Metabolomics analysis revealed significant alteration in the intracellular levels of six (oxalic acid, cholesterol, 1-ethylpyrrolidine, 1-(3-methylbutyl)-2,3,4,6-tetramethylbenzene, β-alanine, and putrescine) among all 37 identified metabolites during 7 days without anchorage. Based on significance values, enrichment ratios, and impact scores of all metabolites and their associated pathways, three principal metabolic activities (non-standard amino acid metabolism, cell membrane biosynthesis, and oxidative stress response) offered potential links with anoikis resistance. Conclusions: These findings further our insights into the evolution of anoikis resistance in lung cancer cells and identify promising biomarkers for early lung cancer diagnosis."

CK and SW of 30% (w/v) together with 5%(w/v) sodium alginate can be 3D-printed into several designed geometries with fine resolution. 4D shape transformation as triggered by thermal stimuli at 80 °C of the printed insect-based objects was found to be varied with infill angle and infill pattern. The ability to form the CK/SW bilayer structure of which shape transformation upon thermal dehydration was similar to that of the structure of a single component suggesting that the culinary applications of the developed edible insect inks can be extended to other 4D-printed multi-nutrient structures. Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry verified that main components of all 4D-printed insect-based constructs were preserved with diminished nutty-like odor verifying that 3D-printing and heating are non-destructive.
['Multidisciplinary'],"The effect of different hemostatic agents following dental extraction in patients under oral antithrombotic therapy: a network meta-analysis  2023, The Author(s).This network meta-analysis was done to thoroughly evaluate the available literature on the use of different hemostatic agents for dental extraction in patients under oral antithrombotic therapy, aiming to identify the agent with the best/worst performance in bleeding control. Considering that such patients have a higher risk of bleeding, choosing the right hemostatic is essential. Twenty-three randomized clinical trials articles were included after completing the literature search. Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive showed a reduction in the odds of postoperative bleeding events compared with conventional methods (i.e., gauze/cotton pressure, sutures), with a tendency toward a statistical significance (OR 0.03, P = 0.051). Tranexamic acid was the only agent that demonstrated a significantly lower risk of developing postoperative bleeding events (OR 0.27, P = 0.007). Interestingly, chitosan dental dressing and collagen plug had the shortest time to reach hemostasis. However, they ranked last among all hemostatic agents, regarding bleeding events, revealing higher odds than conventional measures. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive and tranexamic acid gives favorable results in reducing postoperative bleeding events following dental extractions. Although chitosan dental dressing and collagen exhibited a faster time to reach hemostasis, they led to a higher occurrence of bleeding events."

This bacterium may pose a potential risk to transfusion safety. This study was a cross-sectional study examining the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among Thai blood donors. A total of 1053 serum specimens collected from blood donors residing in 5 regions of Thailand during March to September 2020 were included in this study. All samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to 22 leptospiral serovars using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and anti-Leptospira IgG antibodies using commercially available enzyme immunoassay. We found no evidence of recent exposure to Leptospira spp. in sera of healthy Thai blood donors by MAT, including those in higher-risk areas. However, in this same group, we did find small numbers of past exposure (1.7%) to Leptospira spp. by IgG ELISA. According to the findings of this study, there is currently no evidence for implementing new blood banking procedures to identify possible carriers in Thailand, however these should be continually monitored and revised according to the infectious disease burden in each country. It should be noted that there was a difference in the occupation rate between the general population reported in Thailand and blood donors in this study; it may not reflect the actual situation in the country."

Multiple public reference panels are currently available with variations in size, sequencing depth, and represented populations. Currently, limited data exist regarding the performance of public reference panels when used in an imputation of populations underrepresented in the reference panel. Here, we compare the performance of various public reference panels: 1000 Genomes Project, Haplotype Reference Consortium, GenomeAsia 100 K, and the recent Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, when used in an imputation of samples from the Thai population. Genotype yields were assessed, and imputation accuracies were examined by comparison with high-depth whole genome sequencing data of the same sample. We found that imputation using the TOPMed panel yielded the largest number of variants (~ 271 million). Despite being the smallest in size, GenomeAsia 100 K achieved the best imputation accuracy with a median genotype concordance rate of 0.97. For rare variants, GenomeAsia 100 K also offered the best accuracy, although rare variants were less accurately imputable than common variants (30.3% reduction in concordance rates). The high accuracy observed when using GenomeAsia 100 K is likely attributable to the diverse representation of populations genetically similar to the study cohort emphasizing the benefits of sequencing populations classically underrepresented in human genomics."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Development of peptide nucleic acid-based bead array technology for Bacillus cereus detection  2023, The Author(s).Numerous novel methods to detect foodborne pathogens have been extensively developed to ensure food safety. Among the important foodborne bacteria, Bacillus cereus was identified as a pathogen of concern that causes various food illnesses, leading to interest in developing effective detection methods for this pathogen. Although a standard method based on culturing and biochemical confirmative test is available, it is time- and labor-intensive. Alternative PCR-based methods have been developed but lack high-throughput capacity and ease of use. This study, therefore, attempts to develop a robust method for B. cereus detection by leveraging the highly specific pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as probes for a bead array method with multiplex and high-throughput capacity. In this study, PNAs bearing prolyl-2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (ACPC) backbone with groEL, motB, and 16S rRNA sequences were covalently coupled with three sets of fluorescently barcoded beads to detect the three B. cereus genes. The developed acpcPNA-based bead array exhibited good selectivity where only signals were detectable in the presence of B. cereus, but not for other species. The sensitivity of this acpcPNA-based bead assay in detecting genomic DNA was found to be 0.038, 0.183 and 0.179 ng for groEL, motB and 16S rRNA, respectively. This performance was clearly superior to its DNA counterpart, hence confirming much stronger binding strength of acpcPNA over DNA. The robustness of the developed method was further demonstrated by testing artificially spiked milk and pickled mustard greens with minimal interference from food metrices. Hence, this proof-of-concept acpcPNA-based bead array method has been proven to serve as an effective alternative nucleic acid-based method for foodborne pathogens."

This study determined the proportion of clients participated in telemedicine services and the association between sociodemographic factors and telemedicine participation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The adverse effects within the first seven days post-insertion were also reported. Methods: This retrospective cohort study considered data from all women initiating contraceptive implantation between June 2020 and August 2021 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Clients were offered the following two options for follow-up visits: in-person or communication via an online LINE® Official Account (LINE® OA), a free chat application widely used among the Thais. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between socio-demographic factors and telehealth usage. Results: In total, 574 of 947 (60.6%) clients participated in telemedicine follow-up services during the period considered. A significant association between telemedicine usage and the following were observed: the peak of second wave COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand, using the period preceding the second wave as a reference [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12–1.96)]; participants receiving governmental benefits for contraceptive implant payment (aOR: 3.23, 95% CI: 1.86–5.60), and timing of contraceptive implant(s) initiation, using interval insertion as a reference for which aORs of postpartum and immediate postpartum insertions were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.43–0.90) and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.24–0.52), respectively. Significant ecchymosis at the insertion site was observed in 13.1% of participants. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the significance of telemedicine during the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly in facilitating contraceptive implant initiation. Our data show a significant increase in the uptake and utilization of telemedicine during the pandemic’s peak. The data also shows that during the period of Thailand’s second COVID-19 epidemic, government benefits for contraceptive implant payment, and the timing of contraceptive implant initiation, are significantly associated with telemedicine use. This finding supports the continued use of telemedicine in healthcare, particularly for services like family planning, where remote follow-ups can provide safe, efficient, and timely care."
['Analytical Chemistry'],"A facile and automated microfluidic electrochemical platform for the in-field speciation analysis of inorganic arsenic  2023 Elsevier B.V.An automated microfluidic electrochemical platform was developed for the rapid in-field analysis of arsenic speciation. Herein, we integrated an electrochemical sensing and microfluidic channel for the simultaneous determination of As(III) and total inorganic As (total iAs) within a single device. The platform was fabricated by assembling a gold nanoparticle-modified screen-printed graphene electrode (AuNP/SPGE) on a hydrophilic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet that was specially designed to enclose a microfluidic channel with dual flow channels for separate determination of the two species. While As(III) can be promptly detected with the AuNP/SPGE on one end, thioglycolic acid stored in glass fiber is employed on the other end to reduce As(V) before being electrochemically analyzed on the AuNP/SPGE as total iAs; the difference represents the amount of As(V). With a wireless potentiostat and a smartphone equipped with Bluetooth technology, the overall procedure can be fully automated and accomplished merely within 9 min. The linear ranges for the determination of As(III) and total iAs were found to be 50–1000 and 100–1500 ng/mL with detection limits of 3.7 and 17 ng/mL, respectively. The proposed method was validated and applied for the inorganic As speciation of various food samples with satisfactory results compared to those obtained with the standard HPLC-ICP‒MS protocol. This novel microfluidic electrochemical platform offers numerous advantages, notably for its simplicity, speed, low cost, and portability for on-site analysis, which conclusively makes it a highly promising analytical device for the speciation of inorganic arsenic."

In response to the need for patient-centered care, patients’ and physicians’ preferences for knee osteoarthritis treatments have been studied in multiple countries, but not in Thailand. The objective of this study was to investigate Thai patients’ preferences and their willingness to pay (WTP) for knee osteoarthritis treatments by using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Six knee osteoarthritis treatment attributes, including pain relief, delayed disease progression, gastrointestinal side effects, kidney side effects, cardiovascular side effects, and cost, were used to develop a paper-based, DCE questionnaire survey. Patients with knee osteoarthritis, who were at least 18 years old and who provided written informed consent, were recruited from the orthopedic department in a tertiary care hospital in Thailand via convenience sampling. The conditional logit model was used to determine patients’ preferences and WTP. The Institutional Review Board at Chulalongkorn University approved this study before it started. A total of 232 patients were collected and analyzed in this study. Patients preferred treatments with a higher efficacy (pain relief and delayed disease progression), a lower probability of side effects (gastrointestinal, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects), and a lower cost. Regarding efficacy and side effects, the patients weighted the importance of a 1% change in cardiovascular side effects (− 0.08) more heavily than 1% changes in kidney (− 0.07) and gastrointestinal (− 0.02) side effects, delayed disease progression (0.02), and pain relief (0.01). Patients were willing to pay 29.56 Thai Baht (THB) and 41.84 THB per month for every 1% increase in pain relief and delayed disease progression, respectively. Conversely, patients were willing to pay 52.04 THB, 145.18 THB and 164.23 THB per month for every 1% decrease in gastrointestinal, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects, respectively. In conclusion, pain relief, delayed disease progression, gastrointestinal side effects, kidney side effects, cardiovascular side effects, and the cost of treatment were significant factors among patients undergoing knee osteoarthritis treatment. Additionally, patients had a higher WTP for delayed disease progression than pain relief and a higher WTP for a reduced probability of cardiovascular side effects than gastrointestinal and kidney side effects. These findings could be used to support treatment decisions for knee osteoarthritis patients in Thailand."

Previous studies focused on mutations in the RUNX2 RHD domain, with limited investigation of mutations in the C-terminal domain. This study aimed to investigate the functional consequences of C-terminal mutations in RUNX2. Eight mutations were analyzed, and their effects on transactivation activity, protein expression, subcellular localization, and osteogenic potential were studied. Truncating mutations in the PST region and a missense mutation in the NMTS region resulted in increased transactivation activity, while missense mutations in the PST showed activity comparable to the control. Truncating mutations produced truncated proteins, while missense mutations produced normal-sized proteins. Mutant proteins were mislocalized, with six mutant proteins detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. CCD patient bone cells exhibited mislocalization of RUNX2, similar to the generated mutant. Mislocalization of RUNX2 and reduced expression of downstream genes were observed in MSCs from a CCD patient with the p.Ser247Valfs*3 mutation, leading to compromised osteogenic potential. This study provides insight into the functional consequences of C-terminal mutations in RUNX2, including reduced expression, mislocalization, and aberrant transactivation of downstream genes, contributing to the compromised osteogenic potential observed in CCD."

We characterized 144 ExPEC strains (collected from a tertiary cancer institute) in terms of antimicrobial susceptibility spectrum, ESBL variants, virulence factors (VF) patterns, and Clermont’s phylogroup classification. The developed multiplex recombinase polymerase amplification and thermophilic helicase-dependent amplification (tHDA) assays for bla CTX-M, bla OXA, bla SHV, and bla TEM detection, respectively, were validated using PCR-sequencing results. All ESBL-ExPEC isolates carried bla CTX-M genes with following prevalence frequency of variants: bla CTX-M-15 (50.5%) > bla CTX-M-55 (17.9%) > bla CTX-M-27 (16.8%) > bla CTX-M-14 (14.7%). The multiplex recombinase polymerase amplification assay had 100% sensitivity, and specificity for bla CTX-M, bla OXA, bla SHV, while tHDA had 86.89% sensitivity, and 100% specificity for bla TEM. The VF genes showed the following prevalence frequency: traT (67.4%) > ompT (52.6%) > iutA (50.5%) > fimH (47.4%) > iha (33.7%) > hlyA (26.3%) > papC (12.6%) > cvaC (3.2%), in ESBL-ExPEC isolates which belonged to phylogroups A (28.4%), B2 (28.4%), and F (22.1%). The distribution of traT, ompT, and hlyA and phylogroup B2 were significantly different (P < 0.05) between ESBL-ExPEC and non-ESBL-ExPEC isolates. Thus, these equipment-free isothermal resistance gene amplification assays contribute to effective treatment and control of virulent ExPEC, especially antimicrobial resistance strains."

We studied the faecal microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and faecal microbiome functionality (metaproteomics) in a cohort of 40 infants diagnosed with cow’s milk allergy (CMA) when entering the study. Some of the infants showed outgrowth of CMA after 12 months, while others did not. Faecal microbiota composition of infants was analysed directly after CMA diagnosis (baseline) as well as 6 and 12 months after entering the study. The aim was to gain insight on gut microbiome parameters in relation to outgrowth of CMA. The results of this study show that microbiome differences related to outgrowth of CMA can be mainly identified at the taxonomic level of the 16S rRNA gene, and to a lesser extent at the protein-based microbial taxonomy and functional protein level. At the 16S rRNA gene level outgrowth of CMA is characterized by lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae at baseline and lower Bacteroidaceae at visit 12 months."
['Education'],"Knowledge, attitude, and intended practice of abortion among pharmacy students in Thailand after the amendment of the Thai Abortion Law  2023, The Author(s).Background: The recently amended Thai abortion law allows pregnant women to undergo abortions up to the gestational age of 12 weeks. Medical abortion is significant because it has revolutionized access to safe abortion care—abortion medicine can now be safely and effectively administered outside of a healthcare facility to women in early pregnancy. This contribution supports the pharmacists’ role in interprofessional safe abortion teamwork. Adequate knowledge of the current laws regarding safe abortion services will increase pharmacists’ competence in providing services. However, safe abortions as a subject have not been formally incorporated into the curriculum for Thai pharmacy students. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and intended practice of fifth-year pharmacy students at Chulalongkorn University. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic self-administered questionnaire adapted from previously published studies to evaluate participants’ knowledge of the recently amended Thai abortion law, attitude toward abortion, and intended practices. The invitations were sent to all fifth-year pharmacy students at Chulalongkorn University. Results: Among all invitations sent, 104/150 (69.3%) participants responded to the survey. Only a third of the participants (31.7%) had good knowledge scores. Based on five questions regarding the gestational age limit for legal abortion, most participants (52.7%) answered questions incorrectly. Although more than half of the participants (52.5%) disagreed with two pro-choice statements, an overwhelming majority (87.5%) agreed that abortion was a woman’s right. Safe abortion services were mostly agreed upon with serious fetal defects (91.9%), non-HIV maternal health conditions (82.2%), and sexual assaults (77.4%). A positive attitude toward abortion affects the intention to perform an abortion under socioeconomic conditions. Conclusion: Most participants lacked knowledge on the amended abortion law, especially on the gestational limits of abortion. Participants with favorable attitudes toward abortion tended to be more liberal regarding safe abortion services."

Over expression of pSTAT3 induces IL-6 positive feedback loop causing cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm. Plants have gained momentum as an alternative expression system. Hence, this study aims to produce mAb targeting human IL-6 receptor (hIL-6R) in Nicotiana benthamiana for down regulating its cellular signaling thus, decreasing the expression of pSTAT3. The variable regions of heavy and light chains of anti-hIL-6R mAb were constructed in pBYK2e geminiviral plant expression vector and transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana. The results demonstrate the proper protein assembly of anti-hIL-6R mAb with highest expression level of 2.24 mg/g FW at 5 dpi, with a yield of 21.4 µg/g FW after purification. The purity and N-glycosylation of plant produced antibody was analyzed, including its specificity to human IL-6 receptor by ELISA. Additionally, we investigated the effect to pSTAT3 expression in human PBMC’s by flow cytometry wherein, the results confirmed lower expression of pSTAT3 with increasing concentrations of plant produced anti-hIL-6R mAb. Although, further in vivo studies are key to unveil the absolute functionality of anti-hIL-6R, we hereby show the potential of the plant platform and its suitability for the production of this therapeutic antibody."

After setting iodine treatment devices, the DCU was allowed to operate normally. 25 ml of water from airotors lines were collected weekly for enumerating bacteria. The viability of biofilms in DUWLs was quantified by ATP testing kit. The amount of iodine released into the procedural water was also quantified. Results: The continuous presence of iodine could significantly control bacterial contamination in the DUWL to be less than 500 CFU/mL, the standard level recommended by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Iodine treatment can reduce bacterial CFU up to 98–100%. Biofilm viability in the iodine group was slightly lower than that of the control group though not statistically significant. After eleven months, the average iodine release was measured to be 3.6 ppm which is still effective in controlling bacterial contamination. Conclusion: Continuously supplying iodine in DUWLs effectively controls microbial contamination."

This study presents a case study on numerical simulations of CO2 injection into Permian carbonate reservoir in the Sin Phu Horm gas field, which will become a depleted gas field in 2037. Schlumberger Petrel and ECLIPSE are used for reservoir modeling and simulation. One injection well located at the crest of the anticlinal structure is designed to perform injection of CO2 into the dolomite unit of the Pha Nok Khao Formation at approximately 2037 m from earth surface. This simulation of CO2 injection aims to verify cumulative amount of CO2 after injection and to predict reservoir pressure for 50 years. The results show that at the end of 50-year CO2 injection, reservoir pressure increases from 2478 to 2750 psi. The latest pressure remains below the initial pressure (3900 psi) at the beginning of production phase in 2007. With injection rate at 530 tCO2 per day or 0.19 MtCO2 per year up to 50 years, the total amount of injected CO2 in the reservoir is 9.5 Mt. This case study demonstrates that the dolomite reservoir of the Sin PHu Horm field can accommodate CO2 from constant injection rate at 530 tCO2 per day or up to 50 years. The findings can guide site selection decisions in Permian carbonate reservoirs for CO2 storage demonstrations."
['Multidisciplinary'],"MarketTrust: blockchain-based trust evaluation model for SIoT-based smart marketplaces  2023, The Author(s).Due to the significance of trust in Social Internet of Things (SIoT)-based smart marketplaces, several research have focused on trust-related challenges. Trust is necessary for a smooth connection, secure systems, and dependable services during trade operations. Recent SIoT-based trust assessment approaches attempt to solve smart marketplace trust evaluation difficulties by using a variety of direct and indirect trust evaluation techniques and other local trust rating procedures. Nevertheless, these methodologies render trust assessment very sensitive to seller dishonesty, and a dishonest seller may influence local trust scores and at the same time pose a significant trust related threats in the system. In this article, a MarketTrust model is introduced, which is a blockchain-based method for assessing trust in an IoT-based smart marketplace. It has three parts: familiarity, personal interactions, and public perception. A conceptual model, assessment technique, and a global trust evaluation system for merging the three components of a trust value are presented and discussed. Several experiments were conducted to assess the model's security, viability, and efficacy. According to results, the MarketTrust model scored a 21.99% higher trust score and a 47.698% lower average latency than both benchmark models. Therefore, this illustrates that using the proposed framework, a potential buyer can efficiently choose a competent and trustworthy resource seller in a smart marketplace and significantly reduce malicious behavior."

The proposed framework, called Augmented Stage-Gate, integrates the next-generation Agile Stage-Gate development process with lean startup and design thinking approaches. The framework consists of six stages and five gates and focuses on critical thinking to help entrepreneurs avoid psychological traps and make the right decisions. Early activities focus on scouting for potential socioeconomically impactful deep-tech research, developing a business case, market analysis, and strategy for problem–solution fit, and then, moving to a build–measure–learn activity with a validated learning feedback loop. Next, suitable exploitation methods are decided using weight factor analysis, developing intellectual property (IP) strategy, completing the university technology transfer process, and participating in fundraising. To pass each gate, the committee board members, consisting of tech, business, IP and regulatory, and domain experts, will evaluate the passing criteria to decide Go/No-Go. Applying the framework to the case studies results in successful university research commercialization. The model, case study, and lessons learned in this paper can be useful for other deep-tech incubator programs to successfully launch deep-tech research for commercialization. The case studies’ positive outcomes validate the Augmented Stage-Gate framework, yet their success is not entirely guaranteed due to external factors like regulatory constraints, entrepreneur characteristics, timing, and the necessary ecosystem or infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets. These factors should be taken into account for future research purposes."

Materials and methods: Intermittent compressive force (ICF) and shear force (SF) were applied to human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Protein expression of collagen I and POSTN was analyzed by western blot technique. To establish an in vivo model, rat maxillary molars were extracted to facilitate hypofunction of the periodontal ligament (PDL) tissue of the opposing mandibular molar. The mandibles were collected after 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks post-extraction and used for micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis. Results: ICF and SF increased the synthesis of POSTN by human PDLSCs. Histological changes in the hypofunctional teeth revealed a narrowing of the PDL space, along with a decreased amount of collagen I, POSTN, and laminin in perivascular structures compared to the functional contralateral molars. Conclusion: Our results revealed that loss of occlusal force disrupts deposition of some major matrix proteins in the PDL, underscoring the relevance of mechanical forces in maintaining periodontal tissue homeostasis by modulating ECM composition."

Nevertheless, the effects of drugs in mitral regurgitation patients, from the molecular level to therapeutic effects, remain unclear. This study investigates the roles of SAC/VAL on cardiac function, mitochondrial quality, autophagy, mitophagy, and natriuretic peptides in a rat model of chronic mitral regurgitation. Male Sprague–Dawley rats underwent MR induction (n = 16) and sham surgeries (n = 8). Four weeks post-surgery confirmed MR rats were randomly divided into MR (n = 8) and SAC/VAL (n = 8) groups. The SAC/VAL group was administered SAC/VAL, whereas the MR and the sham rats received vehicle via oral gavage daily for 8 weeks. Cardiac geometry, function, and myocardial fibrosis were assessed by echocardiography and histopathology. Spectrophotometry and real-time PCR were performed to assess the pharmacological effects on mitochondrial quality, autophagy, mitophagy, and natriuretic peptides. MR rats demonstrated significant left heart dilation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction compared with the sham group, which could be significantly improved by SAC/VAL. In addition, SAC/VAL significantly reduced myocardial cardiac remodeling and fibrosis in MR rats. SAC/VAL improved the mitochondrial quality by attenuating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial depolarization compared with the MR group. Also, the upregulation of autophagy-related, mitophagy-related, and natriuretic peptide system gene expression in MR rats was attenuated by SAC/VAL treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SAC/VAL treatment could provide numerous beneficial effects in MR conditions, suggesting that this drug may be an effective treatment for MR."
['Multidisciplinary'],"An extinct deep-snouted Alligator species from the Quaternary of Thailand and comments on the evolution of crushing dentition in alligatorids  2023, The Author(s).Fossil Alligator remains from Asia are critical for tracing the enigmatic evolutionary origin of the Chinese alligator, Alligator sinensis, the only living representative of Alligatoridae outside the New World. The Asian fossil record is extremely scarce and it remains unknown whether A. sinensis is an anagenetic lineage or alternatively, extinct divergent species were once present. We provide a detailed comparative description of a morphologically highly distinct Alligator skull from the Quaternary of Thailand. Several autapomorphic characters warrant the designation of a new species. Alligator munensis sp. nov. shares obvious derived features with A. sinensis but autapomorphies imply a cladogenetic split, possibly driven by the uplift of the southeastern Tibetan plateau. The presence of enlarged posterior alveoli in Alligator munensis is most consistent with a reversal to the alligatorine ancestral condition of having crushing dentition, a morphology strikingly absent among living alligatorids. Crushing dentition has been previously considered to indicate an ecological specialisation in early alligatorines that was subsequently lost in Alligator spp. However, we argue that there is yet no evidence for crushing dentition reflecting an adaptation for a narrower niche, while opportunistic feeding, including seasonal utilisation of hard-shelled preys, is a reasonable alternative interpretation of its function."
"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","Assessing the acceptability and feasibility of reactive drug administration for malaria elimination in a Plasmodium vivax predominant setting: a qualitative study in two provinces in Thailand  2023, The Author(s).Background: Reactive case detection (RACD) or testing and treatment of close contacts of recent malaria cases, is commonly practiced in settings approaching malaria elimination, but standard diagnostics have limited sensitivity to detect low level infections. Reactive drug administration (RDA), or presumptive treatment without testing, is an alternative approach, but better understanding regarding community acceptability and operational feasibility are needed. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted as part of a two-arm cluster randomized-controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of RDA targeting high-risk villages and forest workers for reducing Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum malaria in Thailand. Key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted virtually among key public health staff, village health volunteers (VHVs), and household members that implemented or received RDA activities. Transcriptions were reviewed, coded, and managed manually using Dedoose qualitative data analysis software, then underwent qualitative content analysis to identify key themes. Results: RDA was well accepted by household members and public health staff that implemented it. RDA participation was driven by fear of contracting malaria, eagerness to receive protection provided by malaria medicines, and the increased access to health care. Concerns were raised about the safety of taking malaria medicines without having an illness, particularly if underlying health conditions existed. Health promotion hospital (HPH) staff implementing RDA noted its operational feasibility, but highlighted difficulty in traveling to remote areas, and requested additional travel resources and hiring more VHVs. Other challenges were highlighted including the need for additional training for VHVs on malaria activities and the inability of HPH staff to conduct RDA due to other health priorities (e.g., Covid-19). More training and practice for VHVs were noted as ways to improve implementation of RDA. Conclusions: To maximize uptake of RDA, regular education and sensitization campaigns in collaboration with village leaders on the purpose and rationale of RDA will be critical. To alleviate safety concerns and increase participant safety, a rigorous pharmacovigilance program will be important. To accelerate uptake of RDA, trust between HPH staff and VHVs and the communities they serve must continue to be strengthened to ensure acceptance of the intervention. Trial registration: This study was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the University of California San Francisco (19–28,060) and the local Ethics Committee for Research in Human Subjects at Tak Provincial Health office (009/63) and Kanchanaburi Provincial health office (Kor Chor 0032.002/2185).

Although venoms from king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah; OH) and green pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) showed the broadest antibacterial spectrum, OH venom demonstrated more profound anti-biofilm activities against P. aeruginosa. Additionally, purified l-amino acid oxidase from OH venom (OH-LAAO), using a three-step chromatography and protein identification, reduced biofilm mass as indicated by the downregulation of several genes, including the genes for biofilm synthesis (algD and pslB) and biofilm regulators (algU, gacA, and siaD). Moreover, OH-LAAO disrupted Pseudomonas-preformed biofilms via upregulation of several genes for biofilm dispersion (nbdA, bdlA, and dipA) and biofilm degradation (endA and pslG), resulting in a reduction of the biofilm biomass. Due to the antimicrobial effects and anti-biofilm activities (reduced production plus increased dispersion) neutralized by catalase, a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-degrading enzyme, the enhanced H2O2 by OH venom might be one of the anti-biofilm mechanisms. Hence, OH-LAAO was proposed as a novel agent against Pseudomonas biofilms for either treatment or prevention. More studies are interesting."

Extracellular ATP (eATP) has a pivotal role in both physiological and pathological processes of periodontal ligament tissues. Here, this review aimed to explore the various functions of eATP that are involved in the control of behaviours and functions of periodontal ligament cells. Methods: To identify the included publications for review, the articles were searched in PubMed (MEDLINE) and SCOPUS with the keywords of adenosine triphosphate and periodontal ligament cells. Thirteen publications were used as the main publications for discussion in the present review. Results: eATP has been implicated as a potent stimulator for inflammation initiation in periodontal tissues. It also plays a role in proliferation, differentiation, remodelling, and immunosuppressive functions of periodontal ligament cells. Yet, eATP has diverse functions in regulating periodontal tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Conclusion: eATP may provide a new prospect for periodontal tissue healing as well as treatment of periodontal disease especially periodontitis. It may be utilized as a useful therapeutic tool for future periodontal regeneration therapy."

Methods: Lateral cephalograms were digitized and traced by three calibrated senior orthodontic residents with or without artificial intelligence (AI) assistance. The same radiographs of 43 patients were uploaded to AI-based machine learning programs MyOrthoX, Angelalign, and Digident. Image J was used to extract x- and y-coordinates for 32 cephalometric points: 11 soft tissue landmarks and 21 hard tissue landmarks. The mean radical errors (MRE) were assessed radical to the threshold of 1.0 mm,1.5 mm, and 2 mm to compare the successful detection rate (SDR). One-way ANOVA analysis at a significance level of P <.05 was used to compare MRE and SDR. The SPSS (IBM-vs. 27.0) and PRISM (GraphPad-vs.8.0.2) software were used for the data analysis. Results: Experimental results showed that three methods were able to achieve detection rates greater than 85% using the 2 mm precision threshold, which is the acceptable range in clinical practice. The Angelalign group even achieved a detection rate greater than 78.08% using the 1.0 mm threshold. A marked difference in time was found between the AI-assisted group and the manual group due to heterogeneity in the performance of techniques to detect the same landmark. Conclusions: AI assistance may increase efficiency without compromising accuracy with cephalometric tracings in routine clinical practice and research settings."
['Plant Science'],"Effect of mixed light emitting diode spectrum on antioxidants content and antioxidant activity of red lettuce grown in a closed soilless system  2023, The Author(s).Background: Light spectra have been demonstrated to result in different levels of comfort or stress, which affect plant growth and the availability of health-promoting compounds in ways that sometimes contradict one another. To determine the optimal light conditions, it is necessary to weigh the vegetable’s mass against the amount of nutrients it contains, as vegetables tend to grow poorly in environments where nutrient synthesis is optimal. This study investigates the effects of varying light conditions on the growth of red lettuce and its occurring nutrients in terms of productivities, which were determined by multiplying the total weight of the harvested vegetables by their nutrient content, particularly phenolics. Three different light-emitting diode (LED) spectral mixes, including blue, green, and red, which were all supplemented by white, denoted as BW, GW, and RW, respectively, as well as the standard white as the control, were equipped in grow tents with soilless cultivation systems for such purposes. Results: Results demonstrated that the biomass and fiber content did not differ substantially across treatments. This could be due to the use of a modest amount of broad-spectrum white LEDs, which could help retain the lettuce’s core qualities. However, the concentrations of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity in lettuce grown with the BW treatment were the highest (1.3 and 1.4-fold higher than those obtained from the control, respectively), with chlorogenic acid accumulation (8.4 ± 1.5 mg g− 1 DW) being particularly notable. Meanwhile, the study observed a high glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the plant achieved from the RW treatment, which in this study was deemed the poorest treatment in terms of phenolics accumulation. Conclusion: In this study, the BW treatment provided the most efficient mixed light spectrum to stimulate phenolics productivity in red lettuce without a significant detrimental effect on other key properties."

Control measure for the mosquito population plays an essential role in the fight against the disease. Currently, several intervention strategies; chemical-, biological-, mechanical- and environmental methods remain under development and need further improvement in their effectiveness. Although, a conventional entomological surveillance, required a microscope and taxonomic key for identification by professionals, is a key strategy to evaluate the population growth of these mosquitoes, these techniques are tedious, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and reliant on skillful and well-trained personnel. Here, we proposed an automatic screening, namely the deep metric learning approach and its inference under the image-retrieval process with Euclidean distance-based similarity. We aimed to develop the optimized model to find suitable miners and suggested the robustness of the proposed model by evaluating it with unseen data under a 20-returned image system. During the model development, well-trained ResNet34 are outstanding and no performance difference when comparing five data miners that showed up to 98% in its precision even after testing the model with both image sources: stereomicroscope and mobile phone cameras. The robustness of the proposed—trained model was tested with secondary unseen data which showed different environmental factors such as lighting, image scales, background colors and zoom levels. Nevertheless, our proposed neural network still has great performance with greater than 95% for sensitivity and precision, respectively. Also, the area under the ROC curve given the learning system seems to be practical and empirical with its value greater than 0.960. The results of the study may be used by public health authorities to locate mosquito vectors nearby. If used in the field, our research tool in particular is believed to accurately represent a real-world scenario."

Developing anti-venoms for Ves a 1 using chemical drugs, such as chemical drug guide, remains a challenging task. In this study, we screened 2056 drugs against the opening conformation of the venom using the ZINC 15 and e-Drug 3D databases. The binding free energy of the top five drug candidates complexed with Ves a 1 was calculated using 300-ns-MD trajectories. Our results revealed that voxilaprevir had a higher binding free energy at the catalytic sites than other drug candidates. Furthermore, the MD simulation results indicated that voxilaprevir formed stable conformations within the catalytic pocket. Consequently, voxilaprevir could act as a potent inhibitor, opening up avenues for the development of more effective anti-venom therapeutics for Ves a 1."

Herein, we study the mixing thermodynamics and the mechanical properties of AlB 2 -structured Sc 1-x Ta x B 2 solid solutions using the first-principles method, based on the density functional theory, and the cluster-expansion formalism. Our thermodynamic investigation reveals that the two diborides readily mix with one another to form a continuous series of stable solid solutions in the pseudo-binary TaB 2- ScB 2 system even at absolute zero. Interestingly, the elastic moduli as well as the hardness of the solid solutions show significant positive deviations from the linear Vegard’s rule evaluated between those of ScB 2 and TaB 2 . In case of Sc 1-x Ta x B 2 , the degrees of deviation from such linear trends can be as large as 25, 20, and 40% for the shear modulus, the Young’s modulus, and the hardness, respectively. The improvement in the stability as well as the mechanical properties of Sc 1-x Ta x B 2 solid solutions relative to their constituent compounds is found to be related to the effect of electronic band filling, induced upon mixing TaB 2 with ScB 2 . These findings not only demonstrate the prominent role of band filling in enhancing the stability and the mechanical properties of Sc 1-x Ta x B 2 , but also it can potentially open up a possibility for designing stable/metastable metal diboride-based solid solutions with superior and widely tunable mechanical properties for hard-coating applications."

Materials and methods: PMMA-based occlusal splints and extracted premolars were tested on a chewing stimulator at 30,000 or 60,000 cycles. Dentin wear was measured under a stereomicroscope and PMMA wear was determined with an optical profilometer. In addition, wear surface topography was assessed and quantified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: Wear rate of PMMA was significantly greater (11 times) than that of dentin specimens at 60,000 cycles, though these findings were not observed at 30,000 cycles. When comparing wear rates within each group at different duration cycles, PMMA surfaces exhibited an average wear rate 1.4 times higher with high duration cycles, while dentin surfaces displayed a marginal decrease in wear. In SEM micrographs, PMMA surfaces displayed more wear abrasion lines with higher duration cycles. However, dentin surfaces did not exhibit major differences between low and high duration cycles. Conclusion: Wear rate on PMMA-based occlusal splints remarkably increases upon high chewing cycles mimicking bruxism comparing with the rate on dentin. Hence, it is reasonable for bruxing patients to wear single-arch PMMA-based occlusal splints to protect opposing dentin-exposed teeth."

This practice has not changed much despite increasing evidence that CS is not useful in many cases. The Gonad And Patient Shielding (GAPS) group—founded by representatives of the main European bodies involved in radiology—promoted this survey to assess the current practice of CS among European radiology departments and the attitude towards a non-shielding policy. Methods: Over a four-month period (15 May–15th September 2021) European Society of Radiology and European Society of Paediatric Radiology radiologist members were invited to respond to a web-based questionnaire consisting of 59 questions. Results: 225 centres from 35 countries responded to this survey. CS was routinely applied in at least one radiological modality in 49.2% of centres performing studies in adults, 57.5% of centres performing studies in children, and 47.8% of centres performing studies on pregnant women. CS was most frequently used in conventional radiography, where the most frequently shielded organs were the gonads, followed by thyroid, female breasts, and eye lens. 83.6% respondents would follow European recommendations on the use of CS when provided by the main European bodies involved in radiology. Conclusions: This review shows that CS is still largely used across Europe. However, a non-shielding policy could be adopted in most departments if European professional societies provided recommendations. In this regard, a strong commitment by European and national professional societies to educate and inform practitioners, patients and carers is paramount. Clinical relevance statement: According to this survey expectations of patients and carers, and skepticism amongprofessionals about the limited benefits of CS are the most important obstacles to the application of a no-shielding policy. A strong commitment from European and national professional societies to inform practitioners, patients and carers is fundamental. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"

Microalgae has been found as a potential source for bioplastic production, besides its more common application in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry. In this study, the objective was to techno-economically evaluate the large-scale co-production of Spirulina powder as food supplements and edible bioplastic for food packaging. The scale of production was large enough to satisfy 1% of local (Thailand) plastic demand (i.e., approx. 1200 MT y−1), and 1% of the global Spirulina demand (approx. 1000 MT y−1) as food supplements. Results showed that the co-production of the Spirulina powder and bioplastic revealed an attractive venture with a payback time (PBT) as low as 2.6 y and ROI as high as 38.5%. This was because the revenues generated were as high as US$ 55.6 million y−1, despite high capital (US$ 55.7 million) and operating (US$ 34.9 million y−1) costs. Sensitivity analysis showed differences in the profitability based on variations of major parameters in the study, where the split ratio of biomass used for food supplement versus bioplastic production and the bioplastic’s selling price were found to be the most sensitive."

However, this English questionnaire is difficult for Thai parents to complete. The purpose of this study is to translate the PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF into Thai and test its reliability and validity. Methods: The PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF was translated into Thai using FACIT translation methodology. This version and the Thai version of the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (Thai-MHQ) were used to evaluate 30 Thai children with different types of congenital upper extremity anomalies. The reliability and validity of the Thai-PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF were evaluated by test-and-retest with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Correlations between the Thai-PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF and Thai-MHQ were analysed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Results: The children’s mean age was 4.47 ± 2.08 years (range 1–9 years). The main diagnoses included thumb duplication (11 children), syndactyly (4 children)4, congenital trigger thumb (3 children) and obstetric brachial plexus palsy (3 children). The children’s parents completed the questionnaires, taking 164.23 ± 22.58 s for the Thai-PROMIS and 337.8 ± 49.37 s for the Thai-MHQ. The test-retest reliability of Thai-PROMIS evaluated by ICCs, was 0.9909 (good reliability), and the Cronbach’s alpha of all items was 0.923.

PmDOME and PmSTAT were up-regulated in shrimp hemocytes upon WSSV infection. Suppression of PmDOME and PmSTAT showed significant impacts on the expression levels of ProPO2 (melanization), Vago5 (interferon-like protein) and several antimicrobial peptides, including ALFPm3, Penaeidin3, CrustinPm1 and CrustinPm7. Silencing of PmDOME and PmSTAT reduced WSSV copy numbers and delayed the cumulative mortality caused by WSSV. We postulated that suppression of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway may activate the proPO, IFN-like antiviral cytokine and AMP production, resulting in a delay of WSSV-related mortality."

Here, we postulated that calcium supplement prepared from tuna bone with tuna head oil should benefit for skeletal development than CaCO3. Forty female 4-week-old rats were divided into calcium-replete diet (0.55% w/w, S1, n = 8) and low-calcium groups (0.15% w/w for 2 weeks; L; n = 32). Then L were subdivided into 4 groups (8/group), i.e., remained on L, L + tuna bone (S2), S2 + tuna head oil + 25(OH)D3 and S2 + 25(OH)D3. Bone specimens were collected at week 9. We found that 2 weeks on low calcium diet led to low bone mineral density (BMD), reduced mineral content, and impaired mechanical properties in young growing rats. Intestinal fractional calcium absorption also increased, presumably resulting from higher plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 (1.712 ± 0.158 in L vs. 1.214 ± 0.105 nM in S1, P < 0.05). Four-week calcium supplementation from tuna bone further increased calcium absorption efficacy, which later returned to the basal level by week 9. Calcium supplementation successfully restored BMD, bone strength and microstructure. However, 25(OH)D3 + tuna head oil + tuna bone showed no additive effect. Voluntary running also effectively prevented bone defects. In conclusion, both tuna bone calcium supplementation and exercise are effective interventions for mitigating calcium-deficient bone loss."

A shortened version of the Oral Impact on Daily Performances (OIDP) might be more practical and feasible in clinical setting due to the busy nature of oral medicine clinics and staff availability to conduct the interview for data collection. The aim of the study was to develop a Thai version of shortened OIDP for assessing the OHRQoL in OLP patients. Methods: Two types of shortened OIDP versions were tested in 69 OLP patients, one comprising the most commonly interfered with daily performances (OIDP-3 and OIDP-2) and another comprising either the highest frequency (OIDP frequency) or severity score (OIDP severity). The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Thongprasom sign score were used to assess oral pain and clinical severity. Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients (rs) were used to demonstrate the associations between the shortened and original OIDP, pain, and clinical severity. Results: OIDP-3 (Eating, Cleaning, and Emotional stability) and OIDP-2 (Eating and Emotional stability) were developed. The associations of the original OIDP with OIDP-3 and OIDP-2 (rs = 0.965 and 0.911) were significantly higher than those of the original OIDP with OIDP frequency and OIDP severity (rs = 0.768 and 0.880). The original OIDP, OIDP-3, and OIDP-2 were more significantly associated with pain compared with OIDP frequency and OIDP severity. The association between the clinical severity and oral impacts assessed by the original OIDP, OIDP-3, and OIDP-2 were similar and had higher correlation coefficients compared with those of OIDP frequency and OIDP severity. Conclusion: OIDP-3 and OIDP-2 performed more similarly to the original OIDP than OIDP frequency and OIDP severity in assessing the OHRQoL of OLP patients. Trial registration: The trial was registered at the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR identifier: TCTR 20190828002)."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Upgradation of methane in the biogas by hydrogenation of CO2 in a prototype reactor with double pass operation over optimized Ni-Ce/Al-MCM-41 catalyst  2023, The Author(s).The upgradation of methane in biogas by hydrogenation of CO2 has been currently recognized as a promising route for efficient full utilization of renewable biogas with potential benefits for storage of renewable hydrogen energy and abatement of greenhouse gas emission. As a main constituent of biogas, CO2 can act as a backbone for the formation of additional CH4 by hydrogenation, then producing higher amounts of biomethane. In this work, the upgradation process was investigated in a prototype reactor of double pass operation with vertical alignment using an optimized Ni-Ce/Al-MCM-41 catalyst. The experimental results show that the double pass operation that removes water vapor during the run can significantly increase CO2 conversion, resulting in higher CH4 production yield. As a result, the purity of biomethane increased by 15% higher than a single pass operation. In addition, search for optimum condition of the process was carried out within an investigated range of conditions including flowrate (77–1108 ml min−1), pressure (1 atm–20 bar), and temperature (200–500 °C). The durability test for 458 h was performed using the obtained optimum condition, and it shows that the optimized catalyst can perform excellent stability with negligible influence by the observed change in catalyst properties. The comprehensive characterization on physicochemical properties of fresh and spent catalysts was performed, and the results were discussed."

We aimed to investigate associations between reproductive factors and history of exogenous hormone use with distal sensory polyneuropathy among postmenopausal women in the United States using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2004, and to explore the modifying effects of ethnicity on these associations. We conducted a cross-sectional study among postmenopausal women aged ≥ 40 years. Women with a history of diabetes, stroke, cancer, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, liver disease, weak or failing kidneys, or amputation were excluded. Distal sensory polyneuropathy was measured using a 10-g monofilament test, and a questionnaire was used to collect data on reproductive history. Multivariable survey logistic regression was used to test the association between reproductive history variables and distal sensory polyneuropathy. In total, 1144 postmenopausal women aged ≥ 40 years were included. The adjusted odds ratios were 8.13 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–53.28] and 3.18 (95% CI 1.32–7.68) for age at menarche < 11 years and time since menopause > 20 years, respectively, which were positively associated with distal sensory polyneuropathy; adjusted odds ratios were 0.45 for the history of breastfeeding (95% CI 0.21–0.99) and 0.41 for exogenous hormone use (95% CI 0.19–0.87) were negatively associated. Subgroup analysis revealed ethnicity-based heterogeneity in these associations. Age at menarche, time since menopause, breastfeeding, and exogenous hormone use were associated with distal sensory polyneuropathy. Ethnicity significantly modified these associations."

Furthermore, humans residing in the DTMUV epidemic area display activated antiviral immune responses to local DTMUV isolates during the pathogenic invasion, thereby raising the primary concern that this flavivirus may be transmitted to humans via mosquito bites. Therefore, we identified the gene AALF004421, which is a homolog of the 34-kDa salivary protein (34 kDa) of Ae. albopictus and studied the salivary protein-mediated enhancement of DTMUV infection in Ae. albopictus salivary glands. We observed that double-stranded RNA-mediated silencing of the 34 kDa in mosquito salivary glands demonstrated that the silenced 34 kDa impaired DTMUV infectivity, similar to inhibition through serine protease. This impairment occurred as a consequence of triggering the innate immune response function of a macroglobulin complement-related factor (MCR). 34-kDa in the salivary gland which had similar activity as a serine protease, results in the abrogation of antimicrobial peptides production and strong enhance DTMUV replication and transmission. Although the function of the 34 kDa in Ae. albopictus is currently unknown; in the present study, we showed that it may have a major role in DTMUV infection in mosquito salivary glands through the suppression of the antiviral immune response in the earliest stages of infection. This finding provides the first identification of a prominently expressed 34 kDa protein in Ae. albopictus saliva that could serve as a target for controlling DTMUV replication in mosquito vectors."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Combination of genetically diverse Pseudomonas phages enhances the cocktail efficiency against bacteria  2023, The Author(s).Phage treatment has been used as an alternative to antibiotics since the early 1900s. However, bacteria may acquire phage resistance quickly, limiting the use of phage treatment. The combination of genetically diverse phages displaying distinct replication machinery in phage cocktails has therefore become a novel strategy to improve therapeutic outcomes. Here, we isolated and studied lytic phages (SPA01 and SPA05) that infect a wide range of clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. These relatively small myophages have around 93 kbp genomes with no undesirable genes, have a 30-min latent period, and reproduce a relatively high number of progenies, ranging from 218 to 240 PFU per infected cell. Even though both phages lyse their hosts within 4 h, phage-resistant bacteria emerge during the treatment. Considering SPA01-resistant bacteria cross-resist phage SPA05 and vice versa, combining SPA01 and SPA05 for a cocktail would be ineffective. According to the decreased adsorption rate of the phages in the resistant isolates, one of the anti-phage mechanisms may occur through modification of phage receptors on the target cells. All resistant isolates, however, are susceptible to nucleus-forming jumbophages (PhiKZ and PhiPA3), which are genetically distinct from phages SPA01 and SPA05, suggesting that the jumbophages recognize a different receptor during phage entry. The combination of these phages with the jumbophage PhiKZ outperforms other tested combinations in terms of bactericidal activity and effectively suppresses the emergence of phage resistance. This finding reveals the effectiveness of the diverse phage-composed cocktail for reducing bacterial growth and prolonging the evolution of phage resistance."

Dusit Zoo is a captive breeding facility where storks with phenotypically ambiguous patterns have recently been observed, and their status remaining inconclusive. Here, we used a combination of phenotypic characters and genetic markers (cytochrome b and 14 microsatellite markers) to distinguish and identify hybrids from the two parental species (n = 114). Haplotype analysis revealed asymmetric mtDNA introgression from M. cinerea to M. leucocephala, with twelve morphologically classified M. leucocephala individuals carrying heterospecific mtDNA. Comprehensive biparental genetic assessments identified 33% of all three genetic clusters as admixed individuals, of which most were either F2 hybrids, backcrosses with M. leucocephala, or hybrids of unknown generation, implying weak premating isolation with the absence of intrinsic postzygotic isolation between parentals. Morphological analysis demonstrated that the absence or indistinctness of a black bar across the breast is the most noticeable trait to identify these hybrids. The endangered M. cinerea was found to have genomic contamination from M. leucocephala and vice versa, with at least 41 hybrid individuals being identified. These findings provide critical information for detecting hybrids and identifying suitable breeding stocks with genetic purity for future reintroduction and conservation management."

Although the prevalence of malaria in macaque natural hosts has been investigated, their vectors remain unknown in this country. Herein, we performed a survey of Anopheles mosquitoes during rainy and dry seasons in Narathiwat Province, Southern Thailand. Altogether 367 Anopheles mosquitoes were captured for 40 nights during 18:00 to 06:00 h by using human-landing catches. Based on morphological and molecular identification, species composition comprised An. maculatus (37.06%), An. barbirostris s.l. (31.34%), An. latens (17.71%), An. introlatus (10.08%) and others (3.81%) including An. umbrosus s.l., An. minimus, An. hyrcanus s.l., An. aconitus, An. macarthuri and An. kochi. Analyses of individual mosquitoes by PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic inference of the mitochondrial cytochrome genes of both malaria parasites and mosquitoes have revealed that the salivary gland samples of An. latens harbored P. knowlesi (n = 1), P. inui (n = 2), P. fieldi (n = 1), P. coatneyi (n = 1), P. hylobati (n = 1) and an unnamed Plasmodium species known to infect both long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques (n = 2). The salivary glands of An. introlatus possessed P. cynomolgi (n = 1), P. inui (n = 1), P. hylobati (n = 1) and coexistence of P. knowlesi and P. inui (n = 1). An avian malaria parasite P. juxtanucleare has been identified in the salivary gland sample of An. latens. Three other distinct lineages of Plasmodium with phylogenetic affinity to avian malaria species were detected in An. latens, An. introlatus and An. macarthuri. Interestingly, the salivary gland sample of An. maculatus contained P. caprae, an ungulate malaria parasite known to infect domestic goats. Most infected mosquitoes harbored multiclonal Plasmodium infections. All Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes were captured during the first quarter of the night and predominantly occurred during rainy season. Since simian malaria in humans has a wide geographic distribution in Thailand, further studies in other endemic areas of the country are mandatory for understanding transmission and prevention of zoonotic malaria."

To obtain more effective treatment, the present study aimed to observe the effects of PL synergistically combined with Smilax corbularia and S. glabra extracts (PSS) on BC cell lines, MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468. Methods: The half-maximal inhibition (IC50) concentrations of PSS and PL were determined in a dose- and time-dependent manner using MTT assay. The activity of PSS and PL on anti-BC proliferation was evaluated using BrdU assay, and colony formation assay. Moreover, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis induction as a result of PSS and PL exposure were investigated using propidium iodide (PI) staining and co-staining of annexin V DY634 and PI combined flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Finally, changes in the mRNA expression of genes involved in proliferative and apoptotic pathways (MKI67, HER2, EGFR, MDM2, TNFα, PI3KCA, KRAS, BAX, and CASP8) were explored using RT-qPCR following PSS and PL treatment. Results: The PSS and PL extracts exhibited significant potential in BC cytotoxicity which were in were in dose- and time-dependent response. This inhibition of cell growth was due to the suppression of cell proliferation, the cell cycle arrest, and the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, an investigation of the underlying molecular mechanism revealed that PSS and PL are involved in downregulation of the MKI67, HER2, EGFR, MDM2, TNFα, and PI3KCA expression. Conclusions: This present study has suggested that PSS and PL possess anti-BC proliferative activity mediated via the downregulation of genes participating in the relevant pathways. PSS or PL may be combined with other agents to alleviate the adverse side effects resulted from conventional chemotherapeutic drugs."
['Complementary and Alternative Medicine'],"Structural modification of resveratrol analogue exhibits anticancer activity against lung cancer stem cells via suppression of Akt signaling pathway  2023, The Author(s).Background: Compound with cancer stem cell (CSC)-suppressing activity is promising for the improvement of lung cancer clinical outcomes. Toward this goal, we discovered the CSC-targeting activity of resveratrol (RES) analog moscatilin (MOS). With slight structural modification from RES, MOS shows dominant cytotoxicity and CSC-suppressive effect. Methods: Three human lung cancer cell lines, namely H23, H292, and A549, were used to compare the effects of RES and MOS. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by the MTT assay and Hoechst33342/PI double staining. Anti-proliferative activity was determined by colony formation assay and cell cycle analysis. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by fluorescence microscopy using DCFH2-DA staining. CSC-rich populations of A549 cells were generated, and CSC markers, and Akt signaling were determined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to predict the possible binding of the compound to Akt protein. Results: In this study, we evaluated the effects of RES and MOS on lung cancer and its anti-CSC potential. Compared with RES, its analog MOS more effectively inhibited cell viability, colony formation, and induced apoptosis in all lung cancer cell lines (H23, H292, and A549). We further investigated the anti-CSC effects on A549 CSC-rich populations and cancer adherent cells (A549 and H23). MOS possesses the ability to suppress CSC-like phenotype of lung cancer cells more potent than RES. Both MOS and RES repressed lung CSCs by inhibiting the viability, proliferation, and lung CSC-related marker CD133. However, only MOS inhibits the CSC marker CD133 in both CSC-rich population and adherent cells. Mechanistically, MOS exerted its anti-CSC effects by inhibiting Akt and consequently restored the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and decreased the pluripotent transcription factors (Sox2 and c-Myc). Thus, MOS inhibits CSC-like properties through the repression of the Akt/GSK-3β/c-Myc pathway. Moreover, the superior inhibitory effects of MOS compared to RES were associated with the improved activation of various mechanism, such as cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, production of ROS-mediated apoptosis, and inhibition of Akt activation. Notably, the computational analysis confirmed the strong interaction between MOS and Akt protein. MD simulations revealed that the binding between MOS and Akt1 was more stable than RES, with MM/GBSA binding free energy of − 32.8245 kcal/mol at its allosteric site. In addition, MOS interacts with Trp80 and Tyr272, which was a key residue in allosteric inhibitor binding and can potentially alter Akt activity. Conclusions: Knowledge about the effect of MOS as a CSC-targeting compound and its interaction with Akt is important for the development of drugs for the treatment of CSC-driven cancer including lung cancer."

Calcium carbonate, which is manufactured from limestone, is one of the substrates of tricalcium silicate. To avoid the environmental impact of mining, calcium carbonate can be obtained from biological sources, such as shelled mollusks, one of which is cockle shell. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the chemical, physical, and biological properties of a newly developed bioceramic cement derived from cockle shell (BioCement) with those of a commercial tricalcium silicate cement (Biodentine). Methods: BioCement was prepared from cockle shells and rice husk ash and its chemical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The physical properties were evaluated following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9917-1;2007 and 6876;2012. The pH was tested after 3 h to 8 weeks. The biological properties were assessed using extraction medium from BioCement and Biodentine on human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) in vitro. The 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2 H-tetrazolium hydroxide assay was used to evaluate cell cytotoxicity following ISO 10993-5;2009. Cell migration was examined using a wound healing assay. Alizarin red staining was performed to detect osteogenic differentiation. The data were tested for a normal distribution. Once confirmed, the physical properties and pH data were analyzed using the independent t-test, and the biological property data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. Results: The main components of BioCement and Biodentine were calcium and silicon. BioCement’s and Biodentine’s setting time and compressive strength were not different. The radiopacity of BioCement and Biodentine was 5.00 and 3.92 mmAl, respectively (p < 0.05). BioCement’s solubility was significantly higher than Biodentine. Both materials exhibited alkalinity (pH ranged from 9 to 12) and demonstrated > 90% cell viability with cell proliferation. The highest mineralization was found in the BioCement group at 7 days (p < 0.05). Conclusions: BioCement exhibited acceptable chemical and physical properties and was biocompatible to human dental pulp cells. BioCement promotes pulp cell migration and osteogenic differentiation."

It is characterized by inflammatory fibro-obliteration of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Although the restoration of bile flow can be successful after Kasai operation, the rapid progression of liver fibrosis can continue, leading to cirrhosis. It is believed that the progression of liver fibrosis in BA is exacerbated by complicated mechanisms other than the consequence of bile duct obstruction. The fibrogenic cascade in BA liver can be divided into three stages, including liver inflammatory injury, myofibroblast activation, and fibrous scar formation. Recent studies have revealed that the activation of an immune response following bile duct injury plays an important role in promoting the inflammatory process, the releasing of inflammatory cytokines, and the development of fibrogenesis in BA liver. In this article, we summarized the evidence regarding liver inflammatory injury and the possible mechanisms that explain the rapid progression of liver fibrosis in BA."

Kutzneria, a rare actinobacteria belonging to the family Pseudonocardiaceae has abundance of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and is one of important source of natural products and worthy of priority investigation. Currently, Kutzneria chonburiensis SMC256T has been the latest type-strain of the genus and its genome sequence has not been reported yet. Therefore, we present the first report of new complete genome sequence of SMC256T (genome size of 10.4 Mbp) with genome annotation and feature comparison between SMC256T and other publicly available Kutzneria species. The results from comparative and functional genomic analyses regarding the phylogenomic and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) analyses indicated that SMC256T is most closely related to Kutzneria sp. 744, Kutzneria kofuensis, Kutzneria sp. CA-103260 and Kutzneria buriramensis. Furthermore, a total of 322 BGCs were also detected and showed diversity among the Kutzneria genomes. Out of which, 38 clusters showing the best hit to the most known BGCs were predicted in the SMC256Tgenome. We observed that six clusters responsible for biosynthesis of antimicrobials/antitumor metabolites were strain-specific in Kutzneria chonburiensis. These putative metabolites include virginiamycin S1, lysolipin I, esmeraldin, rakicidin, aclacinomycin and streptoseomycin. Based on these findings, the genome of Kutzneria chonburiensis contains distinct and unidentified BGCs different from other members of the genus, and the use of integrative genomic-based approach would be a useful alternative effort to target, isolate and identify putative and undiscovered secondary metabolites suspected to have new and/or specific bioactivity in the Kutzneria."

It is known primarily as an anti-hyperglycemic drug that has become the main oral blood-glucose-lowering medication for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus globally. Its use has been reported in a variety of oral conditions and dentistry in general. Recent clinical trials have indicated the effectiveness of adjunct topical application of metformin in improving the periodontal parameters of patients with diabetes and periodontitis. Additionally, studies have suggested that metformin stimulates odontogenic differentiation and mineral synthesis of stem cells in the tooth pulp. Metformin also stimulates osteoblast proliferation, decreases osteoclast activity and exerts regenerative effects on periodontal bone, thus making it a viable candidate for periodontal regeneration. Metformin monotherapy significantly enhances osseointegration of endosseous implants and has been reported to have anti-cancer effects on oral squamous cell carcinoma by impeding tumor progression. Animal studies have indicated that metformin improves orthodontic tooth movement and resists orthodontic appliance corrosion. This narrative review aims to provide a current summary of research highlighting the prospective uses of metformin in dentistry."

Nevertheless, there has been little synthesis of the strength and quality of this evidence in aggregate. Methods: To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of RCTs that assessed the association of KD, ketogenic low-carbohydrate high-fat diet (K-LCHF), and very low-calorie KD (VLCKD) with health outcomes, PubMed, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched up to February 15, 2023. Meta-analyses of RCTs of KD were included. Meta-analyses were re-performed using a random-effects model. The quality of evidence per association provided in meta-analyses was rated by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) criteria as high, moderate, low, and very low. Results: We included 17 meta-analyses comprising 68 RCTs (median [interquartile range, IQR] sample size of 42 [20–104] participants and follow-up period of 13 [8–36] weeks) and 115 unique associations. There were 51 statistically significant associations (44%) of which four associations were supported by high-quality evidence (reduced triglyceride (n = 2), seizure frequency (n = 1) and increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (n = 1)) and four associations supported by moderate-quality evidence (decrease in body weight, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), hemoglobin A1c, and increased total cholesterol). The remaining associations were supported by very low (26 associations) to low (17 associations) quality evidence. In overweight or obese adults, VLCKD was significantly associated with improvement in anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes without worsening muscle mass, LDL-C, and total cholesterol. K-LCHF was associated with reduced body weight and body fat percentage, but also reduced muscle mass in healthy participants. Conclusions: This umbrella review found beneficial associations of KD supported by moderate to high-quality evidence on seizure and several cardiometabolic parameters. However, KD was associated with a clinically meaningful increase in LDL-C. Clinical trials with long-term follow-up are warranted to investigate whether the short-term effects of KD will translate to beneficial effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality."
['Health Policy'],"Impact of prescription length supply policy on patient medication adherence in Thailand  2023, The Author(s).Background: Phramongkutklao Hospital is one of the largest military hospitals in Thailand. Beginning in 2016, an institutional policy was implemented in which medication prescription length was increased from 30 to 90 days. However, there have been no formal investigations into how this policy has impacted medication adherence among patients in hospitals. As such, this study evaluated how prescription length impacted medication adherence among dyslipidemia and type-2 diabetes patients who were treated at Phramongkutklao Hospital. Methods: This pre-post implementation study compared patients who received prescription lengths of 30 and 90 days based on information recorded in the hospital database between 2014 and 2017. Therein, we used the medication possession ratio (MPR) to estimate patient adherence. Focusing on patients with universal coverage insurance, we employed the difference-in-difference method to examine changes in adherence from before and after policy implementation, then conducted a logistic regression to test for associations between the predictors and adherence. Results: We analyzed data from a total of 2,046 patients, with equal amounts of 1,023 placed into the control group (no change to 90-day prescription length) and intervention group (change from 30 to 90-day prescription length). First, we found that increased prescription length was associated with 4% and 5% higher MPRs among dyslipidemia and diabetes patients in the intervention group, respectively. Second, we found that medication adherence was correlated with sex, comorbidities, history of hospitalization, and the number of prescribed medications. Conclusion: Increasing the prescription length from 30 to 90 days improved medication adherence in both the dyslipidemia and type-2 diabetes patients. This shows that the policy change was successful for patients in the hospital considered for this study."

Despite being a common disorder, acute pancreatitis lacks a specific treatment. The present study aimed to examine the effects of probiotics on pancreatic inflammation and intestinal integrity in mice with acute pancreatitis. Methods: Male ICR mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 6 per group). The control group received two intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of normal saline as a vehicle control. The acute pancreatitis (AP) group received two i.p. injections of L-arginine 450 mg/100 g body weight. AP plus probiotics groups received L-arginine to induce acute pancreatitis as above. In the single-strain and mixed-strain groups, mice received 1 mL of Lactobacillus plantarum B7 1 × 108 CFU/mL and 1 mL of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 1 × 108 CFU/mL and Lactobacillus paracasei B13 1 × 108 CFU/mL by oral gavage, respectively for 6 days starting 3 days prior to the AP induction. All mice were sacrificed 72 h after L-arginine injection. Pancreatic tissue was obtained for histological evaluation and immunohistochemical studies for myeloperoxidase, whereas ileal tissue was used for immunohistochemical studies for occludin, and claudin-1. Blood samples were collected for amylase analysis. Results: Serum amylase levels and pancreatic myeloperoxidase levels in the AP group were significantly higher than in controls and significantly decreased in probiotic groups compared with the AP group. Ileal occludin and claudin-1 levels were significantly lower in the AP group than in controls. Ileal occludin levels significantly increased, whereas ileal claudin-1 levels did not significantly change in both probiotic groups as compared with the AP group. The pancreatic histopathology showed significantly higher degree of inflammation, edema, and fat necrosis in the AP group, and these changes improved in mixed-strained probiotic groups. Conclusions: Probiotics, particularly the mixed-strain ones, attenuated AP via the reduction of inflammation and the maintenance of intestinal integrity."

Pregnant women at gestational age 11–13+6 weeks, who visited the antenatal clinic at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University during April 2020–July 2021 were included. Serum HtrA4 levels and transabdominal uterine artery Doppler ultrasound were performed to evaluate this combination for calculating the predictive value of preeclampsia. While 371 singleton pregnant women enrolled in this study, 366 completed it. Thirty-four (9.3%) women had preeclampsia. Mean serum HtrA4 levels were higher in the preeclampsia group than in the control group (9.4 ± 3.9 vs 4.6 ± 2.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001). The mean uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI) was higher in the group with early onset preeclampsia than in the control group (2.3 ± 0.5 vs 1.7 ± 0.5, p = 0.002). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 76.5%, 90.7%, 45.6%, and 97.4%, respectively, when using serum HtrA4 levels above 1.8 multiples of the median for the gestational age as a cut-off value for predicting preeclampsia. A combination of serum HtrA4 levels and UtA-PI > 95th percentile yielded sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 79.4%, 86.1%, 37% and 97.6%, respectively, for the prediction of preeclampsia. A combination of serum HtrA4 levels and uterine artery Doppler in the first trimester had good sensitivity for predicting preeclampsia."

"['Food Animals', 'Animal Science and Zoology']","Bacteriospermia and its antimicrobial resistance in relation to boar sperm quality during short-term storage with or without antibiotics in a tropical environment  2023, The Author(s).Background: In tropical environments, boar semen is prepared either from a boar on the same farm as the sow herd or collected in semen collection centers and then transported to other farms. Thus, the semen doses can be used for artificial insemination either immediately or preserved for 2–3 days. The present study investigated the bacteriospermia and its antimicrobial resistance in relation to boar sperm quality during short-term storage in semen extender with or without antibiotics in Thailand. M&M: In total, 20 Duroc ejaculates were collected. Each ejaculate was diluted in Beltsville Thawing Solution extender either with 0.25 g of gentamicin per liter (ANTIBIOTIC) or without gentamicin (NO-ANITIBIOTIC) to create semen doses containing 3,000 × 106 sperm/100 mL. These were stored at 17 °C for 4 days. Semen characteristics and total bacterial count (CFU per mL, log10) were measured after collection and during storage. Results: Sperm viability was decreased by 6.4% for every 1.0 log10 increase in total bacterial count (p = 0.026) and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated across ejaculates. Throughout the 4 days of storage, sperm motility, viability and acrosome integrity in the ANTIBIOTIC group were higher than those in the NO-ANTIBIOTIC group (p < 0.05), while the total bacterial count was lower (1.9 ± 0.1 versus 3.9 ± 0.1 log10, respectively; p < 0.001). Without antibiotic supplementation, the total numbers of bacteria counted on days 2 and 3 of storage were higher than those determined on days 0 and 1 (p < 0.001). Differences in semen quality were detected on days 2 and 3 between the NO-ANTIBIOTIC and ANTIBIOTIC groups in high-viability semen (p < 0.05). However, no differences in sperm quality between the NO-ANTIBIOTIC and ANTIBIOTIC groups were detected in the low-viability semen on each storage day (p > 0.05). On the last day of preservation, Globicatella sanguinis (57.2%), Delftia acidovorans (18.9%) and Micrococcus spp. (5.9%) remained as the top three most abundant contaminants in the semen with antibiotic. Conclusion: Our findings contribute new insights toward reducing antibiotics as well as rational antibiotic use in the boar AI industry. The growth of bacteria was significantly greater only after 2 days of preservation in the semen without antibiotic. For semen doses diluted from highly viable ejaculates, it is possible to store for 2 days without any antibiotic supplementation. Moreover, bacterial counts increased at the end of storage in the presence of gentamycin, suggesting the loss of bacteriostatic properties of gentamicin to the growth of bacteria during storage."
"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","Trends of cannabis use and related harms before and after legalization for recreational purpose in a developing country in Asia  2023, The Author(s).Background: Thailand was the first country in Asia to legalize the use and purchase of cannabis leaves in February 2021 and the whole plant in June 2022 after the 2019 allowance for medical purposes. The study explored trends in cannabis use in Thailand before and after the recreational cannabis allowance was imposed. Methods: Cannabis and other variables of substance use, cannabis use disorder, and attitude towards cannabis of the Thai population aged 18 to 65 years in 2019 (n = 5,002), 2020 (n = 5,389) and 2021 (n = 5,669) were obtained from annual surveys conducted in the last two months of each year by the Centre for Addiction Studies. The surveys were repeat cross-sectional surveys of the general population of Thailand. Repeated variables from at least two annual surveys were included for analysis using the Chi-square test and the t-test. Results: The prevalence of cannabis use in the past year had increased from 2.2% in 2019 to 2.5% and 4.2% in 2020 and 2021 respectively, while those of methamphetamine, alcohol, and tobacco use had decreased. Trends in past-year drinking/eating cannabis products had increased, especially among the middle age group (40–49 years) from 2.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 3.1) in 2019 and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6, 1.9) in 2020 to 3.8% (95% CI: 2.8, 5.0) in 2021. The younger population aged 18–19 had an increase in cannabis smoking from 0.9% (95% CI: 0.1, 3.3) in 2019 to 2.0% (95% CI: 0.5, 5.1) and 2.2% (95% CI: 0.7, 5.1) in 2020 and 2021 respectively. Symptoms of cannabis use disorder among cannabis users increased from 2019 to 2020 and then reversed afterwards in 2021. Thais had greater health knowledge about the benefits and harms of cannabis and had attitudes toward more harm of cannabis in 2021; however, 35.6% or a third of the sample in 2021 truly believed that cannabis was a cure for cancer, and 23.2% or one-fourth were uncertain or did not believe that cannabis was addictive. Conclusions: Although most of the substances had a lower prevalence of use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand, cannabis had a higher use after legalization. Thai youth had a growing trend to smoke cannabis."

Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of a light emitting diode (LED) toothbrush with a manual toothbrush in reducing dental plaque and gingival inflammation in orthodontic patients with fixed appliances, and to investigate the effect of the LED toothbrush on Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilm in vitro. Methods: Twenty-four orthodontic patients were recruited and randomly assigned into 2 groups: (1) started with manual and (2) started with LED toothbrushes. After a 28-day usage and 28-day wash-out period, the patients switched to the other intervention. The plaque and gingival indices were determined at baseline and 28 days after each intervention. The patients’ compliance and satisfaction scores were collected using questionnaires. For the in vitro experiments, S. mutans biofilm was divided into 5 groups (n = 6) with 15-, 30-, 60-, or 120-sec LED exposure, and without LED exposure as a control group. Results: There was no significant difference in the gingival index between the manual and LED toothbrush groups. The manual toothbrush was significantly more effective in reducing the plaque index in the proximal area on the bracket side (P = 0.031). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in other areas around the brackets or on the non-bracket side. After LED exposure in vitro, the percentages of bacterial viability after LED exposure for 15–120 s were significantly lower compared with the control (P = 0.006). Conclusion: Clinically, the LED toothbrush was not more effective in reducing dental plaque or gingival inflammation than the manual toothbrush in orthodontic patients with fixed appliances. However, the blue light from the LED toothbrush significantly reduced the number of S. mutans in biofilm when it was exposed to the light for at least 15 s in vitro.

Its TEER reduction was corresponded to increased FD4 transport across the monolayers and disrupted localization of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin at the cell borders. 600-HPTChC65 was densely localized at the membrane surface and intercellular junctions. This chitosan (0.08–0.32% w/v) reduced the efflux ratio of [3H]-digoxin by 1.7- 2 folds, suggesting an increased [3H]-digoxin transport across the monolayers. Its binding with P-gp on Caco-2 monolayer increased the signal of fluorescence-labeled anti-P-gp (UIC2) reactivity due to conformational change. 600-HPTChC65 (0.32% w/v) had no effect on P-gp expression in the Caco-2 monolayers. These results suggest that 600-HPTChC65 could enhance drug absorption through tight junction opening and decreased P-gp function. Its interaction with the absorptive barrier mainly resulted in disrupting ZO-1 and occludin organization as well as changing in P-gp conformation."

Peroxisomal disorders represent a class of medical conditions caused by deficiencies in peroxisome function and are segmented into enzyme-and-transporter defects (defects in single peroxisomal proteins) and peroxisome biogenesis disorders (defects in the peroxin proteins, critical for normal peroxisome assembly and biogenesis). In this study, we employed multivariate supervised and non-supervised statistical methods and utilized mass spectrometry data of neurological patients, peroxisomal disorder patients (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome), and healthy controls to analyze the role of common metabolites in peroxisomal disorders, to develop and refine a classification models of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome, and to explore analytes with utility in rapid screening and diagnostics. Results: T-SNE, PCA, and (sparse) PLS-DA, operated on mass spectrometry data of patients and healthy controls were utilized in this study. The performance of exploratory PLS-DA models was assessed to determine a suitable number of latent components and variables to retain for sparse PLS-DA models. Reduced-features (sparse) PLS-DA models achieved excellent classification performance of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome patients. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated metabolic differences between healthy controls, neurological patients, and peroxisomal disorder (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome) patients, refined classification models and showed the potential utility of hexacosanoylcarnitine (C26:0-carnitine) as a screening analyte for Chinese patients in the context of a multivariate discriminant model predictive of peroxisomal disorders."
['Dentistry (all)'],"Trehalose versus carboxymethylcellulose oral spray for relieving radiation-induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial  2023, The Author(s).Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of trehalose oral spray to relieve radiation-induced xerostomia on a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Prior to RCT, the effect of trehalose (5–20%) on the epithelial growth of fetal mouse salivary gland (SG) explants was evaluated to confirm if 10% trehalose exerted the best epithelial outcomes. Participants who completed radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment were enrolled in a double-blind RCT, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria as per the CONSORT statement. The experimental group (n = 35) received 10% trehalose spray, while the control group (n = 35) received carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) spray to apply intra-orally 4 times/day for 14 days. Salivary pH and unstimulated salivary flow rate were recorded pre- and post-interventions. The Xerostomia-related Quality of Life scale (XeQoLs) was filled, and scores assessed post-interventions. Results: In the SG explant model, pro-acinar epithelial growth and mitosis was supported by 10% topical trehalose. As for RCT outcomes, salivary pH and unstimulated salivary flow rate were significantly improved after use of 10% trehalose spray when compared to CMC (p < 0.05). Participants reported an improvement of XeQoLs dimension scores after using trehalose or CMC oral sprays in terms of physical, pain/discomfort, and psychological dimensions (p < 0.05), but not social (p > 0.05). When comparing between CMC and trehalose sprays, XeQoLs total scores were not statistically different (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The 10% trehalose spray improved salivary pH, unstimulated salivary flow rate, and the quality-of-life dimensions linked with physical, pain/discomfort, and psychological signs. The clinical efficacy of 10% trehalose spray was equivalent with CMC-based saliva substitutes for relieving radiation-induced xerostomia; therefore, trehalose may be suggested in alternative to CMC-based oral spray.(Thai Clinical Trials Registry; https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/ TCTR20190817004)."

Factor VIII deficiency is responsible for hemophilia A while factor IX deficiency is responsible for hemophilia B. As per the 2020 annual global survey by the World Federation of Hemophilia, only 1828 Thai hemophiliacs have been registered to the national healthcare system. The reason for the low number is the underdiagnosis which is a major concern in the real-world practice among Asian countries. In Thailand, most hemophiliacs are diagnosed by general practitioners, pediatricians or internists at rural hospitals and are referred to hemophilia specialists at the Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs). Despite the challenges pertaining to infrastructure and cost of treatment, Thailand has progressed substantially in providing the required hemophilia care, as evidenced by an evolution in acquiring and sharing knowledge as well as collaborative efforts among multiple stakeholders over the past three decades. In this letter-to-the-editor, the authors have summarized the practices for and challenges faced with hemophilia management in Thailand."

Eight Thiel’s embalmed paired cadaveric knees from four cadavers were dissected. The specimens were assigned to undergo ACL repair either with cortical suspensory button or with knotless anchor suture. The Instron machine replicates cyclic loading and then determines the gap formation. Traction was applied until failure. The load-to-failure, stiffness, and modes of failure in both groups were recorded. The load-to-failure, stiffness, and gap formation were compared between the two groups using the student's t-test. The mean load-to-failure in the cortical suspensory button group was significantly higher than the knotless anchor suture group (212.96 ± 54.57 vs 44.57 ± 20.80, p value < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was found regarding gap formation following cyclic loading and stiffness between the cortical suspensory button group and the knotless anchor suture group. This biomechanical study showed a higher load-to-failure for the ACL repair with cortical suspensory button compared to ACL repair with knotless anchor suture, while no statistically significant difference was found regarding the gap formation following cyclic loading and the stiffness. The load-to-failure in both cortical suspensory button and knotless anchor suture are below regular daily activity load.

However, bleeding, the main side effect, is associated with prolonged hospitalization and mortality. Therefore, assessment of the incidence of bleeding and associated risk factors is crucial in developing an appropriate treatment plan to prevent bleeding. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with ACS admitted to a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand between 2011 and 2015 and received enoxaparin. To estimate the incidence of bleeding events, patients were followed up for 30 days from the first enoxaparin dose. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with bleeding events. Results: From a total of 602 patients, the incidence of bleeding was 15.8%, of which 5.7% involved major bleeding. The risk factors for any form of bleeding were aged at least 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 3.36), history of bleeding (OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.24 to 11.55), and history of oral anticoagulant exposure (OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.74 to 12.86). Conclusion: ACS patients treated with enoxaparin had an increased risk of bleeding if they were aged 65 years or older, had a history of bleeding events, and had a history of taking oral anticoagulants."

However, the relevance of this cell model for AD pathogenesis and preclinical drug screening remains to be more elucidated. While there is increasing use of this cell model in a number of studies, relatively little is known about its underlying molecular signatures in relation to AD. Here, our RNA sequencing study provides the first transcriptomic and network analyses of HT22 cells following glutamate exposure. Several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their relationships specific to AD were identified. Additionally, the usefulness of this cell model as a drug screening system was assessed by determining the expression of those AD-associated DEGs in response to two medicinal plant extracts, Acanthus ebracteatus and Streblus asper, that have been previously shown to be protective in this cell model. In summary, the present study reports newly identified AD-specific molecular signatures in glutamate-injured HT22 cells, suggesting that this cell can be a valuable model system for the screening and evaluation of new anti-AD agents, particularly from natural products."

Materials and methods: This crossover study comprised three phases. Phase I, prisoner health volunteers (PHVs) enrolled teledentistry training for an intraoral camera (IOC) use. Phase II, the PHV used IOC for examining dental diseases of prisoners who reported dental-related problems, and captured symptomatic areas. The PHV and dentist independently determined tentative dental treatment need, comprising dental fillings, scaling, extraction, and surgical removal of impacted tooth. Phase III, another dentist performed direct oral examination of the prisoners who reported problems in phase II and determined dental treatment needs. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated, using direct oral examination by dentist as a true positive. Results: Diagnostic accuracy was determined in 152 prisoners with 215 teeth. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of teledentistry and direct examination between two dentists were above 80%. The lowest sensitivity and specificity of teledentistry examination by the PHV were scaling and surgical removal. Conclusions: IOC use in teledentistry facilitates dentists in dental diseases screening for prisoners with acceptable diagnostic accuracy in identifying possible treatment needs. However, the imaging obtained from teledentistry is not adequate to accurately identify all dental treatment needs."

However, the roles of mTORC2 in the migrational control process have not been entirely elucidated. Here, we elaborate that active mTORC2 is crucial for GBM cell motility. Inhibition of mTORC2 impaired cell movement and negatively affected microfilament and microtubule functions. We also aimed to characterize important players involved in the regulation of cell migration and other mTORC2-mediated cellular processes in GBM cells. Therefore, we quantitatively characterized the alteration of the mTORC2 interactome under selective conditions using affinity purification-mass spectrometry in glioblastoma. We demonstrated that changes in cell migration ability specifically altered mTORC2-associated proteins. GSN was identified as one of the most dynamic proteins. The mTORC2-GSN linkage was mostly highlighted in high-grade glioma cells, connecting functional mTORC2 to multiple proteins responsible for directional cell movement in GBM. Loss of GSN disconnected mTORC2 from numerous cytoskeletal proteins and affected the membrane localization of mTORC2. In addition, we reported 86 stable mTORC2-interacting proteins involved in diverse molecular functions, predominantly cytoskeletal remodeling, in GBM. Our findings might help expand future opportunities for predicting the highly migratory phenotype of brain cancers in clinical investigations."
['Medicine (miscellaneous)'],"Comparing mixed oil to soybean oil lipid emulsion in patients on home parenteral nutrition: a pilot prospective double-blind, crossover, randomized trial  2023, The Author(s).Background: Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) can be associated with increased liver enzymes, catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), and hospitalizations. Mixed oil (MO) versus soybean oil (SO) lipid emulsion reduces risks in hospitalized patients, but there are no randomized double-blinded controlled trials in HPN. Therefore, the primary objective was to test the study’s feasibility such as recruitment and retention in the HPN population and the secondary objective was to assess changes in liver enzymes between MO and SO as well as other clinical and biochemical outcomes. Methods: This 13-month prospective double-blind crossover randomized pilot trial took place in Toronto, Canada. Participants were HPN patients who were a part of the HPN program at Toronto General Hospital. We recruited patients from the HPN program. HPN patients receiving SO were randomized to either MO or SO, and the study duration was 6 months in each arm (MO or SO) with a 1-month washout period resuming SO. As this is a crossover trial design, the patient is his/her own control. The main outcome measures were descriptions of study feasibility, namely the study recruitment and retention. We also collected biochemical parameters, CRSBI, hospitalization rate, antibiotic use, and mortality. Demographic, nutritional, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months of each arm. The primary analysis population was defined as the per-protocol population who completed the trial including all lipid measurements. Results: A total of 65 HPN patients were assessed, and 60 met the inclusion criteria for the study. Thirty-five percent (21/60) were randomized using a computer-generated random number sequence generator: 10 participants were randomized to receive SO first while 11 were randomized to receive MO first. At 13 months, 3/10 who received SO first completed the study, whereas 9/11 who received MO first completed the study. This did not meet our a priori criteria for success in recruitment and retention. Between types of lipid emulsions, there were no significant differences in changes in liver enzymes or biochemical and clinical outcomes, despite significant changes in plasma free fatty acid composition reflecting MO or SO. Conclusions: Overall, this pilot trial demonstrated that the use of a prospective double-blind, crossover, randomized trial design was not feasible to conduct in the HPN population because of difficulties in recruiting and retaining patients. In addition, there was no significant impact of MO versus SO lipid emulsion on liver enzymes or most parameters. The lack of significance may be attributed to low sample size from low recruitment and high drop-out rate, short study duration (6 months/arm), and complex care. In a future definitive trial, a multicenter study of longer duration and a larger sample size is recommended, and drop-outs may be reduced by using a parallel study design.

['Multidisciplinary'],"Identification of a novel gut microbiota signature associated with colorectal cancer in Thai population  2023, The Author(s).Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Dysbiosis of human gut microbiota has been linked to sporadic CRC. This study aimed to compare the gut microbiota profiles of 80 Thai volunteers over 50 years of age among 25 CRC patients, 33 patients with adenomatous polyp, and 22 healthy controls. The 16S rRNA sequencing was utilized to characterize the gut microbiome in both mucosal tissue and stool samples. The results revealed that the luminal microbiota incompletely represented the intestinal bacteria at the mucus layer. The mucosal microbiota in beta diversity differed significantly among the three groups. The stepwise increase of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides according to the adenomas–carcinomas sequence was found. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis effect size showed a higher level of Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum (ER), an opportunistic pathogen in the immunocompromised host, in both sample types of CRC patients. These findings indicated that the imbalance of intestinal microorganisms might involve in CRC tumorigenesis. Additionally, absolute quantitation of bacterial burden by quantitative real–time PCR (qPCR) confirmed the increasing ER levels in both sample types of cancer cases. Using ER as a stool–based biomarker for CRC detection by qPCR could predict CRC in stool samples with a specificity of 72.7% and a sensitivity of 64.7%. These results suggested ER might be a potential noninvasive marker for CRC screening development. However, a larger sample size is required to validate this candidate biomarker in diagnosing CRC."

Here, we describe the preclinical studies of “ChulaCov19”, a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA encoding prefusion-unstabilized ectodomain spike protein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). In female BALB/c mice, ChulaCov19 at 0.2, 1, 10, and 30 μg elicits robust neutralizing antibody (NAb) and T cell responses in a dose-dependent relationship. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of NAb against wild-type (WT, Wuhan-Hu1) virus are 1,280, 11,762, 54,047, and 62,084, respectively. Higher doses induce better cross-NAb against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.4/5) variants. This elicited immunogenicity is significantly higher than those induced by homologous CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccination. In a heterologous prime-boost study, ChulaCov19 booster dose generates a 7-fold increase of NAb against Wuhan-Hu1 WT virus and also significantly increases NAb response against Omicron (BA.1 and BA.4/5) when compared to homologous CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccination. Challenge studies show that ChulaCov19 protects human-ACE-2-expressing female mice from COVID-19 symptoms, prevents viremia and significantly reduces tissue viral load. Moreover, anamnestic NAb response is undetectable in challenge animals. ChulaCov19 is therefore a promising mRNA vaccine candidate either as a primary or boost vaccination and has entered clinical development."
['Dentistry (all)'],"Tooth agenesis patterns and variants in PAX9: A systematic review  2023 The AuthorsMutations in PAX9 are the most common genetic cause of tooth agenesis (TA). The aim of this study was to systematically review the profiles of the TA and PAX9 variants and establish their genotype-phenotype correlation. Forty articles were eligible for 178 patients and 61 mutations (26 in frame and 32 null mutations). PAX9 mutations predominantly affected molars, mostly the second molar, and the mandibular first premolar was the least affected. More missing teeth were found in the maxilla than the mandible, and with null mutations than in-frame mutations. The number of missing teeth was correlated with the locations of the in-frame mutations with the C-terminus mutations demonstrating the fewest missing teeth. The null mutation location did not influence the number of missing teeth. Null mutations in all locations predominantly affected molars. For the in-frame mutations, a missing second molar was commonly associated with mutations in the highly conserved paired DNA-binding domain, particularly the linking peptide (100% prevalence). In contrast, C-terminus mutations were rarely associated with missing second molars and anterior teeth, but were commonly related to an absent second premolar. These finding indicate that the mutation type and position contribute to different degrees of loss of PAX9 function that further differentially influences the manifestations of TA. This study provides novel information on the correlation of the PAX9 genotype-phenotype, aiding in the genetic counseling for TA."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Feature-based attention warps the perception of visual features  2023, The Author(s).Selective attention improves sensory processing of relevant information but can also impact the quality of perception. For example, attention increases visual discrimination performance and at the same time boosts apparent stimulus contrast of attended relative to unattended stimuli. Can attention also lead to perceptual distortions of visual representations? Optimal tuning accounts of attention suggest that processing is biased towards “off-tuned” features to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in favor of the target, especially when targets and distractors are confusable. Here, we tested whether such tuning gives rise to phenomenological changes of visual features. We instructed participants to select a color among other colors in a visual search display and subsequently asked them to judge the appearance of the target color in a 2-alternative forced choice task. Participants consistently judged the target color to appear more dissimilar from the distractor color in feature space. Critically, the magnitude of these perceptual biases varied systematically with the similarity between target and distractor colors during search, indicating that attentional tuning quickly adapts to current task demands. In control experiments we rule out possible non-attentional explanations such as color contrast or memory effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that selective attention warps the representational geometry of color space, resulting in profound perceptual changes across large swaths of feature space. Broadly, these results indicate that efficient attentional selection can come at a perceptual cost by distorting our sensory experience."
['Dentistry (all)'],"Novel ITGB6 variants cause hypoplastic-hypomineralized amelogenesis imperfecta and taurodontism: characterization of tooth phenotype and review of literature  2023, The Author(s).Objectives: To characterize phenotype and genotype of amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) in a Thai patient, and review of literature. Materials and methods: Variants were identified using trio-exome and Sanger sequencing. The ITGB6 protein level in patient’s gingival cells was measured. The patient’s deciduous first molar was investigated for surface roughness, mineral density, microhardness, mineral composition, and ultrastructure. Results: The patient exhibited hypoplastic-hypomineralized AI, taurodontism, and periodontal inflammation. Exome sequencing identified the novel compound heterozygous ITGB6 mutation, a nonsense c.625 G > T, p.(Gly209*) inherited from mother and a splicing c.1661-3 C > G from father, indicating AI type IH. The ITGB6 level in patient cells was significantly reduced, compared with controls. Analyses of a patient’s tooth showed a significant increase in roughness while mineral density of enamel and microhardness of enamel and dentin were significantly reduced. In dentin, carbon was significantly decreased while calcium, phosphorus, and oxygen levels were significantly increased. Severely collapsed enamel rods and a gap in dentinoenamel junction were observed. Of six affected families and eight ITGB6 variants that have been reported, our patient was the only one with taurodontism. Conclusion: We report the hypoplasia/hypomineralization/taurodontism AI patient with disturbed tooth characteristics associated with the novel ITGB6 variants and reduced ITGB6 expression, expanding genotype, phenotype, and understanding of autosomal recessive AI."

Synthesis was followed by aza-Michael addition reaction, where the acrylonitrile accepts an electron pair from the respective amines and results in the formation of n-alkyliminobis-propionitrile and n-alkyliminopropionitrile under microwave irradiation. Characterization of the compounds were performed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) and Electrospray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ESI–MS). The particle size characterization was done by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique. The antibacterial study showed higher inhibition rate for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial ability was found to be dose dependent. The minimum inhibitory concentration against both bacteria were found to be 1, 3, 0.4, 1, 3 µl/ml for E. coli and 6, 6, 0.9, 0.5, 5 µl/ml for B. subtilis. Time-kill kinetics evaluation showed that the adducts possess bacteriostatic action. Further it was evaluated for high-throughput in vitro assays to determine the compatibility of the adducts for drug delivery. The haemolytic and thrombolytic activity was analysed against normal mouse erythrocytes. The haemolytic activity showed prominent results, and thereby projecting this acrylonitrile adducts as potent antimicrobial and haemolytic agent."

Most specifications for ready-mixed concrete address limits on discharge time and truck-drum revolution counts. These limits have been developed for conventional concrete. As the uses of supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) become ubiquitous, it is important to determine whether these specifications are applicable to SCMs, that is, systems containing fly ash. This paper presents results of the effects of mixing time and mixer revolution counts on characteristics of lab-made pastes and mortars containing 20% and 50% fly ash. Their characteristics assessed include time-variant ion concentrations, setting time, flow, compressive strength, porosity, and apparent chloride diffusivity coefficient. Results indicate that with increasing mixing time and mixer revolution counts, mixtures with a replacement of fly ash exhibit improved both fresh and hardened characteristics. When mixed for 60 min or 25,505 revolution count, the 28-day compressive strengths of mixtures containing 20% and 50% fly ash are 50% to 100% higher than the neat cement. Fly ash is suggested to adopt in the extended mixing processes of cement systems."

However, host plants that survive in drought frequently lose yield. The potential of Funneliformis mosseae (F), Claroideoglomus etunicatum (C), and Acaulospora fovaeta (A) was assessed to evaluate in indica rice cv. Leum Pua during booting stage under 21-day water withholding. The effects of three inoculation types; (i) F, (ii) F + C (FC), and (iii) F + C + A (FCA), on physiological, biochemical, and yield traits were investigated. The three types showed an induced total chlorophyll content in the host as compared to uninoculated plants. Total soluble sugars and free proline were less regulated by FC and FCA inoculated plants than by F inoculated plants under water deficit conditions. However, the FC and FCA inoculations increased phosphorus content, particularly in the shoots of water-stressed plants. In the three inoculations, the FCA dramatically improved plant osmotic potential adaptability under water deficit stress. Furthermore, even when exposed to the water deficit condition, panicle weight, grain number, and grain maturity were maintained in FCA inoculated plants. According to the findings, the increased osmotic potential and phosphorus content of the FCA-inoculated rice plant provide a protection sign against drought stress and will benefit food security in the future."

The Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) was used to explore full-length 16S rDNA sequences of gut microbiota in animals once captured in their natural habitat and 1-year following translocation and housing in a hygienic environment at NPRCT-CU. Our findings show that the gut microbiota of macaques after 1 year of hygienic housing and programmed diets feeding was altered and reshaped. The prevalent gut bacteria such as Prevotella copri and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were enriched after translocation, causing the lower alpha diversity. The correlation analysis revealed that Prevotella copri, Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens, and Prevotella stercorea, showed a positive correlation with each other. Significantly enriched pathways in the macaques after translocation included biosynthesis of essential amino acids, fatty acids, polyamine and butanoate. The effects of microbiota change could help macaques to harvest the energy from programmed diets and adapt their gut metabolism. The novel probiotics and microbiota engineering approach could be further developed based on the current findings and should be helpful for captive animal health care management."

This study observed the effect of a two-generation exposure to an HFD on the peripheral taste system in offspring. Ten pregnant Wistar rats were assigned a standard diet (SD) (n = 5) or HFD (n = 5) from day 7 of pregnancy through the lactation. Thirty-six male and female 3-week-old offspring were measured for body weight and blood glucose level, and the circumvallate papillae were collected. The other twenty-four 3-week-old offspring were weaned on the same diet as their mothers and raised individually. The taste preference behaviors were studied using the two-bottle taste preference test and analyzed five basic tastes (sweet, bitter, umami, sour, and salty). The expressions of epithelial sodium channel alpha subunit (ENaCα) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) in the circumvallate papilla were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We found increased body weight and salty taste preference of offspring from the HFD group in both sexes. Correspondingly, the AT1 level of the taste bud cells significantly increased in 3-week-old female offspring from the HFD group. An increase in AT1 levels may be a risk factor for changes in salty taste preference."

The five predominant lichen-associated bacteria belonged to the phyla Proteobacteria (31.84%), Planctomycetota (17.08%), Actinobacteriota (15.37%), Verrucomicrobiota (12.17%), and Acidobacteriota (7.87%). The diversity analysis metric showed that Heterodermia contained the highest bacterial species richness. Within the lichens, Ramalina conduplicans and Cladonia rappii showed a distinct bacterial community from the other lichen species. The community of lichen-associated actinobacteria was investigated as a potential source of synthesized biologically active compounds. From the total Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found across the ten different lichen samples, 13.21% were identified as actinobacteria, including the rare actinobacterial genera that are not commonly found, such as Pseudonocardia, Kineosporia, Dactylosporangium, Amycolatopsis, Actinoplanes, and Streptosporangium. Evaluation of the pretreatment method (heat, air-drying, phenol, and flooding) and isolation media used for the culture-dependent actinobacterial isolation revealed that the different pretreatments combined with different isolation media were effective in obtaining several species of actinobacteria. However, metagenomics analyses revealed that there were still several strains, including rare actinobacterial species, that were not isolated. This research strongly suggests that lichens appear to be a promising source for obtaining actinobacteria."

This present study investigated the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PCV4 from high pig-density areas in Thailand during 2019–2020. From 734 samples, three samples (0.4%) from aborted fetuses and porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) cases were found positive for PCV4, two of the PCV4-positive samples were coinfected with both PCV2 and PRRSV, and the other PCV4-positive sample was found coinfected with PCV2. In situ hybridization (ISH) revealed the presence of PCV4 in the bronchial epithelial cells and in lymphocytes and histiocyte-like cells in the lymphoid follicles of the PRDC-affected pig. The complete Thai PCV4 genome had over 98% nucleotide identity with other PCV4 strains and was closely related to the Korean and Chinese PCV4b strains. Importantly, the amino acid residue at position 212 of the Cap gene is recommended for differentiating PCV4a (212L) from PCV4b (212M) based on currently available PCV4 genome sequences. These findings provide important clues for the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and genetic characteristics of PCV4 in Thailand."

Methods: JSE-HPS original version was translated to develop the draft Thai JSE-HPS version and was administered to 5 dental students for a pilot test. The final questionnaires (JSE-HPS) were completed by 439 dental students from five public universities and one private in Thailand in the 2021–2022 academic year. The internal consistency and reliability (test-retest) of the questionnaires were tested by using Cronbach’s alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Factor analysis was used to examine the underlying factors of the JSE-HPS (Thai language). Results: The JSE-HPS represented good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.83). Factor analysis revealed, “Compassionate Care”, “Perspective Taking” and “Ability to stand in Patients’ Shoes” as the first, second, and third factors, respectively. The mean empathy score of dental students was 114.30 (SD = 13.06) from the total score of 140. There were no significant differences in the empathy levels among genders, study programs, grades, universities, regions, types of universities, and years of study. Conclusion: The findings confirm the reliability and validity of the JSE-HPS (Thai version) to measure the empathy level among dental students. Integrating empathic elements into the dental curriculum will help student learning to be more effective and improve treatment outcomes."

Whole genome hybrid sequencing was applied to six mcr-positive E. coli (MCRPE) strains isolated from pigs, a farmworker and wastewater collected between 2017 and 2019. Among these, mcr-1.1 genes were identified on IncI2 plasmids from a pig and wastewater, and on IncX4 from the human isolate, whereas mcr-3 genes were found on plasmids IncFII and IncHI2 in two porcine strains. The MCRPE isolates exhibited genotypic and phenotypic multidrug resistance (MDR) traits as well as heavy metal and antiseptic resistance genes. The mcr-1.1-IncI2 and IncX4 plasmids carried only colistin resistance genes. Whereas, the mcr-3.5-IncHI2 plasmid presented MDR region, with several mobile genetic elements. Despite the MCRPE strains belonged to different E. coli lineages, mcr-carrying plasmids with high similarities were found in isolates from pigs and wastewater recovered in different years. This study highlighted that several factors, including the resistomic profile of the host bacteria, co-selection via adjunct antibiotic resistance genes, antiseptics, and/or disinfectants, and plasmid-host fitness adaptation may encourage the maintenance of plasmids carrying mcr genes in E. coli."
['Multidisciplinary'],"New insights into the neuroprotective and beta-secretase1 inhibitor profiles of tirandamycin B isolated from a newly found Streptomyces composti sp. nov.  2023, The Author(s).Tirandamycin (TAM B) is a tetramic acid antibiotic discovered to be active on a screen designed to find compounds with neuroprotective activity. The producing strain, SBST2-5T, is an actinobacterium that was isolated from wastewater treatment bio–sludge compost collected from Suphanburi province, Thailand. Taxonomic characterization based on a polyphasic approach indicates that strain SBST2-5T is a member of the genus Streptomyces and shows low average nucleotide identity (ANI) (81.7%), average amino-acid identity (AAI) (78.5%), and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) (25.9%) values to its closest relative, Streptomyces thermoviolaceus NBRC 13905T, values that are significantly below the suggested cut-off values for the species delineation, indicating that strain SBST2-5T could be considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces. The analysis of secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs) in its genome and chemical investigation led to the isolation of TAM B. Interestingly, TAM B at 20 µg/mL displayed a suppressive effect on beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) with 68.69 ± 8.84% inhibition. Molecular docking simulation reveals the interaction mechanism between TAM B and BACE1 that TAM B was buried in the pocket of BACE-1 by interacting with amino acids Thr231, Asp 228, Gln73, Lys 107 via hydrogen bond and Leu30, Tyr71, Phe108, Ile118 via hydrophobic interaction, indicating that TAM B represents a potential active BACE1 inhibitor. Moreover, TAM B can protect the neuron cells significantly (% neuron viability = 83.10 ± 9.83% and 112.72 ± 6.83%) from oxidative stress induced by serum deprivation and Aβ1–42 administration models at 1 ng/mL, respectively, without neurotoxicity on murine P19-derived neuron cells nor cytotoxicity against Vero cells. This study was reportedly the first study to show the neuroprotective and BACE1 inhibitory activities of TAM B."

Baicalein was previously reported as a potential anti-flaviviral candidate and halogenation of flavones and flavanones potentiated their antiviral efficacies. Here, we reported that a chemically modified 8-bromobaicalein effectively inhibited all dengue serotypes and Zika viruses at 0.66–0.88 micromolar in cell-based system. The compound bound to dengue serotype 2 conserved pocket and inhibited the dengue RdRp activity with 6.93 fold more than the original baicalein. Moreover, the compound was mildly toxic against infant and adult C57BL/6 mice despite administering continuously for 7 days. Therefore, the 8-bromobaicalein should be investigated further in pharmacokinetics and efficacy in an animal model."

By using the empirical data from different scientific disciplines and also the hypothetical data, this study shows that, the proposed model fits not only the data whose actual Lorenz plots have a typical convex segment but also the data whose actual Lorenz plots have both horizontal and convex segments practically well. It also perfectly fits the data whose observation is larger in size while the rest of observations are smaller and equal in size as characterized by two positive-slope linear segments. In addition, the proposed model has a closed-form expression for the Gini index, making it computationally convenient to calculate. Considering that the Lorenz curve and the Gini index are widely used in various disciplines of sciences, the proposed model and the closed-form expression for the Gini index could be used as alternative tools to analyze size distributions of non-negative quantities and examine their inequalities or unevennesses."

To evaluate that possible transmission, sixty, 4-week-old pigs were procured from an ASF free herd free. Upon arrival, pigs were randomly divided into two sets. Set 1 served as seeder pigs, and were randomly allocated to 4 groups. The other pigs were divided into 8 groups, and served as sentinels. Seeder pigs were oronasally challenged with ASFV at high (108 copy numbers/mL), moderate (106 copy numbers/mL) or low (101 copy numbers/mL) challenge titer, except a subgroup that remained unchallenged (negative control). At 7 days post challenge (peak viremia), all four seeder groups were intradermally and intramuscularly (IM) injected with a vaccine adjuvant (Diluvac Forte, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands) using a needle-free device (IDAL 3G, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands) and conventional needles, respectively. The same needle or needle-free device was then used to inject the same volume of adjuvant into set 2 (n = 48) pigs. All pigs were observed for clinical disease daily and assayed for the presence of ASFV DNA by quantitative PCR. All seeder groups developed viremia (except the control pigs). ASFV viremia was detected in all sentinel groups injected via the intramuscular route. Transmission rate from the IM route via conventional needles was positively correlated with virus titer in blood circulation of seeders. Sentinels intramuscularly exposed to needles from high titer challenged seeders displayed more severe and acute clinical disease compared to that of exposed to low titer challenged seeders. No viremia nor clinical signs were observed in the sentinel groups injected via the intradermal route. This study confirmed the hematogenous transmission of ASFV between pigs through needle-sharing."

We aim to generate a potential mechanism of NB-UVB through comparing the transcriptomic profile before and after NB-UVB treatment between the peripheral edge of lesional skin (PE skin) and the center of lesional skin (CE skin) on the basis of molecular mechanisms of these two areas display different downstream functions. More than one-fourth of the NB-UVB-altered genes were found to be plaque-specific. Some of them were psoriasis signature genes that were downregulated by NB-UVB in, both, PE and CE skin (core alteration), such as IL36G, DEFB4A/B, S100A15, KRT16, and KRT6A. After NB-UVB treatment, the activity score of upstream cytokines, such as interferons, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and IL-22 in pathogenesis decreased. In addition, NB-UVB could restore normal keratinization by upregulating LORICRIN and KRT2, particularly in the CE skin. Finally, we illustrated that NB-UVB is capable of suppressing molecules from the initiation to maintenance phase of plaque formation, thereby normalizing psoriatic plaques. This finding supports the usefulness of NB-UVB treatment in clinical practice and may help in the development of new treatment approaches in which NB-UVB treatment is included for patients with psoriasis or other inflammatory skin diseases."

It does not specifically address suicide ideation but, nonetheless, is sometimes used as an indicator of suicidality. The 9-item version of the EPDS (EPDS-9), which omits item 10, is sometimes used in research due to concern about positive endorsements of item 10 and necessary follow-up. We assessed the equivalence of total score correlations and screening accuracy to detect major depression using the EPDS-9 versus full EPDS among pregnant and postpartum women. We searched Medline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from database inception to October 3, 2018 for studies that administered the EPDS and conducted diagnostic classification for major depression based on a validated semi-structured or fully structured interview among women aged 18 or older during pregnancy or within 12 months of giving birth. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis. We calculated Pearson correlations with 95% prediction interval (PI) between EPDS-9 and full EPDS total scores using a random effects model. Bivariate random-effects models were fitted to assess screening accuracy. Equivalence tests were done by comparing the confidence intervals (CIs) around the pooled sensitivity and specificity differences to the equivalence margin of δ = 0.05. Individual participant data were obtained from 41 eligible studies (10,906 participants, 1407 major depression cases). The correlation between EPDS-9 and full EPDS scores was 0.998 (95% PI 0.991, 0.999). For sensitivity, the EPDS-9 and full EPDS were equivalent for cut-offs 7–12 (difference range − 0.02, 0.01) and the equivalence was indeterminate for cut-offs 13–15 (all differences − 0.04). For specificity, the EPDS-9 and full EPDS were equivalent for all cut-offs (difference range 0.00, 0.01). The EPDS-9 performs similarly to the full EPDS and can be used when there are concerns about the implications of administering EPDS item 10. Trial registration: The original IPDMA was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42015024785)."

Naturally acquired anti-PfGARP antibodies could confer protection against high parasitemia and severe symptoms. While whole genome sequencing analysis has suggested high conservation in this locus, little is known about repeat polymorphism in this vaccine candidate antigen. Direct sequencing was performed from the PCR-amplified complete PfGARP gene of 80 clinical isolates from four malaria endemic provinces in Thailand and an isolate from a Guinean patient. Publicly available complete coding sequences of this locus were included for comparative analysis. Six complex repeat (RI-RVI) and two homopolymeric glutamic acid repeat (E1 and E2) domains were identified in PfGARP. The erythrocyte band 3-binding ligand in domain RIV and the epitope for mAB7899 antibody eliciting in vitro parasite killing property were perfectly conserved across isolates. Repeat lengths in domains RIII and E1-RVI-E2 seemed to be correlated with parasite density of the patients. Sequence variation in PfGARP exhibited genetic differentiation across most endemic areas of Thailand. Phylogenetic tree inferred from this locus has shown that most Thai isolates formed closely related lineages, suggesting local expansion/contractions of repeat-encoding regions. Positive selection was observed in non-repeat region preceding domain RII which corresponded to a helper T cell epitope predicted to be recognized by a common HLA class II among Thai population. Predicted linear B cell epitopes were identified in both repeat and non-repeat domains. Besides length variation in some repeat domains, sequence conservation in non-repeat regions and almost all predicted immunogenic epitopes have suggested that PfGARP-derived vaccine may largely elicit strain-transcending immunity."

Acute cerebellar syndrome may occur, which can be explained by the extremely high accumulation of the drug in the cerebellum. However, presentation mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome similar to our case has never been reported. Case presentation: Here, we describe a 68-year-old Thai male presenting with advanced-stage cecal adenocarcinoma, as well as symptoms and signs indicative of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. He received two doses of intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg 6 hours before his symptoms occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed signal hyperintensity within the bilateral white matter. Further evaluation showed that his thiamine level was extremely low. Thus, he was diagnosed with fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The concomitant fluorouracil-induced thiamine deficiency eventually leads to rapid depletion of thiamine and was considered a risk factor for fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy. Conclusion: Fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy is believed to be caused by insult causing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown, but our finding suggests that thiamine deficiency plays a crucial role in fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy. Diagnosis is usually delayed due to a lack of clinical suspicion and results in significant morbidity requiring unnecessary investigations."
['Multidisciplinary'],"The lack of keratinized mucosa as a risk factor for peri-implantitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis  2023, The Author(s).This study aimed to investigate the effect of the lack of keratinized mucosa on the risk of peri-implantitis, while also accounting for possible confounding factors. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus, including human studies that assessed the presence and width of keratinized mucosa in relation to the occurrence of peri-implantitis. Twenty-two articles were included, and 16 cross-sectional studies we meta-analyzed. The prevalence of peri-implantitis was 6.68–62.3% on patient-level and 4.5–58.1% on implant-level. The overall analysis indicated that the lack of keratinized mucosa was associated with a higher prevalence of peri-implantitis (OR = 2.78, 95% CI 2.07–3.74, p < 0.00001). Similar results were shown when subgroup analyses were performed, including studies with a similar case definition of peri-implantitis (Marginal Bone Loss, MBL ≥ 2 mm) (OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.41–2.73, p < 0.0001), fixed prostheses only (OR = 2.82, 95% CI 1.85–4.28, p < 0.00001), patients under regular implant maintenance (OR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.41–3.08, p = 0.0002), and studies adjusting for other variables (OR = 3.68, 95% CI 2.32–5.82, p = 0.007). Thus, the lack of keratinized mucosa is a risk factor that increases the prevalence of peri-implantitis and should be accounted for when placing dental implants."
['Multidisciplinary'],"In vitro and in silico studies of 7′′,8′′-buddlenol D anti-inflammatory lignans from Carallia brachiata as p38 MAP kinase inhibitors  2023, The Author(s).Excessive macrophage activation induces the release of high levels of inflammatory mediators which not only amplify chronic inflammation and degenerative diseases but also exacerbate fever and retard wound healing. To identify anti-inflammatory molecules, we examined Carallia brachiata—a medicinal terrestrial plant from Rhizophoraceae. Furofuran lignans [(−)-(7′′R,8′′S)-buddlenol D (1) and (−)-(7′′S,8′′S)-buddlenol D (2)] isolated from the stem and bark inhibited nitric oxide (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 9.25 ± 2.69 and 8.43 ± 1.20 micromolar for 1 and 2, respectively) and prostaglandin E2 (IC50: 6.15 ± 0.39 and 5.70 ± 0.97 micromolar for 1 and 2, respectively) productions in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells. From western blotting, 1 and 2 suppressed LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner (0.3–30 micromolar). Moreover, analysis of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway showed decreased p38 phosphorylation levels in 1- and 2-treated cells, while phosphorylated ERK1/2 and JNK levels were unaffected. This discovery agreed with in silico studies which suggested 1 and 2 bound to the ATP-binding site in p38-alpha MAPK based on predicted binding affinity and intermolecular interaction docking. In summary, 7′′,8′′-buddlenol D epimers demonstrated anti-inflammatory activities via p38 MAPK inhibition and may be used as viable anti-inflammatory therapies."
['Multidisciplinary'],"An innovative wireless electrochemical card sensor for field-deployable diagnostics of Hepatitis B surface antigen  2023, The Author(s).A wireless-based detection utilizing an innovative electrochemical card (eCard) sensor controlled by a smartphone was developed for targeting Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). A simple label-free electrochemical platform allows a convenient operation for point-of-care diagnosis. A disposable screen-printed carbon electrode was modified straightforwardly layer-by-layer with chitosan followed by glutaraldehyde, allowing a simple but effective, reproducible, and stable method for covalently immobilizing antibodies. The modification and immobilization processes were verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The smartphone-based eCard sensor was used to quantify HBsAg by measuring the change in current response of the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- redox couple before and after the presence of HBsAg. Under the optimal conditions, the linear calibration curve for HBsAg was found to be 10–100,000 IU/mL with a detection limit of 9.55 IU/mL. The HBsAg eCard sensor was successfully applied to detect 500 chronic HBV-infected serum samples with satisfactory results, demonstrating the excellent applicability of this system. The sensitivity and specificity of this sensing platform were found to be 97.75% and 93%, respectively. As illustrated, the proposed eCard immunosensor offered a rapid, sensitive, selective, and easy-to-use platform for healthcare providers to rapidly determine the infection status of HBV patients."

This study aimed to describe the drug-related problems (DRPs) and the pharmaceutical care of home-isolating COVID-19 patients in Thailand. Methods: Our cross-sectional study was undertaken from July 1 to September 30, 2021, at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand. Patients who were ≥ 18 years old, were diagnosed with mild COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and were able to isolate at home while receiving an antiviral agent and standard symptomatic treatment were enrolled. Infectious disease pharmacists provided a telepharmacy service on days 1 and 3 after the COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: A total of 197 patients met the study criteria. Their median age was 45 years, and their most common underlying disease was hypertension (44.29%). All patients exhibited excellent anti-COVID-19 drug adherence. We identified 125 DRPs, including adverse reactions (68%), and the unnecessary use of products (62.40%). Moreover, 91 patients (46.19%) reported the use of supplements or herbs, with vitamin C being the main supplement (37.36%). Pharmacists provided 36 recommendations and received 33 questions from COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that telepharmacy is an essential service for detecting and preventing DRPs in home-isolating COVID-19 patients."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Nine patients with KCNQ2-related neonatal seizures and functional studies of two missense variants  2023, The Author(s).Mutations in KCNQ2 encoding for voltage-gated K channel subunits underlying the neuronal M-current have been associated with infantile-onset epileptic disorders. The clinical spectrum ranges from self-limited neonatal seizures to epileptic encephalopathy and delayed development. Mutations in KCNQ2 could be either gain- or loss-of-function which require different therapeutic approaches. To better understand genotype–phenotype correlation, more reports of patients and their mutations with elucidated molecular mechanism are needed. We studied 104 patients with infantile-onset pharmacoresistant epilepsy who underwent exome or genome sequencing. Nine patients with neonatal-onset seizures from unrelated families were found to harbor pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the KCNQ2 gene. The p.(N258K) was recently reported, and p. (G279D) has never been previously reported. Functional effect of p.(N258K) and p.(G279D) has never been previously studied. The cellular localization study demonstrated that the surface membrane expression of Kv7.2 carrying either variant was decreased. Whole-cell patch-clamp analyses revealed that both variants significantly impaired Kv7.2 M-current amplitude and density, conductance depolarizing shift in voltage dependence of activation, membrane resistance, and membrane time constant (Tau), indicating a loss-of-function in both the homotetrameric and heterotetrameric with Kv7.3 channels. In addition, both variants exerted dominant-negative effects in heterotetrameric with Kv7.3 channels. This study expands the mutational spectrum of KCNQ2- related epilepsy and their functional consequences provide insights into their pathomechanism."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Implementation of helicase-dependent amplification with SYBR Green I for prompt naked-eye detection of bacterial contaminants in platelet products  2023, The Author(s).Platelet transfusions may lead to more significant risks of infection and septic transfusion reactions that can be fatal to the recipient. Platelet products should be screened to limit or detect bacterial contamination before application to patients to minimise any adverse reactions. This study aimed to develop a helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) technique targeting a universal highly conserved bacterial gene, 16S rRNA, in combination with naked-eye detection using SYBR Green I (HDA/SYBR Green I) to detect bacterial contamination in platelet products. Thirty positive samples were obtained from spiked platelet products by five transfusion-relevant bacterial strains and were screened for bacterial contamination by HDA/SYBR Green I. HDA/SYBR Green I showed an enhanced yield of bacterial contaminant detection when performed with medium to late shelf life, Day 2 of storage or later platelet products (98.67% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to the BACT/ALERT culture system). The limit of detection of HDA/SYBR Green I was 1 ng, and there was no cross-reaction with other organisms that could likely contaminate platelet products. The developed HDA/SYBR Green I assay is rapid and simplistic and only requires an easy-to-find heat box, available in general blood bank laboratories, for the amplification step. This technique is suitable for further development as an alternative method to detect bacterial contamination in platelet products in the near future."

Materials and methods: Osteosarcoma cells (HOS, MG-63) and primary human mandibular osteoblasts (HmOBs) were co-cultured with HA-NPs-APTES conjugated with miRNA-302a-3p. Resazurin reduction assay was performed to evaluate HA-NPs-APTES biocompatibility. Intracellular uptake was demonstrated by confocal fluorescent and scanning electron microscopy. The miRNA-302a-3p and its mRNA targets expression levels including COUP-TFII and other osteogenic genes were assessed by qPCR on day1 or day5 post-delivery. Calcium deposition induced by the osteogenic gene upregulation was shown by alizarin red staining on day7 and 14 post-delivery. Results: Proliferation of HOS cells treated with HA-NPs-APTES was similar to that of untreated cells. HA-NPs-APTES was visualized in cell cytoplasm within 24 hours. MiRNA-302a-3p level was upregulated in HOS, MG-63 and HmOBs as compared to untreated cells. As a result, COUP-TFII mRNA expression was reduced, followed by an increase of RUNX2 and other osteogenic genes mRNA expression. Calcium deposition induced by HA-NPs-APTES-miR-302a-3p in HmOBs was significantly higher than in untreated cells. Conclusion: HA-NPs-APTES may support the delivery of miRNA-302a-3p into bone cells, as assessed by osteogenic gene expression and differentiation improvement once this combination is used on osteoblast cultures."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Cold atmospheric microwave plasma (CAMP) stimulates dermal papilla cell proliferation by inducing β-catenin signaling  2023, The Author(s).Hair loss or alopecia is an unpleasant symptom that exacerbates an individual's self-esteem and requires appropriate treatment. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a central pathway that promotes dermal papilla induction and keratinocyte proliferation during hair follicle renewal. GSK-3β inactivated by its upstream Akt and ubiquitin-specific protease 47 (USP47) has been shown to inhibit β-catenin degradation. The cold atmospheric microwave plasma (CAMP) is microwave energy enriched with mixtures of radicals. CAMP has been reported to have antibacterial and antifungal activities with wound healing activity against skin infection; however, the effect of CAMP on hair loss treatment has not been reported. We aimed to investigate the effect of CAMP on promoting hair renewal in vitro and to elucidate the molecular mechanism, targeting β-catenin signaling and YAP/TAZ, the co-activators in the Hippo pathway, in human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs). We also evaluated plasma effects on the interaction between hDPCs and HaCaT keratinocytes. The hDPCs were treated with plasma-activating media (PAM) or gas-activating media (GAM). The biological outcomes were determined by MTT assay, qRT-PCR, western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. We found that β-catenin signaling and YAP/TAZ were significantly increased in PAM-treated hDPCs. PAM treatment also induced β-catenin translocation and inhibited β-catenin ubiquitination by activating Akt/GSK-3β signaling and upregulating USP47 expression. In addition, hDPCs were more aggregated with keratinocytes in PAM-treated cells compared with control. HaCaT cells cultured in a conditioned medium derived from PAM-treated hDPCs exhibited an enhancing effect on activating YAP/TAZ and β-catenin signaling. These findings suggested that CAMP may be a new therapeutic alternative for alopecic treatment."
"['Gender Studies', 'Endocrinology']","Investigation of autism-related transcription factors underlying sex differences in the effects of bisphenol A on transcriptome profiles and synaptogenesis in the offspring hippocampus  2023, The Author(s).Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) has been linked to susceptibility to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our recent studies have shown that prenatal BPA exposure disrupted ASD-related gene expression in the hippocampus, neurological functions, and behaviors associated with ASD in a sex-specific pattern. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of BPA are still unclear. Methods: Transcriptome data mining and molecular docking analyses were performed to identify ASD-related transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes underlying the sex-specific effects of prenatal BPA exposure. Gene ontology analysis was conducted to predict biological functions associated with these genes. The expression levels of ASD-related TFs and targets in the hippocampus of rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA were measured using qRT-PCR analysis. The role of the androgen receptor (AR) in BPA-mediated regulation of ASD candidate genes was investigated using a human neuronal cell line stably transfected with AR-expression or control plasmid. Synaptogenesis, which is a function associated with genes transcriptionally regulated by ASD-related TFs, was assessed using primary hippocampal neurons isolated from male and female rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA. Results: We found that there was a sex difference in ASD-related TFs underlying the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the transcriptome profiles of the offspring hippocampus. In addition to the known BPA targets AR and ESR1, BPA could directly interact with novel targets (i.e., KDM5B, SMAD4, and TCF7L2). The targets of these TFs were also associated with ASD. Prenatal BPA exposure disrupted the expression of ASD-related TFs and targets in the offspring hippocampus in a sex-dependent manner. Moreover, AR was involved in the BPA-mediated dysregulation of AUTS2, KMT2C, and SMARCC2. Prenatal BPA exposure altered synaptogenesis by increasing synaptic protein levels in males but not in females, but the number of excitatory synapses was increased in female primary neurons only. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AR and other ASD-related TFs are involved in sex differences in the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on transcriptome profiles and synaptogenesis in the offspring hippocampus. These TFs may play an essential role in an increased ASD susceptibility associated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals, particularly BPA, and the male bias of ASD."
['Complementary and Alternative Medicine'],"Efficacy and safety of topical 0.1% cannabidiol for managing recurrent aphthous ulcers: a randomized controlled trial  2023, The Author(s).Background: Although topical steroids constitute the first-line therapy for recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAUs), their long-term use often leads to candidiasis. Although cannabidiol (CBD) can be an alternative for pharmacologically managing RAUs due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory in vivo effects, there is a lack of clinical and safety trials concerning its use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of topical 0.1% CBD for managing RAU. Methods: A CBD patch test was performed on 100 healthy subjects. CBD was applied on the normal oral mucosa of 50 healthy subjects 3 times/day for 7 days. Oral examination, vital signs, and blood tests were performed pre- and post-CBD use. Another 69 RAU subjects randomly received one of three topical interventions: 0.1% CBD, 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide (TA), or placebo. These were applied on the ulcers 3 times/day for 7 days. The ulcer and erythematous size were measured on day 0, 2, 5, and 7. Pain ratings were recorded daily. The subjects rated their satisfaction with the intervention and completed a quality-of-life questionnaire (OHIP-14). Results: None of the subjects exhibited allergic reactions or side effects. Their vital signs and blood parameters were stable before and after the 7-day CBD intervention. CBD and TA significantly reduced ulcer size more than placebo at all time points. The erythematous size reduction was higher in the CBD intervention than the placebo on day 2, while TA reduced the erythematous size at all time points. The pain score in the CBD group was lower compared with placebo on day 5, whereas TA reduced pain more than placebo on day 4, 5, and 7. The subjects receiving CBD reported higher satisfaction than placebo. However, the OHIP-14 scores were comparable among the interventions. Conclusions: Topical 0.1% CBD reduced ulcer size and accelerated ulcer healing without side effects. CBD exerted anti-inflammatory effects in the early stage and an analgesic effect in the late RAU stage. Thus, topical 0.1% CBD might be more appropriate for RAU patients who decline to take topical steroids, except for cases where CBD is contraindicated.

The HAp scaffolds were fabricated from the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) bones and fully characterized. The HAp scaffolds were coated with 12 formulations of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or poly (lactic acid) (PLA), blended with vancomycin. The vancomycin release, surface morphology, antibacterial properties, and the cytocompatibility of the scaffolds were conducted. The HAp powder contains elements identical to those found in human bones. This HAp powder is suitable as a starting material to build scaffolds. After the scaffold fabrication, The ratio of HAp to β-TCP changed, and the phase transformation of β-TCP to α-TCP was observed. All antibiotic-coated/ antibiotic-loaded HAp scaffolds can release vancomycin into the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. PLGA-coated scaffolds obtained faster drug release profiles than PLA-coated scaffolds. The low polymer concentration in the coating solutions (20%w/v) gave a faster drug release profile than the high polymer concentration (40%w/v). All groups showed a trace of surface erosion after being submerged in PBS for 14 days. Most of the extracts can inhibit Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The extracts not only caused no cytotoxicity to Saos-2 bone cells but also can increase cell growth. This study demonstrates that it is possible to use these antibiotic-coated/ antibiotic-loaded scaffolds in the clinic as an antibiotic bead replacement."

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among all 658 dental undergraduates in Mahidol University, Thailand. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire, including the following information: (1) “Background and Demographics”: household income, hometown, residence during study and source(s) of any financial aid received; (2) “Living Expenses”: Living costs including food, transportation, rent, utility bills, and recreational expenses; (3) ”Education related expenses”: Including textbooks, stationeries, uniforms, and student activities fees. A cost-median was used as a baseline representation for the actual cost of each item. The mean differences of all expenses between groups before estimation was assessed by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. The statistically significant differences were identified at p < 0.001. Results: The estimated adjusted cost of becoming a dentist in Thailand is THB1,265,027 (36,143.63 USD) for students living at home and THB1,823,027 (52,086.49 USD) for those renting accommodation. Students who rented accommodation incurred significantly higher yearly living expenses than those who were living at home. (p < 0.001). The majority of participants (78.4%) were in households having a middle-to-high socioeconomic status. Ninety-five percentages of the participants’ received 100% financial support from their families with no additional source of income, which reflects no real diversity in the socioeconomic background of Dental Degree students.

In addition, an alcohol-acidolysis of PLA by multifunctional 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (DMPA) produces lactate oligomers with hydroxyl and carboxylic acid terminals. In this work, a process for sizing down commercial PLA resin to optimum medium-sized lactate oligomers is developed at a lower cost than a bottom-up synthesis from its monomer. The microwave-assisted reaction is conveniently conducted at 220–240 °C and pressure lower than 100 psi. The PLA resin was completely converted via alcohol-acidolysis reaction, with a product purification yield as high as 93%. The resulting products are characterized by FTIR, 2D-NMR, 1H-NMR, GPC, DSC, and XRD spectroscopy. The effects of PLA: DMPA feed ratios and the incorporation of 1,4-butanediol (BDO) on the structures, properties, and particle formability of the alcohol-acidolyzed products are examined. The products from a ratio of 12:1, which possessed optimum size and structures, are used to synthesize PLA-based polyurethane (PUD) by reacting with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI). The resulting PUD is employed in encapsulating lavender essential oil (LO). Without using any surfactant, stable LO-loaded nanoparticles are prepared due to the copolymer’s self-stabilizability from its carboxylate groups. The effect of the polymer: LO feed ratio (1.25–3.75: 1) on the physicochemical properties of the resulting nanoparticles, e.g., colloidal stability (zeta potential > -60 mV), hydrodynamic size (300–500 nm), encapsulation efficiency (80–88%), and in vitro release, are investigated. The LO-loaded nanoparticles show non-toxicity to fibroblast cells, with an IC50 value higher than 2000 µg/mL. The products from this process have high potential as drug encapsulation templates in biomedical applications."

However, there remains little consensus in the literature regarding its efficacy in children and adolescents with special educational needs (SEN). This study aimed to examine HIIT as a means of improving key health and fitness parameters in children and adolescents with SEN. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on eight databases (MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library). Studies were eligible if they 1) included an HIIT protocol, 2) examined parameters related to both physical and mental aspects of health and fitness, and 3) examined children and adolescents with SEN aged 5–17 years. Results: Of the 1727 studies yielded by the database search, 13 (453 participants) were included and reviewed. We found that HIIT generally improved body composition, physical fitness, and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers across a spectrum of SEN (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, developmental coordination disorder, and mental illness). Improvements in mental health and cognitive performance following HIIT have also been observed. Conclusion: This review provides up-to-date evidence for HIIT as a viable exercise strategy for children and adolescents with SEN. Further research investigating the benefits of HIIT in a wider range of SEN populations is warranted.

"['Orthopedics and Sports Medicine', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","Effects of Platelet-Rich Plasma in Tear Size Reduction in Partial-Thickness Tear of the Supraspinatus Tendon Compared to Corticosteroids Injection  2023, The Author(s).Objectives: Corticosteroid (CS) injection is commonly used in partial-thickness rotator cuff tears to decrease pain. However, this could result in unwanted side effects, such as tendon rupture. Alternatively, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection is frequently used to treat tendinopathies because it enhances healing. This study aimed to compare the differences in tear size and functional scores between intralesional PRP and subacromial CS injections. Methods: Patients with symptomatic partial-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon who underwent conservative treatment for ≥ 3 months were enrolled. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis. Fourteen and 15 patients were randomized to receive intralesional PRP and subacromial CS injections, respectively. Tears were measured in the coronal and sagittal planes. The patients underwent another MRI 6 months after the injection. Tear size was compared between the two MRI results. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder score (ASES) and Constant–Murley score (CMS) were also obtained. Results: The baseline data were similar between the groups. In the coronal plane, PRP and CS showed tear size reductions of 3.39 mm (P = 0.003) and 1.10 mm (P = 0.18), respectively. In the sagittal plane, PRP and CS showed tear size reductions of 2.97 mm (P = 0.001) and 0.76 mm (P = 0.29), respectively. Functional scores improved 6 months after injection in both groups, but PRP showed better functional scores than CS (P = 0.002 for ASES, P = 0.02 for CS). Conclusion: Intralesional PRP injection can reduce the tear size in partial-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon. Subacromial steroid injection did not significantly affect the tear size. While CS improved functional scores compared with baseline, PRP resulted in better improvement 6 months post-injection. Trial registration Thai Clinical Trials Registry, TCTR20210428004.

Categorical Boosting Machine Regressor (CatBoost) performed the best on the equilibrium temperature prediction using 10 relevant attributes on the unseen data set with R2 of 0.973, RMSE of 1.375, and MAPE of 0.269 %. Feature selection suggested that only 7 necessary attributes are adequate to make a model, which is comparable to the full model. The model was then explained via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analyses. Cyclic molecules without hydrogen bond donors, with low polarity, at a mole fraction in the range of 0.02 – 0.07 were suggested to be effective formers that can shift the equilibrium temperature to higher levels."

A nucleotide matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI-TOF MS)-based assay was developed (called point mutation array, PMA) to identify four major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron (namely PMA-ABDO) and differentiate Omicron subvariant (namely PMA-Omicron). PMA-ABDO and PMA-Omicron consist of 24 and 28 mutation sites of the spike gene. Both PMA panels specifically identified VOCs with as low as 10 viral copies/µl. The panel has shown a 100% concordant with the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) results testing on 256 clinical specimens with real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values less than 26. It showed a higher sensitivity over NGS; 25/28 samples were positive by PMA but not NGS in the clinical samples with PCR Ct higher than 26. Due to the mass of nucleotide used to differentiate between wild-type and mutation strains, the co-infection or recombination of multiple variants can be determined by the PMA method. This method is flexible in adding a new primer set to identify a new emerging mutation site among the current circulating VOCs and the turnaround time is less than 8 h. However, the spike gene sequencing or NGS retains the advantage of detecting newly emerged variants."

A total number of 63 colostrum, transient and mature milk were collected from primiparous and multiparous Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred sows. Macrochemical, fatty acid and non-volatile polar metabolite compositions of samples were analyzed using infrared spectrometry, gas chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated significant impacts of lactation stage and parity number on colostrum and milk compositions. Chemometric analysis revealed significant influences of sow parity on the distinction in fatty acid profiles of mature milk while the distinction in non-volatile polar metabolite profiles was more evident in colostrum. Alterations in the concentration of linoleic (C18:2n6), lignoceric (C24:0), behenic (C22:0), caprylic (C8:0) and myristoleic (C14:1) acid together with those of creatine, creatinine phosphate, glutamate and glycolate were statistically suggested to be mainly affected by sow parity number. Variations in the concentration of these compounds reflected the physiological function of sow mammary gland influenced. This information could be applied for feed and feeding strategies in lactating sows and improving lactating performances."

The effective control strategy requires convenient approach for detecting and differentiating MS strains and reliable drug susceptible evidence for deciding on reasonable antimicrobial usage. This study aimed to characterize the partial vlhA gene of nine Thai MS isolates circulated in chickens in 2020, to verify the PCR-RFLP assay for strain differentiation, and to determine the eight antimicrobial susceptibility profiles using microbroth dilution method. Based on sequence analysis of the partial vlhA gene, Thai MS isolates in 2020 were classified as types E and L with 19 and 35 amino acid lengths, respectively. The developed PCR-RFLP assay could detect and differentiate vaccine and Thai field strains. Most Thai MS isolates in this study were susceptible to tylosin, tylvalosin, tiamulin, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, tilmicosin, and lincomycin-spectinomycin at MIC50 values of 0.0391, 0.0098, 0.0781, 0.1563, 0.1563, 0.625 and 0.625 μg/mL, respectively; and resistance to enrofloxacin at MIC50 value of 10 μg/mL. In conclusion, this study revealed diagnostic assays for differentiating MS strains and the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Thai MS, which are necessary to design suitable MS control procedures for poultry flocks."

['Multidisciplinary'],"Detection of Babesia bovis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with improved thermostability, sensitivity and alternative visualization methods  2023, The Author(s).Bovine babesiosis is one of the most economically important tick-borne diseases in tropical and subtropical countries. A conventional microscopic diagnosis is typically used because it is inexpensive and expeditious. However, it is highly dependent on well-trained microscopists and tends to be incapable of detecting subpatent and chronic infections. Here, we developed a novel nucleic acid-based amplification method using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in conjunction with a colori-fluorometric dual indicator for the rapid and accurate detection of Babesia bovis based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We aimed to improve the thermostability, sensitivity, specificity, and alternative visualization of LAMP-based methods. We assessed its diagnostic performance compared to two conventional PCR agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-AGE) methods. The thermostability of LAMP reaction mixtures and DNA templates in variable conditions was also assessed. In addition, we evaluated alternative visualization methods using different light sources including neon, LED, and UV lights. We found that the LAMP-neon was ten times more sensitive than the PCR-AGE, while the LAMP-LED and LAMP-UV were 1,000 times more sensitive. The current LAMP method showed no cross-amplification with uninfected cattle DNA or other common blood parasites in cattle, including Babesia bigemina, Theileria orientalis, Anaplasma marginale, and Trypanosoma evansi. In addition, the developed LAMP method has good thermostability and the potential for on-site utility as B. bovis DNA could still be detected up to 72 h after initial preparation. Our findings suggested that the developed LAMP method provides an alternative approach for B. bovis detection with sensitivity higher than PCR-AGE diagnostics, high specificity, and the flexibility to use neon, LED, and UV light sources for positive signal observations."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Toxic Ag+ detection based on Au@Ag core shell nanostructure formation using Tannic acid assisted synthesis of Pullulan stabilized gold nanoparticles  2023, The Author(s).Herein, a sensitive colorimetric detection strategy is proposed for Ag+ detection based on the use of environmentally friendly synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), at room temperature, using (tannic acid, TA), as the reductant and pullulan (PUL) as stabilizing agent. The colloidal solution (TA/PUL-AuNPs), at the optimal synthesis conditions, showed maximum absorbance at 529 nm with a berry red color. TEM and FESEM validated that the particles are spherical and monodispersed, while other characterization results elucidated the role of pullulan in the nano-synthesis. Ag+ addition to the probe (TA/PUL-AuNPs), pH 11, resulted in naked-eye color changes, owing to Au@Ag core shell nanostructure formation. Further, the added Ag+ is reduced to AgNPs, on the surface of the TA/PUL-AuNPs probe. A hypsochromic shift in the absorption maximum, from 529 to 409 nm was observed, while (AAg+-Abl)@409 nm exhibited linearity with Ag+ concentrations, from 0.100 to 150 µM. The estimated limit of detection was 30.8 nM, which is far lower than the acceptable limit of 0.930 µM from the regulatory agency. The TA/PUL-AuNPs probe was further tested for Ag+ detection in lake water samples, and it displayed satisfactory detection performances for real sample applications."
['Multidisciplinary'],"BORC complex specific components and Kinesin-1 mediate autophagy evasion by the autophagy-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strain  2023, The Author(s).Autophagy induction by starvation has been shown to enhance lysosomal delivery to mycobacterial phagosomes, resulting in the restriction of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv. In contrast to H37Rv, our previous study showed that strains belonging to the notorious M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype could evade autophagic elimination. Our recent RNA-Seq analysis also discovered that the autophagy-resistant M. tuberculosis Beijing strain (BJN) evaded autophagic control by upregulating the expression of Kxd1, a BORC complex component, and Plekhm2, both of which function in lysosome positioning towards the cell periphery in host macrophages, thereby suppressing enhanced lysosomal delivery to its phagosome and sparing the BJN from elimination as a result. In this work, we further characterised the other specific components of the BORC complex, BORC5-8, and Kinesin proteins in autophagy resistance by the BJN. Depletion of BORCS5-8 and Kinesin-1, but not Kinesin-3, reverted autophagy avoidance by the BJN, resulting in increased lysosomal delivery to the BJN phagosomes. In addition, the augmented lysosome relocation towards the perinuclear region could now be observed in the BJN-infected host cells depleted in BORCS5-8 and Kinesin-1 expressions. Taken together, the data uncovered new roles for BORCS5-8 and Kinesin-1 in autophagy evasion by the BJN."
"['Reproductive Medicine', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology']","Does socioeconomic factors and healthcare coverage affect postpartum sterilization uptake in an urban, tertiary hospital?  2023, The Author(s).Background: Postpartum sterilization in Thailand has relatively few barriers compared to other countries. The procedure is covered by some healthcare plans, and paid out-of-pocket for others. We aim to determine if healthcare coverage and other socioeconomic factors affect the rate of postpartum sterilization in an urban, tertiary hospital. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a retrospective cohort of 4482 postpartum women who delivered at our hospital. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine if sterilization reimbursement affects immediate postpartum sterilization rate. Results: Overall immediate postpartum sterilization rate was 17.8%. Route of delivery and parity were similar in those who were reimbursed and those who were not. Women aged over 25 were more likely to have a healthcare plan that does not cover postpartum sterilization. Women whose healthcare plan reimbursed the procedure trended towards postpartum sterilization when compared to women who were not (aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86–1.28, p-value = 0.632). Women who delivered via cesarean section were more likely to undergo sterilization at the time of delivery (aOR = 5.87; 95% CI 4.77–7.24, p-value = < 0.001). Women aged 40–44 years were 2.70 times as likely to choose sterilization than those aged 20–24 years (aOR = 2.70; 95% CI 1.61–4.53, p-value < 0.001). Conclusions: Healthcare coverage of the procedure was not associated with increased postpartum sterilization in our setting."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Identifying molecular targets of Aspiletrein-derived steroidal saponins in lung cancer using network pharmacology and molecular docking-based assessments  2023, The Author(s).Lung cancer is one of the leading cancers and causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Due to its high prevalence and mortality rate, its clinical management remains a significant challenge. Previously, the in vitro anticancer activity of Aspiletrein A, a steroid and a saponin from Aspidistra letreae, against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells was reported. However, the anticancer molecular mechanism of other Aspiletreins from A. letreae remains unknown. Using in silico network pharmacology approaches, the targets of Aspiletreins were predicted using the Swiss Target Prediction database. In addition, key mediators in NSCLC were obtained from the Genetic databases. The compound-target interacting networks were constructed using the STRING database and Cytoscape, uncovering potential targets, including STAT3, VEGFA, HSP90AA1, FGF2, and IL2. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis demonstrated that several pathways were highly relevant to cancer pathogenesis. Additionally, molecular docking and molecular dynamic analyses revealed the interaction between key identified targets and Aspiletreins, including hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interaction. This study provides potential targets of Aspiletreins in NSCLC, and its approach of integrating network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and molecular docking is a powerful tool for investigating the mechanism of new drug targets on a specific disease."

An accurate diagnosis is challenging due to their complex clinical presentations and genetic heterogeneity. This study aimed to determine the utilisation of exome sequencing (ES) for Thai paediatric patients with muscular disorders. Of 176 paediatric patients suspected of genetic/inherited myopathies, 133 patients received a molecular diagnosis after performing conventional investigations, single gene testing, and gene panels. The remaining 43 patients from 42 families could be classified into three groups: Group 1, MLPA-negative Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with 9 patients (9/43; 21%), Group 2, other muscular dystrophies (MD) with 18 patients (18/43; 42%) and Group 3, congenital myopathies (CM) with 16 patients (16/43; 37%). All underwent exome sequencing which could identify pathogenic variants in 8/9 (89%), 14/18 (78%), and 8/16 (50%), for each Group, respectively. Overall, the diagnostic yield of ES was 70% (30/43) and 36 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 14 genes were identified. 18 variants have never been previously reported. Molecular diagnoses provided by ES changed management in 22/30 (73%) of the patients. Our study demonstrates the clinical utility and implications of ES in inherited myopathies."

We aimed to estimate the treatment effect and find the best gait rehabilitation to regain velocity, distance, and Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI) among incomplete spinal cord injury patients. Method: PubMed and Scopus databases were searched from inception to October 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in comparison with any of the following: conventional physical therapy, treadmill, functional electrical stimulation and robotic-assisted gait training, and reported at least one outcome. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and extracted the data. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects or fixed-effect model according to the heterogeneity. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was indirectly compared with all interventions and reported as pooled unstandardized mean difference (USMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated to identify the best intervention. Results: We included 17 RCTs (709 participants) with the mean age of 43.9 years. Acute-phase robotic-assisted gait training significantly improved the velocity (USMD 0.1 m/s, 95% CI 0.05, 0.14), distance (USMD 64.75 m, 95% CI 27.24, 102.27), and WISCI (USMD 3.28, 95% CI 0.12, 6.45) compared to conventional physical therapy. In NMA, functional electrical stimulation had the highest probability of being the best intervention for velocity (66.6%, SUCRA 82.1) and distance (39.7%, SUCRA 67.4), followed by treadmill, functional electrical stimulation plus treadmill, robotic-assisted gait training, and conventional physical therapy, respectively. Conclusion: Functional electrical stimulation seems to be the best treatment to improve walking velocity and distance for incomplete spinal cord injury patients. However, a large-scale RCT is required to study the adverse events of these interventions. Trial registration: PROSPERO number CRD42019145797."

Tooth agenesis (TA) is one of the most common developmental anomalies in humans, and its prevalence and patterns are different across ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the phenotypes and sex-associated patterns of nonsyndromic tooth agenesis (TA) in Thai dental patients. Methods: One thousand ninety panoramic radiographs were examined. One hundred and one subjects (37 males, 64 females, 15–20 years-old) with nonsyndromic TA were evaluated. Differences in TA prevalence between groups were analyzed using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. Results: The TA prevalence, excluding third molars, was 9.3% and more frequently found in the mandible compared with the maxilla. The maxilla demonstrated a higher prevalence of first premolar agenesis than the mandible (P = 0.012), while the mandible had a higher prevalence of second premolar agenesis than the maxilla (P = 0.031). There were significantly more males missing one tooth than females, however, there were more females missing two or more teeth than males (P = 0.042). A missing maxillary left lateral incisor was significantly more frequent in males (P = 0.019), while a missing mandibular right lateral incisor was more frequent in females (P = 0.025). In females, the pattern of two mandibular lateral incisors agenesis was the most common and significantly present in females more than males (P = 0.015). In contrast, the pattern of one mandibular left lateral incisor agenesis was only observed in males and significantly found in males more than females (P = 0.047). Conclusions: We demonstrate sex-associated differences in nonsyndromic tooth agenesis. The prevalence of single tooth agenesis was higher in males, while that of two or more teeth agenesis was higher in females. We found different patterns of lateral incisor agenesis between males and females."

Better chewing ability is associated with healthy aging. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the relationship between social backgrounds, dental service utilization, oral status and chewing difficulty, there is no study in Thailand using national oral health data to identify the variables involved with chewing difficulty among Thai older adults. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association between oral status, and chewing difficulty, adjusting for social backgrounds, and dental service utilization among Thai older adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the eighth Thai National Oral Health Survey (TNOHS). A stratified multi-stage method was used for sample selection. The eighth TNOHS was conducted from June–August 2017. Data were collected using interviews and clinical oral examinations by trained interviewers and trained dentists, respectively. The bivariate analysis, chi-square test was used to explore the associations between social backgrounds, dental service utilization, oral status, and chewing difficulty. Dependent variables with p-values of < 0.2 for their association with independent variables in the bivariate analysis were entered into the multiple logistic regression models. Results: This study found that older adults with at least 27 teeth (p < 0.05), or at least eight occlusal pairs (p < 0.05) or income exceeding 15,000 baht per month (p < 0.05) were more likely to have less chewing difficulty (p < 0.001), while the elderly who utilized dental services in the past 12 months were associated with more chewing difficulty than those who did not utilize dental services in the past 12 months (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We suggest that policymakers increase the number of preventive plans and set a goal for more than 20 remaining natural teeth and four posterior occlusal pairs in young and working aged people, especially in the low income group."

Although multidisciplinary adverse drug reaction (ADR) services to verify and de-label drug allergic histories have been operated in particular hospitals in Thailand, their performances have not been reported. This research aimed to examine the effectiveness of verification of drug allergic history and de-labeling (VD) services of the physician-led multidisciplinary ADR clinic. Methods: This research was a retrospective descriptive study. Medical charts of patients with at least one drug allergic history who received VD services at the multidisciplinary clinic between January 2017 to December 2018, were reviewed. Data on the history of drug allergy, VD services, and results were analyzed and presented using descriptive statistics. Results: Seventy patients’ charts were reviewed, and 171 unconfirmed drug allergic histories were identified. 79.53% of the reported reactions involved skin and soft tissues. The most found adverse skin reactions were maculopapular rash, pruritic and erythematous rash, and angioedema. The remaining 20.47% were systemic reactions which included drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), anaphylaxis, and nausea/vomiting was the most prevalent. Antituberculosis, beta-lactam antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most reported suspected drugs. Drug allergic history reviewing by physicians or pharmacists could confirm and de-label for 3 and 20 reactions, respectively. Seven and one reactions were confirmed by enzyme‐linked immunospot assay and patch test, respectively. The provocation tests with the suspected or alternative drug were conducted in 64 reactions. Twelve reactions were confirmed, and 45 reactions were de-labeled. Totally, 65/171 (38.01%) allergic histories were successfully de-labeled, 23/171 (13.45%) were confirmed, and 83/171 (48.53%) were inconclusive. Conclusions: More than half of drug allergic histories were successfully confirmed or de-labeled by the multidisciplinary ADR team. The collaborative activities of various healthcare professionals, consisting of physicians, nurse, and pharmacists as presented in the study were effective in VD services and should be implemented in other healthcare settings."

In the formulation, the couple stress and surface elasticity theories are adopted to simulate the microstructured bulk layer and the surface material, respectively. A general solution of an elastic field within the bulk layer is obtained first by Hankel transform method and subsequently used together with the surface equations and boundary conditions to form a set of conditions essential for determining all unknown constants. After being fully tested with available benchmark solutions, results are used to study the role of surface and couple stresses on the load transferring mechanism to the substrate and its size-dependent characteristic for a wide range of external length scales relative to the internal length scales."

Pre and pro-biotics could enhance the shrimp immune system by increasing the phenoloxidase (PO), prophenoloxidase (ProPO), and superoxide dismutase activities. During viral infection, the host immune system alteration could influence the gut microbiome composition and probably lead to other pathogenic infections. Since the JAK/STAT pathway is involved in white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection, we investigated the intestine immune genes of STAT-silenced shrimp. During WSSV infection, expression levels of PmVago1, PmDoral, and PmSpätzle in PmSTAT-silenced shrimp were higher than normal. In addition, the transcription levels of antimicrobial peptides, including crustinPm1, crustinPm7, and PmPEN3, were higher in WSSV-challenged PmSTAT-silenced shrimp than the WSSV-infected normal shrimp. Meanwhile, PmSTAT silencing suppressed PmProPO1, PmProPO2, and PmPPAE1 expressions during WSSV infection. The microbiota from four shrimp tested groups (control group, WSSV-infected, PmSTAT-silenced, and PmSTAT-silenced infected by WSSV) was significantly different, with decreasing richness and diversity due to WSSV infection. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes was reduced in WSSV-challenged shrimp. However, at the species level, P. damselae, a pathogen to human and marine animals, significantly increased in WSSV-challenged shrimp. In constrast, Shewanella algae, a shrimp probiotic, was decreased in WSSV groups. In addition, the microbiota structure between control and PmSTAT-silenced shrimp was significantly different, suggesting the importance of STAT to maintain the homeostasis interaction with the microbiota."

Here we described the clinical and genetic characteristics of biopsy-proven FSGS patients in Thailand. Patients with FSGS pathology, without secondary causes, were included in our study. Clinical laboratory and pathological data were collected. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was subsequently performed. 53 unrelated FSGS patients were recruited. 35 patients were adults (66.0%), and 51 patients were sporadic cases (96.2%). Clinical diagnosis before kidney biopsy was steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) in 58.5%, and proteinuric chronic kidney disease in 32.1%. Using WES, disease-associated pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants could be identified in six patients including the two familial cases, making the P/LP detection rate of 11.3% (6/53). Of these six patients, two patients harbored novel variants with one in the COL4A4 gene and one in the MAFB gene. Four other patients carried previously reported variants in the CLCN5, LMX1B, and COL4A4 genes. Four of these patients (4/6) received immunosuppressive medications as a treatment for primary FSGS before genetic diagnosis. All four did not respond to the medications, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing to avoid unnecessary treatment. Notably, the mutation detection rates in adult and pediatric patients were almost identical, at 11.4% and 11.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the overall P/LP variant detection rate by WES in biopsy-proven FSGS patients was 11.3%. The most identified variants were in COL4A4. In addition, three novel variants associated with FSGS were detected."

HPV has over 150 types, yet certain 14–20 high-risk and 13–14 low-risk types are common, and, thus, most conventional HPV nucleic acid assays, for examples, Cobas 4800 HPV test (Roche Diagnostics, New Jersey, USA) and REBA HPV-ID (Molecules and Diagnostics, Wonju, Republic of Korea) were developed to cover these types. We thereby utilized bioinformatics combined with recent isothermal amplification technique at 35–42 °C to firstly describe multiplex recombinase polymerase amplification assay that is specific to these common 20 high-risk and 14 low-risk types, and also L1 and E6/E7 genes that target different stages of cervical cancer development. Multiplex primer concentrations and reaction incubation conditions were optimized to allow simultaneous two gene detections at limit of detection of 1000 copies (equivalent to 2.01 fg) for L1 and 100 copies (0.0125 fg) for E6/E7, respectively. The assay was validated against urogenital and other pathogens, normal flora, and human control. In 130 real clinical sample tests, the assay demonstrated 100% specificity, 78% diagnostic accuracy, and 75% sensitivity compared with REBA HPV-ID test, and is much more rapid (15–40 min), less expensive (~ 3–4 USD/reaction) and does not require instrumentation (35–42 °C reaction condition so hand holding or tropical temperature is possible). Hence, the developed novel assay provides alternative screening tool for potential local screening. Furthermore, as this assay uses safe chemical reagents, it is safe for users."

The understanding of potential molecular targets is necessary for clinical implications in precision diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a major deacetylase enzyme, is a promising target for cancer therapy; however, the molecular mechanism regulating cancer pathogenesis is largely unknown. Methods: The clinical relevance of HDAC6 expression levels and their correlation with the overall survival rate were analyzed based on the TCGA and GEO databases. HDAC6 expression in clinical samples obtained from lung cancer tissues and patient-derived primary lung cancer cells was evaluated using qRT–PCR and Western blot analysis. The potential regulatory mechanism of HDAC6 was identified by proteomic analysis and validated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, microtubule sedimentation, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays using a specific inhibitor of HDAC6, trichostatin A (TSA) and RNA interference to HDAC6 (siHDAC6). Lung cancer cell growth was assessed by an in vitro 2-dimensional (2D) cell proliferation assay and 3D tumor spheroid formation using patient-derived lung cancer cells. Results: HDAC6 was upregulated in lung cancer specimens and significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Inhibition of HDAC6 by TSA and siHDAC6 caused downregulation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), which was dependent on the tubulin acetylation status. Tubulin acetylation induced by TSA and siHDAC6 mediated the dissociation of p-ERK on microtubules, causing p-ERK destabilization. The proteomic analysis demonstrated that the molecular chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was an important scaffolder required for p-ERK localization on microtubules, and this phenomenon was significantly inhibited by either TSA, siHDAC6, or siGRP78. In addition, suppression of HDAC6 strongly attenuated an in vitro 2D lung cancer cell growth and an in vitro 3D patient derived-lung cancer spheroid growth. Conclusions: HDAC6 inhibition led to upregulate tubulin acetylation, causing GRP78-p-ERK dissociation from microtubules. As a result, p-ERK levels were decreased, and lung cancer cell growth was subsequently suppressed. This study reveals the intriguing role and molecular mechanism of HDAC6 as a tumor promoter, and its inhibition represents a promising approach for anticancer therapy."

The current study compared the procedural success and complication rates between used and not used IVUS catheter in the patients who were met (C +) and were not met (C−) the AUC for IVUS-guided PCI. From June 2018 through June 2019, a total of 21,066 patients were included in the Thai PCI registry. Among the study population, 15,966 patients (75.8%) have met the IVUS-AUC. The IVUS-guided PCI rates were 14.5% and 11.3% in the C + and C − groups, respectively. After adjusting for covariables by propensity model, IVUS-guided PCI was identified as an independent predictor of the procedural success rate regardless of whether the AUC were met with the relative risk [RR (95% confidence interval (CI)] of 1.033(1.026–1.040) and 1.012(1.002–1.021) in C + and C− groups, respectively. IVUS-guided PCI increased the procedural complication risks in both groups but were not significant with corresponding RRs of 1.171(0.915–1.426) and 1.693(0.959–2.426). Procedural success was achieved with IVUS-guided PCI regardless of whether the AUC were met. IVUS-guided PCI did not lead to an increase in procedural complications."

PI-RVF was defined as (1) the need for mechanical circulatory support post-transplant, or (2) evidence of RVF post-transplant as measured by right atrial pressure (RAP) > 15 mmHg, cardiac index of < 2.0 L/min/m2 or inotrope support for < 72 h, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 18 mmHg, and transpulmonary gradient < 15 mmHg with pulmonary systolic pressure < 50 mmHg. PI-RVF can be diagnosed from the first 24–72 h after completion of heart transplantation. A total of 122 consecutive patients who underwent HTX were reviewed. Of these, 11 were excluded because of secondary causes of graft dysfunction (GD). PI-RVF was present in 65 of 111 patients (59%) and 31 (48%) met the criteria for PGD-RV. Severity of patients with PI-RVF included 41(37%) mild, 14 (13%) moderate, and 10 (9%) severe. The median onset of PI-RVF was 14 (0–49) h and RV recovery occurred 5 (3–14) days after HTX. Severe RV failure was a predictor of 30-day mortality (HR 13.2, 95% CI 1.6–124.5%, p < 0.001) and post-transplant dialysis (HR 6.9, 95% CI 2.0–257.4%, p = 0.001). Patients with moderate PI-RVF had a higher rate of 30-day mortality (14% vs. 0%, p = 0.014) and post-operative dialysis (21% vs. 2%, p = 0.016) than those with mild PI-RVF. Among patients with mild and moderate PI-RVF, patients who did not meet the criteria of PGD-RV had worsening BUN/creatinine than those who met the PGD-RV criteria (p < 0.05 for all). PI-RVF was common and can occur after 24 h post-HTX. The median RV recovery time was 5 (2–14) days after HTX. Severe PI-RVF was associated with increased rates of 30-day mortality and post-operative dialysis. Moderate PI-RVF was also associated with post-operative dialysis. A revised definition of PGD-RV may be needed since patients who had adverse outcomes did not meet the criteria of PGD-RV."
['Multidisciplinary'],"3D reconstruction of proximal femoral fracture from biplanar radiographs with fractural representative learning  2023, The Author(s).A femoral fracture is a severe injury occurring in traumatic and pathologic causes. Diagnosis and Preoperative planning are indispensable procedures relying on preoperative radiographs such as X-ray and CT images. Nevertheless, CT imaging has a higher cost, radiation dose, and longer acquisition time than X-ray imaging. Thus, the fracture 3D reconstruction from X-ray images had been needed and remains a challenging problem, as well as a lack of dataset. This paper proposes a 3D proximal femoral fracture reconstruction from biplanar radiographs to improve the 3D visualization of bone fragments during preoperative planning. A novel Fracture Reconstruction Network (FracReconNet) is proposed to retrieve the femoral bone shape with fracture details, including the 3D Reconstruction Network (3DReconNet), novel Auxiliary class (AC), and Fractural augmentation (FA). The 3D reconstruction network applies a deep learning-based, fully Convolutional Network with Feature Pyramid Network architecture. Specifically, the auxiliary class is proposed, which refers to fracture representation. It encourages network learning to reconstruct the fracture. Since the samples are scarce to acquire, the fractural augmentation is invented to enlarge the fracture training samples and improve reconstruction accuracy. The evaluation of FracReconNet achieved a mIoU of 0.851 and mASSD of 0.906 mm. The proposed FracReconNet’s results show fracture detail similar to the real fracture, while the 3DReconNet cannot offer."

Water hyacinth is a naturally occurring weed that can grow aggressively, causing eutrophication and leading to many severe environmental impacts. Here, through the pyrolysis process, we convert water hyacinth to biochar and use it for acid soil amendment. We found the ratio between biochar, soil, and sand suitable for the cultivation of water convolvulus to be 50 g of biochar, 400 g of soil, and 100 g of sand (1:8:2). This soil mixture improved the pH of the soil from 4.73 to 7.57. The plant height of the water convolvulus grown in the soil mixture was the greatest at 20.45 cm and the plant weight with and without roots was greatest at 2.23 g and 2.52 g, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated the dominance and high abundance of Bacillus among the community in soil with biochar amendment. Here we provide the first assessment of the appropriate amount of water hyacinth-derived biochar for mitigation of soil acidity and promotion of optimal water convolvulus growth. Moreover, biochar can optimally modify soil bacterial communities that benefit plant development."
"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","“Assessing exposure of printing factory workers in thailand to selected heavy metals using urine and hair as non-invasive matrices”  2023, The Author(s).Background: There are few thorough studies on the extent and inter-element relationships of heavy metal contamination in printing factory workers, especially in developing countries. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of eight heavy metals, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and manganese (Mn), in urine and scalp hair of printing industry workers, and assess inter-element correlations. Methods: We examined a total of 85 urine samples and 85 scalp hair samples (3 cm hair segments taken from near the scalp) in 85 printing workers from a printing house in Bangkok, Thailand. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire about participants’ printing techniques, work characteristics, and work environment. Urine and scalp hair samples were analyzed for levels of each element using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) technique. Results: As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb were detected in urine with the geometric mean concentration range of 0.0028–0.0209 mg/L, and Hg, Pb, Ni, Cd, Co, Mn, Cr were detected in hair samples (0.4453–7.165 mg/kg dry weight) of printing workers. The geometric mean Ni level was significantly higher in the urine of production line workers than back-office personnel (0.0218 mg/L vs. 0.0132 mg/L; p = 0.0124). The other elements did not differ significantly between production line and back-office workers in either urine or hair. There was also a strong, statistically significant positive correlation between Ni and Co levels in hair samples of workers (r = 0.944, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Average concentrations of most of the metals in urine and hair of printing workers were found to be above the upper reference values. The significantly higher concentrations of Ni in production line workers might be due to more exposure to printed materials. A strong inter-element correlation between Ni and Co in hair samples can increase stronger health effects and should be further investigated. This study reveals possible dependencies and impact interactions of heavy metal exposure in printing factory workers."

Two cellulase enzymes: SIGMA-ALDRICH laboratory grade cellulase from Aspergillus niger and atres Zymix plus as a commercial cellulase enzyme were applied. It was found that the boiled hot water pre-treatment with the commercial cellulase gave the highest total monosaccharides yields. Glucose was the most significant part (78–86%) of the monosaccharides. For the pre-treatment with dilute acid, glucose was also the main component of monosaccharides; however, for the alkali pre-treatment, xylose was the main monosaccharide. It made up 48–85% of the total monosaccharide compared to glucose that made up 5–49% of total monosaccharide. Boiled rice straw with commercial cellulase enzyme provided the highest glucose yield compared to other experiments. Moreover, the obtained results from GC–MS/MS analysis show that up to 62 species of phenolic compound could be found in enzymatic hydrolysis of the rice straw waste. Aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon substances were also detected in the FEEM analysis. From the overall results, the integrated enzymatic hydrolysis with boil hot water pre-treatment was the most efficient method for monosaccharide production from the rice straw waste."

As a result, understanding of the hosts, vectors, and biology of ungulate malaria parasites has remained limited. In this study, we aimed to identify the vectors of the goat malaria parasite Plasmodium caprae. A total of 1019 anopheline and 133 non-anopheline mosquitoes were collected from goat farms in Thailand, where P. caprae-infected goats were discovered. Anopheline mosquitoes were identified using molecular biological methods that target the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (cox2) genes, and the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region. Pool and individual mosquitoes were tested for P. caprae using the head-thorax parts that contain the salivary glands, with primers targeting three genetic markers including cytochrome b, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, and 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA genes. Additionally, goat blood samples were collected concurrently with mosquito surveys and screened to determine the status of malaria infection. This study revealed nine mosquito species belonging to six groups on goat farms, including Hyrcanus, Barbirostris, Subpictus, Funestus, Tessellatus, and Annularis. The DNA of P. caprae was detected in Anopheles subpictus and Anopheles aconitus. This is the first time An. subpictus and An. aconitus have been implicated as probable vectors of P. caprae."

However few studies have measured the ability of individuals to “withstand setbacks, adapt positively, and bounce back from adversity” on a global scale. We aimed to examine the level of resilience, its determinants, and its association with maladaptive coping behaviours during the pandemic. Methods: The Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU) conducted a global survey involving 26 countries by online, self-administered questionnaire (October 2020-December 2021). It was piloted-tested and validated by an expert panel of epidemiologists and primary care professionals. We collected data on socio-demographics, socioeconomic status, clinical information, lifestyle habits, and resilience levels measured by the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) among adults aged ≥ 18 years. We examined factors associated with low resilience level, and evaluated whether low resilience was correlated with engagement of maladaptive coping behaviours. Results: From 1,762 surveys, the prevalence of low resilience level (BRS score 1.00–2.99) was 36.4% (America/Europe) and 24.1% (Asia Pacific). Young age (18–29 years; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.31–0.58 in older age groups), female gender (aOR = 1.72, 95% C.I. = 1.34–2.20), poorer financial situation in the past 6 months (aOR = 2.32, 95% C.I. = 1.62–3.34), the presence of one (aOR = 1.56, 95% C.I. = 1.19–2.04) and more than two (aOR = 2.32, 95% C.I. = 1.59–3.39) medical conditions were associated with low resilience level. Individuals with low resilience were significantly more likely to consume substantially more alcohol than usual (aOR = 3.84, 95% C.I. = 1.62–9.08), take considerably more drugs (aOR = 12.1, 95% C.I. = 2.72–54.3), buy supplements believed to be good for treating COVID-19 (aOR = 3.34, 95% C.I. = 1.56–7.16), exercise less than before the pandemic (aOR = 1.76, 95% C.I. = 1.09–2.85), consume more unhealthy food than before the pandemic (aOR = 2.84, 95% C.I. = 1.72–4.67), self-isolate to stay away from others to avoid infection (aOR = 1.83, 95% C.I. = 1.09–3.08), have an excessive urge to disinfect hands for avoidance of disease (aOR = 3.08, 95% C.I. = 1.90–4.99) and transmission (aOR = 2.54, 95% C.I. = 1.57–4.10). Conclusions: We found an association between low resilience and maladaptive coping behaviours in the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk factors identified for low resilience in this study were also conditions known to be related to globalization-related economic and social inequalities. Our findings could inform design of population-based, resilience-enhancing intervention programmes."

If the performance of the organization increases, then the organization may lead in the global perspective. There are various factors that could lead to the performance. Among those, the supply chain management practices (SCMP) play an important role to increase the performance. The SCMP factors may also enhance the competitive advantage of the organizations. Furthermore, the manager support may provide insight to manage the SCM activities which could aid enhance firm performance (FP). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the SCMP and FP with the moderating and mediating effect in the chemical industry of Thailand. The data was collected from the supply chain managers by using a simple random technique. The SEM direct effect shows that SCMA had a significant and positive connection with firm performance FP. In addition, SCMP does not seem to have any significant relationship with the competitive advantage. While competitive advantage has a positive and significant effect on FP. On the other hand, the indirect effect shows that SCMP and FP relationship were partially mediated from the competitive advantage. Moreover, the manager's support did not significantly moderate the SCMP and FP relationship. The current study added literature in the extant literature in the form of empirical findings which could help the researchers explore their studies in future. The study may also provide help to owners as well as to shareholders to know about the importance of the SCMP, competitive advantage and managers' support to increase their FP."

On pure SiO2, incorporating WOx improved tungsten dispersion and formation of active tetrahedral WOx species, compared to the impregnated ones. However, negative effect was found when tungsten was incorporated in the 1%Al-doped SiO2 as the catalysts contained more crystalline WOx, lower tetrahedral species, and lower Lewis acid sites, compared to the W-imp 1Al2O3/SiO2 prepared by impregnation. Incorporating both W and Al in the SiO2 by sol-gel method may lead to suppression of bridge hydroxyl Si(OH)Al group, as a consequence more crystalline WOx was formed. Nevertheless, the abundance of Bronsted and Lewis acid was found to play important role in the propene metathesis and the secondary metathesis of 1-butene reactions than surface silanol and the presence of tetrahedral tungsten oxide species on the 1%Al-doped SiO2 supported catalysts."

Methods: The IBA-CC01, Sun Nuclear EDGE and IBA-SFD detectors were employed to determine the uncorrected and the corrected field output factors for 6 MV photon beams. Measurements were performed at 100 cm source to axis distance, 10 cm depth in water, and the field sizes ranged from 1 × 1 to 10 × 10 cm2. The use of field output correction factors proposed by the TRS-483 was utilised to determine field output factors. The measured field output factors were compared to that calculated using the egs_chamber user code. Results: The decrease in the percentage standard deviation of the measured three detectors was observed after applying the field output correction factors. Measured field output factors using CC01 and EDGE detectors agreed with MC values within 3% for field sizes down to 1 × 1 cm2, except the SFD detector. Conclusions: The corrected field output factors agree with the calculation from MC, except the SFD detector. CC01 and EDGE are suitable for determining field output factors, while the SFD may need more implementation of the intermediate field method."

There is discussion around the optimal construction materials and designs for artificial reefs, the influences these have on biological communities, and the resulting ecological and social benefits. This discussion also includes the ecological value of repurposed marine infrastructure, such as decommissioned oil and gas platforms. Platforms often have an operational life spanning multiple decades, over which time they can develop extensive and unique community assemblages. The creation of artificial reefs by repurposing oil and gas platforms can have ecological, economic and sociological merit. However, with >12,000 platforms requiring decommissioning globally, there is the need for holistic assessment of biological communities associated with these platforms to inform the potential outcomes of different decommissioning options. We use environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) of water, bio-foul and sediment samples to census broad eukaryotic diversity at eight platforms in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT) and five nearby soft sediment habitat locations. We sampled three target depths at sites (shallow, mid, deep) and detected 430 taxa at platforms, with higher diversity in shallow (near-surface) samples (313 taxa), compared to mid (30 m collection depth; 261 taxa) and deep (50 m; 273 taxa). Three percent of taxa were shared among all depths at platforms with distinct assembles at each depth. Introduced species are an ongoing risk for platforms, however the eDNA detected no known introduced species. While the eDNA data provide broad taxon coverage and significant assemblage patterns, ongoing sampling innovation, assay design and local reference material still require development to obtain the maximum benefit of the technique. This study highlights the versatility and scalability of eDNA metabarcoding to holistically census marine infrastructure and inform the management and potential conservation of extant communities."

This study explores the novel idea of utilizing bhimal fiber, and the interaction of agro-industrial wastes, resulting in will improve the economy of the farmers and the state. The bio composites were created by incorporating different types of industrial-waste particulates, including CaCO3, Flyash, and TiO2, at varying weight percentages with 15% and 20% by weight of Bhimal fiber. NaOH-treated Bhimal fiber was cast-off for improving to surface structure of native cellulose and resulting in enhancement of the mechanical properties of the biocomposites. The study found that the incorporation of CaCO3/Flyash/TiO2 at 5, 10, and 15 Weight (wt.)% with 20 and 15 wt% of Bhimal-fiber enhanced the properties of developed biocomposites. Incorporation of TiO2 at 5 wt% leads to a significant improvement in tensile and compressive strength along with hardness, by 122.26%, 103.02%, and 73.54%, respectively. The flexural strength decreased with increasing percentages of CaCO3/TiO2 (from 5 to 15 wt%), while fly-ash incorporation at 5, 10, and 15 wt% led to an increase in flexural strength, with a maximum increase of 135.06% at 15 wt% fly-ash, and an increase in impact strength of 295.51% at 10 wt% of fly-ash. The incorporation of nano-TiO2 resulted in lowest porosity by 13.22% and higher thermal stability. The study concluded that Nano-TiO2 is the most effective filler for reinforcing the bio composite."

The fidelity of accurately computed IACs is essential for reliable three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics analyses of bubbly flows because the IACs directly affect the interfacial force and interfacial heat and mass transfer rates. This study targeted development of a simple and robust model for predicting the local IAC under steady-state bubbly flows with and without phase change. The dependent two-phase flow parameters of the IAC were derived by considering bubble coalescence and breakup rates. The IAC transport equation simplified under steady-state conditions was used for this purpose. A simplified turbulence model was introduced to formulate the energy dissipation rate per unit mass necessary for computing the bubble coalescence and breakup rates. The prediction accuracy of the local IAC model for bubbly flow conditions with area-average void fraction values less than 10 % was estimated to be 20 % based on 803 local data collected for adiabatic air–water bubbly flows in round tubes with diameters ranging from 9.0 to 200 mm. The model was also applied to predict the local IAC data of subcooled boiling flows in heated channels with hydraulic diameters ranging from 18.5 to 22.2 mm. The test conditions covered pressures from 0.1 to 1.46 MPa. The model prediction accuracy for bubbly flow conditions with area-average void fraction values less than 10 % was estimated to be 40 % based on 155 subcooled boiling flow data."

In this study, the removal of crude oil from seawater by immobilized bacterial consortium was performed and the enhancement of crude oil degradation efficiency by varying immobilization methods and inoculum volume ratio was examined. The nonpathogenic and heavy metal-tolerant bacterial consortium of Sphingobium naphthae MO2-4 and Priestia aryabhattai TL01-2 was immobilized by biofilm formation on aquaporousgels. The simultaneous immobilization of strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 showed better crude oil removal efficiency than independent immobilization, which indicated positive interactions among consortium members in the mixed-culture immobilized systems. Moreover, the immobilized consortium at a 2:1 (MO2-4:TL01-2) inoculum volume ratio showed the best crude oil removal capacity. The immobilized consortium removed 77% of 2000 mg L-1 crude oil in seawater over 7 days. The immobilized consortium maintained crude oil removal efficacy in semicontinuous experiments. In addition, the immobilized consortium was used to remediate seawater contaminated with 1000 mg L-1 crude oil in a 20 L wave tank. After 28 days, the crude oil degradation efficiency of immobilized consortium was approximately 70%, and crude oil degradation through natural attenuation was not observed. Moreover, the genomic features of strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 are reported. Genomic analyses of both strains confirmed the presence of many genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation, heavy metal resistance, biosurfactant synthesis, and biofilm formation, supporting the biodegradation results and characterizing strain properties. The results of this work introduce the potential benefit of simultaneous immobilization of bacterial consortia to improve efficiency of crude oil biodegradation and has motivated further investigations into large-scale remediation of crude oil-contaminated seawater."

However, for calcium aluminate cement (CAC) composites, the investigation of the GNP reinforcing effect is lacking. The synergistic effects of GNP and fly ash (FA) in CAC composites were evaluated in this study. The GNP was initially dispersed in mixing water using a dispersant combined with ultrasonication. The CAC composites with different GNP contents were prepared and their mechanical performance was investigated. In addition, partial replacement of CAC with FA was investigated for increasing sustainability and material cost of GNP-CAC composites. Their fresh properties, mechanical properties, and microstructural performance were analyzed using different techniques involving flowability, bulk density, volume of permeable void, water absorption, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, nitrogen adsorption, TGA, and SEM-EDS tests. Using FA and GNP in CAC composites offers a positive impact by significantly increasing their strengths. Optimized mix was achieved by replacing 20% of FA and adding 0.3% of GNP in CAC composites. Results revealed that the 20% FA replacement of cement with 0.3% GNP addition remarkably increased the compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths at 28 days by about 57.2%, 35.5%, and 21.7%, respectively. The results suggest that using FA and GNP contributes to synergistic effects to promote the formation of silica tetrahedron in calcium aluminate silicate hydrate (CASH) gel, to refine pore characteristics, and to reduce conversion effects of metastable phases of CAC such that it can ultimately produce a green rapid-set high-performance concrete system."

"['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","A novel traffic load balancing approach for scheduling of optical transparent antennas (OTAs) on mobile terminals  2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Optical transparent antennas (OTAs) are a relatively new technology that allows for high-speed wireless communication using a transparent antenna placed on the surface of a mobile device. However, scheduling OTA transmissions can be challenging due to several factors that must be considered. One critical consideration when developing a scheduling plan for OTAs is bandwidth. OTA-based mobile terminals require a significant amount of bandwidth to transmit and receive data, which means it's essential to ensure that enough bandwidth is available for OTA transmissions. This can be achieved by monitoring network traffic patterns and allocating sufficient bandwidth for OTA transmissions. Another important factor to consider is the signal strength of OTA transmissions. The strength of these signals can be affected by factors such as weather conditions, interference from other sources, and the location of the mobile terminal. Scheduling of OTAs can be planned successfully when the signal strength is optimal to ensure that transmissions can take place without any hurdles. Developing a scheduling plan for OTAs in mobile terminals is a complicated process, requiring consideration of several factors. These include ensuring sufficient bandwidth for OTA transmissions due to their high bandwidth requirements, signal strength should be optimal and OTA usage should be minimal when battery levels are low to conserve power. Additionally, network congestion and user preferences should also be considered when scheduling the OTAs. The smart scheduling mechanisms are required to handle the mobile applications while handling OTAs on mobile terminals. This study is proposing a modified traffic load clustering (MTLC) scheduling mechanism for scheduling OTAs on mobile terminals.

The characterization results reveal that the face-centered cubic crystalline (fcc)-structured NiPd bimetallic alloy nanoparticles are encased by thin carbon nanotubes. The bimetallic synergism of NiPd nanoparticles actuates the outer CNT layers and accelerates the electrical conductivity, stimulating the electrochemical activity toward an effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By virtue of the collective individualities of highly conductive aligned carbon walls and bimetallic active sites, the NiPd@CNT-equipped HER delivers a minimum overpotential of 87 mV and a Tafel slope value of 95 mV dec−1. The existing intact contact between NiPd and CNT facilitates continuous electron and ion transportation and firm stability toward long-term hydrogen production in HER. Notably, the NiPd@CNT reported here produces excellent electrochemical activity with minimal charge transference resistance, substantiating the efficacy of NiPd@CNT for futuristic green hydrogen production."

The CAR cryogels were prepared by freeze-drying method based on the effects of CAR types which were different sulfate ester group content in the structure, K-CAR concentrations, and blending K and I-CAR. According to the results, the increasing K-CAR concentrations affected to reduce the swelling behavior and pore size of cryogels. However, the swelling behavior was increased and pore size was decreased with blending K/I-CAR. The release mechanism of DCNa and Theo was a non-fickian and fickian diffusion depending on drug types, cryogels composition, and applied electric potentials. The amount of drug release was decreased with increasing K-CAR concentrations and decreased with a blending K/I-CAR. However, the amount of drug release was increased with increasing electric potential, especially an anionic drug. The amount of DCNa was higher than that of Theo with and without applied electric potential. The maximum amount of drug release was 78.06 and 58.78% for DCNa and Theo, respectively. Thus, the CAR cryogel is suitable for controlled release of ionic and non-ionic drug with and without applied electric field."

However, the problem of fast deactivation makes the utilization of the γ-Al2O3 challenging. This work elucidates the mechanism of coke formation consisting of coke deposition and evolution on γ-Al2O3(110) surfaces in differential conditions, including; clean and hydroxylation γ-Al2O3(110) in terms of partial and fully hydroxylation of OH/γ-Al2O3(110) and AlOOH(010), respectively. We demonstrated that the γ-Al2O3(110) surface is proper for atomic coke deposition and dimerization in the initial state, where the presence of OH species promotes the coke evolution to higher coke, Cn (where n ≥ 3). Also, the higher coke formation thermodynamically preferred the cyclic form to the aliphatic one. The electron transfer from substrates to adsorbed coke illustrates the role of the electron donor of catalyst surfaces corresponding to the electron acceptor of adsorbed cokes."
"['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","Chaotic heterogeneous comprehensive learning PSO method for size and shape optimization of structures  2023 Elsevier LtdThis paper proposes a novel chaotic heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) method for the simultaneous size and shape design of structures. The heterogeneous CLPSO divides the particles into two explorative and exploitative subpopulations. The exploration performs the global searches for the set of best particles experienced solely within its own subpopulation, whilst the exploitation refines the deep searches learnt from the global best particle over an entire population. In essence, the proposed method maintains a good balance between the global explorative and local exploitative optimization schemes. The global searches within the explorative subpopulation are independent to the exploitative simulations even if the latter scheme prematurely converges to the local swarm position. For both subpopulations, the comprehensive learning approach constructs the particles through a cross-positioning process on the individual variable space and avoids the local optimal pitfall. Moreover, the chaotic logistic map within the exploitative optimization tests the global best particle through the set of diversely generated samples and hence enhances the local search ability. Various enriching techniques, including automatic adaptive (inertial weight and acceleration) parameters with dynamic space reduction, are incorporated to improve the likelihood of finding the optimal solution of practical-scale problems at modest computing efforts. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are illustrated through a number of planar and spatial truss design benchmarks subjected to the challenging nonconvex and/or nonsmooth programs."
"['Environmental Engineering', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Waste Management and Disposal', 'Pollution']","A novel approach for the prediction and analysis of daily concentrations of particulate matter using machine learning  2023Traditional air quality analysis and prediction methods depend on the statistical and numerical analyses of historical air quality data with more information related to a specific region; therefore, the results are unsatisfactory. In particular, fine particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) in the atmosphere is a major concern for human health. The modelling (analysis and prediction) of particulate matter concentrations remains unsatisfactory owing to the rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization. In the present study, we reconstructed a prediction model for both PM2.5 and PM10 with varying meteorological conditions (windspeed, temperature, precipitation, specific humidity, and air pressure) in a specific region. In this study, a prediction model was developed for the two observation stations in the study region. The analysis of particulate matter shows that seasonal variation is a primary factor that highly influences air pollutant concentrations in urban regions. Based on historical data, the maximum number of days (92 days in 2019) during the winter season exceeded the maximum permissible level of particulate matter (PM2.5 = 15 μg/m3) concentration in air. The prediction results showed better performance of the Gaussian process regression model, with comparatively larger R2 values and smaller errors than the other models. Based on the analysis and prediction, these novel methods may enhance the accuracy of particulate matter prediction and influence policy- and decision-makers among pollution control authorities to protect air quality."

This study verifies the hypothesis that to achieve safe rice cultivation, magnet-assisted soil washing followed by soil amendment using zero-valent iron (ZVI) is required not only for rapid remediation of the existing Cd contamination but also for the prevention of Cd recontamination caused by contaminated run-off from an upgradient contaminated paddy. Accordingly, this study conducted a pilot-scale demonstration of the combined technique to restore a real Cd-contaminated paddy (41.02 ± 5.47 mg/kg−1) and compared it with remediation using only soil amendment with ZVI or only magnet-assisted soil washing. The Cd concentration in rice grains from the contaminated rice field without treatment was 0.86 ± 0.01 mg/kg−1, and thus higher than the acceptable level of 0.4 mg/kg−1. Even though the use of magnet-assisted soil washing without amendment initially removed all the bioavailable Cd from the soil, it failed to reduce Cd uptake by the rice plants. This failure was caused by heavy off-season rain, which flooded and re-contaminated the experimental fields with Cd-contaminated run-off from an upgradient contaminated field, leading to a Cd concentration in rice grains of 1.21 ± 0.01 mg/kg−1. Similarly, the use of ZVI as a soil amendment without magnet-assisted soil washing could not ensure safe rice cultivation during the off-season flood, as Cd concentration in the rice grains was still 0.60 mg/kg−1. However, magnet-assisted soil washing followed by soil amendment using ZVI successfully removed Cd from soil and sequestered Cd from Cd-contaminated run-off, resulting in protection against Cd re-contamination in soil and the reduction of Cd content in rice grains to 0.33 mg/kg−1, representing a 60% removal efficacy. Also, this combined technique remained positive for rice growth compared to non-treatment."
['Radiation'],"Electron beam irradiation for enhancing the properties of natural rubber latex  2023 Elsevier LtdRaw rubber must be vulcanized to produce a useful rubber product. Vulcanization is a chemical process that creates crosslinking points between rubber molecules, transforming it into a thermosetting material. This study aimed to prepare vulcanized natural rubber latex containing a sulfur curing package by irradiating it with electron beams at doses of 1–30 kGy. The crosslink density increased with increasing electron doses. Additionally, electron beam irradiation increased the entanglement of rubber molecules, resulting in superior mechanical properties such as modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break, and tear strength in the natural rubber latex. However, when high electron doses (>10 kGy) were applied, the crosslink density reduced owing to polymer degradation or chain scission, leading to inferior mechanical properties. To evaluate the potential of using irradiation as a replacement for conventional vulcanization processes, the properties of natural rubber latex containing a sulfur curing package vulcanized by electron beam irradiation were compared with those vulcanized by heat (conventional process). The mechanical properties of the natural rubber latex vulcanized by electron beam irradiation were superior to those of the rubber vulcanized by heat, with a 40% increase in modulus, 80% increase in tensile strength, 14% increase in elongation at break, and 36% increase in tear strength. According to these findings, electron beam irradiation, which offers high productivity and shorter processing time, is a suitable vulcanization process for natural rubber latex containing a sulfur curing package, with electron doses of 5 and 10 kGy providing superior overall balanced properties."

The interfacial area concentration is a critical parameter in determining the performance of the heat and mass transfer systems. The one-dimensional one-group interfacial area transport equation (IATE) was developed based on area-averaged bubbly flow data collected under uniform inlet flow boundary conditions. The applicability of the IATE to the flow systems with non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions was not comprehensively examined. This study investigated the effect of inlet liquid and gas velocity profiles on measured interfacial area concentration changes along the flow direction. The data used in this study were collected for vertical upward air-water two-phase flow in a rectangular channel with a gap length of 10 mm and width of 200 mm. The test conditions were the superficial gas velocity ranging from 0.0870 to 0.288 m/s and the superficial liquid velocity ranging from 0.515 to 2.53 m/s. The interfacial area concentrations with uniform and non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions measured in a large vertical rectangular channel were compared under the same area-averaged flow rate conditions. Then, the predictive capability of the IATE to the bubbly flow test data with uniform and non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions was assessed. Some non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions, including channel-center peaking of liquid flow (CPF), channel-center peaking of gas flow (CPG), single-side-wall peaking of liquid flow (SPF), and single-side-wall peaking of gas flow (SPG), significantly affected the interfacial area concentration changes along the axial location at relatively high superficial gas or liquid velocity conditions. The IATE's predictive capability deteriorated for several non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions, including double-side-wall peaking of gas flow (DPG) and single-side-wall peaking of liquid flow (SPF), specifically at relatively high superficial liquid velocity conditions. The maximum percentage error of the interfacial area concentration prediction by the IATE for these non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions reached 75%."

Thus, a facile synthesis of SiO2-carbon core–shell (SiO2@C) nanoparticles with tunable sizes and shapes for efficient controlled release was developed to prolong the antibacterial activity of thymol (T). The physicochemical properties, and surface bonding between thymol and the carbon shell were determined with XPS, NEXAFS, and DFT studies. An in vitro thymol release study was also applied, and the prolonged antibacterial performance was evaluated with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The optimal conditions for producing spherical SiO2@C core–shell nanostructures with a uniform size distribution included an ethanol-to-water ratio of 20:80 (E20W80). This produced a SiO2@C core–shell material with a high porous carbon content and a large pore volume. Moreover, SiO2@C-T exhibited the highest thymol release profile. DFT studies demonstrated that the thymol was physically adsorbed on the carbon surface. This adsorption mode was advantageous for prolonged release. Consequently, the bacteriostatic agent SiO2@C-T E20W80 showed sustained thymol release levels of up to 40% over 48 h.

Currently, cannabis extracts are used in medicine, but the amount of THC as a main psychoactive component is strictly regulated. Therefore, the ability to rapidly and accurately detect THC is important. Herein, we developed a sensitive electrochemical method combining a rapid lateral flow assay (LFA) to detect THC rapidly. An electrochemical LFA device was constructed by attaching a screen-printed electrode inside a lateral-flow device to exploit the remarkable binding of THC to the cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor in the test zone. The ferrocene carboxylic acid attached to the monoclonal THC antibody acts as an electroactive species when it binds to the THC in the sample before it flows continuously to the CB2 receptor region on the electrode. Under optimal conditions, the detection time is within 6 min and the devise shows excellent performance with a detection limit of 1.30 ng/mL. Additionally, the device could be applied to detect THC in hemp extract samples. The results obtained from this sensor are similar to the standard method (HPLC) for detecting THC. Therefore, this proposed device is useful as an alternative device for the on-site determination of THC because it is inexpensive, portable, and exhibits high sensitivity."

The purpose of this study is to address these challenges by creating 3D-printed flexible HPEs with varying porosity from polyacrylamide (PAM) using digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. The electrochemical properties of the 3D-printed HPEs were compared to conventional casted HPEs. The 3D printed HPEs exhibited improved electrochemical performance, especially in ionic conductivity (28.10 mS cm−1, equivalent to the current conventional HPEs). Higher porosity in the 3D printed HPEs enhanced electrolyte absorption and facilitated Zn2+ ions diffusion, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results. Furthermore, galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements demonstrated that the 3D-printed PAM hydrogel electrolyte with 40% porosity achieved a specific capacity of 161.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1.

However, achieving stable and uniform zinc electrodeposition, particularly at high current densities, remains a significant challenge. Herein, the mechanism of charging zinc-air flow batteries under high current density conditions is investigated in detail. Through a combination of experimental and computational methods, both the individual and combined effects of current density and electrolyte flow rate on zinc electrodeposition are studied. Critical aspects of zinc electrodeposition, including ion concentration gradients, overpotential, mass transfer impedance, and gas evolution are scrutinized. Findings demonstrate that flow velocity profoundly affects current density regulation and mass transfer, while bubble formation at high current densities has implications for induced overpotential and overall charging performance. The surface morphology of electrodeposited zinc, as well as the formation and motion of bubbles, are evaluated using both in-situ and ex-situ microscopic imaging techniques. Optimal uniformity of zinc deposition is achieved by combining a current density of 60 mA cm−2 with a flow rate of 0.021 m s−1. Applying these conditions to a zinc-air battery results in excellent durability, maintaining commendable performance throughout 78 h of charge/discharge cycling.

Thus, this study aimed to characterize rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria (RGM) isolated from the fish and to investigate their pathogenicity. Five RGM species were investigated, namely Mycobacterium chelonae, M. cosmeticum, M. farcinogenes, M. mucogenicum, and M. senegalense. The isolates were phenotypically and biochemically characterized and assessed for susceptibility to 18 antibiotics and five disinfectants. The pathogenicity of the isolated bacteria was evaluated through experimental infection of the fish by intraperitoneal injection. The results of phenotypic and biochemical typing allowed the identification of some of the isolates and provided preliminary information to distinguish between the bacteria. All isolates were resistant to at least four antibiotics, with multiple antibiotic resistance indexes ranging from 0.22 to 0.61, with M. chelonae having the highest value. Four disinfectants (i.e., ethanol, formalin, chlorine, and povidone‑iodine) showed strong antibacterial activity, whereas potassium permanganate proved less effective. An LD50 value within 7 days showed that M. chelonae had the highest virulence at 7.12 × 105 CFU/fish, followed by M. mucogenicum at 4.25 × 106 CFU/fish and a range of 1.01–1.65 × 107 CFU/fish for the other isolates. Depending on the dose and the isolate administered, some fish displayed acute disease symptoms, while others developed a chronic condition. The acute disease was characterized by short median survival, severe peritonitis, and tissue necrosis. Fish with a chronic infection survived the 42-day trial but were emaciated and had systemic granulomas within their viscera. The findings of this study have not only improved our understanding of the nature of these RGM species but also promoted the development of control strategies to mitigate the negative impact of mycobacteriosis on the Siamese fighting fish industry."
"['Numerical Analysis', 'Engineering (all)', 'Applied Mathematics']","Isogeometric gradient-free proportional topology optimization (IGA-PTO) for compliance problem  2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.This study presents the incorporation of the effective gradient-free proportional topology optimization algorithm into the framework of isogeometric analysis. The minimization of the compliance is considered, and the solid isotropic material with penalization method is used. The geometry, displacements, and density are all described by non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) basis functions. The density at an integration point is determined proportionally to its compliance. Then, the NURBS description of the density is constructed elementwise by deriving a relation between densities assigned to integration points and control points. The global NURBS description of the density for the whole domain is a blend of those from elements. Furthermore, a multiresolution scheme is presented by means of (Figure presented.) -refinement technique to enable the efficient performance for large-scale problems. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are assessed through six numerical examples, including two- and three-dimensional structures, with several rigorous tests and comparisons with the gradient-based optimality criteria algorithm."
"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Metals and Alloys', 'Materials Chemistry']","Role of anharmonicity in phonon-mediated superconductivity of quasi- van der Waals layered XP2 (X = As, Sb, Bi) structures: Insight from first-principles calculations  2023 Elsevier B.V.It is of utmost importance to prioritize the undertaking of investigating superconductivity, as it represents one of the most intriguing and significant phenomena in the field of condensed matter physics. Our research endeavors to shed light on the metallic state of van der Waals layered XP2 (X = As, Sb, Bi) structures, which is crucial in predicting their superconducting properties. Employing a first-principle evolutionary algorithm, we predicted the structures of phosphides, including AsP2, SbP2, and BiP2, and determined their energetically stable configurations under atmospheric pressure. To investigate the potential for superconductivity in these structures, we conducted a thorough examination of relevant electronic properties. One of the crucial factors we addressed was the role of anharmonic phonon properties in determining the superconducting state in van der Waals layered structures. Our findings suggest that the introduction of anharmonicity can significantly suppress the superconducting abilities of such structures. Hence, the anharmonicity present in AsP2, SbP2, and BiP2 could be held accountable for the lower observed superconducting critical temperature in these van der Waals layered structures."
"['Analytical Chemistry', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Biochemistry', 'Spectroscopy']","Capillary flow-driven immunoassay platform for COVID-19 antigen diagnostics  2023 Elsevier B.V.Over the last few years, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made the need for rapid, affordable diagnostics more compelling than ever. While traditional laboratory diagnostics like PCR and well-plate ELISA are sensitive and specific, they can be costly and take hours to complete. Diagnostic tests that can be used at the point-of-care or at home, like lateral flow assays (LFAs) are a simple, rapid alternative, but many commercially available LFAs have been criticized for their lack of sensitivity compared to laboratory methods like well-plate ELISAs. The Capillary-Driven Immunoassay (CaDI) device described in this work uses microfluidic channels and capillary action to passively automate the steps of a traditional well-plate ELISA for visual read out. This work builds on prior capillary-flow devices by further simplifying operation and use of colorimetric detection. Upon adding sample, an enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody, wash steps, and substrate are sequentially delivered to test and control lines on a nitrocellulose strip generating a colorimetric response. The end user can visually detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen in 15–20 min by naked eye, or results can be quantified using a smartphone and software such as ImageJ. An analytical detection limit of 83 PFU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 was determined for virus in buffer, and 222 PFU/mL for virus spiked into nasal swabs using image analysis, similar to the LODs determined by traditional well-plate ELISA. Additionally, a visual detection limit of 100 PFU/mL was determined in contrived nasal swab samples by polling 20 untrained end-users. While the CaDI device was used for detecting clinically relevant levels of SARS-CoV-2 in this study, the CaDI device can be easily adapted to other immunoassay applications by changing the reagents and antibodies."

To address this, PVDF photocatalytic hollow fiber membranes were prepared by coating with polydopamine (PDA) for 1–4 h, then with titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) in the current study. SEM and EDX results showed that TiO2 adhered firmly to the PDA-pretreated membrane after ultrasonic treatment. The PDA layer protected the membranes from UV irradiation. The PVDF-TiO2 membrane without PDA pretreatment was destroyed after 24 h of UV irradiation, while after 9 days of continuous irradiation, the membranes treated with PDA for 2 h remained unchanged. Compared with the original membrane, applying PVDF membranes coated with PDA for 2 h and TiO2 for 1 h increased the Reactive Red 239 rejection and flux recovery rates by 13% and 40%, respectively, achieving 60% COD removal. The permeate flux and dye rejection rate were stable after 5 cycles (20 h of operation). This study demonstrates that the obtained membranes can perform prolonged membrane filtration with high-performance durability for dye wastewater treatment."

The qualitative information was collected from 91 respondents, including 33 individuals who participated in key informant interviews (KIIs) and 58 individuals who joined ten focus group discussions (FGDs) (5–7 persons per FGD). Our results showed that pig farmers, farm workers, and villagers lacked SIV-related knowledge and did not employ preventive measures. Some respondents had limited access to information about causes, clinical symptoms, treatment, and appropriate practices resulting in inadequate knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding zoonotic diseases, especially SIV. Some pig farmers and farm workers reported seeking information about SIV infection from various sources; however, relevant authorities lacked dissemination of information regarding SIV to community members. The study suggested that healthcare personnel and relevant agencies should adopt a community-based approach to prevent swine influenza. This can be achieved by organizing health education and community communication interventions and involving those who have had contact with pigs or reside near pig farms. This will help increase community awareness and knowledge of swine influenza."

The raw material selection is the important procedure for real industrial production. The effect of biomass structural composition in feedstock on ethanol production is therefore needed to explore for feedstock selection. According to the previous research studies, the fermentation process includes pre-treatment and fermentation of sugar to ethanol. This study focuses on the simulation of raw material variation in ethanol production especially the structural composition of carbohydrate that contains three main components, cellulose, xylan, and lignin, in the fermentation section. The simulation model is validated by the data of previous study information with small deviation. The mixture design method is used for result interpretation and analysis. From the design of experiment, there are 14 scenarios and the selected response parameter is the mass fraction of ethanol in outlet stream of fermentation section. From the results, the maximum mass fraction of ethanol in outlet stream is in the scenario which has a large amount of cellulose and xylan fractions. This is because the conversion of reaction in the fermentation reactor mostly consumes cellulose and xylan to produce glucose and xylose, respectively, and converts them into ethanol product. From the overall result of this study, the important of raw material selection in ethanol production is illustrated."

However, its poor aqueous solubility limits its ocular bioavailability. In this study, we sought to increase the aqueous solubility of TAC by complexation with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD). Moreover, we aimed to develop novel eye drop formulations by loading TAC into Zein nanoparticles (ZnNP), or nanoemulsions (NE) stabilized by ZnNP, with and without HPβCD. All four TAC formulations exhibited excellent physicochemical characteristics and were physically stable for at least 2 h in simulated tear fluid. However, among the formulations, TAC/HPβCD-loaded NE stabilized by Zn NP (TAC/CD-NE) showed the highest entrapment efficiency and mucoadhesive properties. It was also non-toxic to Statens Seruminstitut rabbit corneal (SIRC) and retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells. Moreover, TAC/CD-NE was more efficiently taken up by the ARPE-19 cells compared to TAC suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and exhibited enhanced anti-VEGF activity, as evidenced by decreased VEGF mRNA and protein levels. TAC/CD-NE remained physically and chemically stable for up to three months under refrigerated conditions. Collectively, our findings suggest that TAC/CD-loaded NE stabilized by ZnNP safely and effectively delivers TAC and represents a promising eye drop formulation for retinal disease treatment."

Indeed, PM2.5 exposure causes detrimental health problems in the general population. Estimating the short- and long-term health impacts of PM2.5 exposure should help to shape public health policy concerning air pollution. Hence, this study sought to estimate the rate of premature death attributable to PM2.5 exposure among the Thai population if the PM2.5 concentration met the applied counterfactual factor. The PM2.5 concentration, population numbers, and numbers of health incidences were collected from secondary data sources in 2019. A health impact analysis was performed using AirQ+ software to estimate the incidences of premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 exposure. More specifically, the analysis provided the estimated proportion of attributable cases and the rate of premature death per 100,000 population aged ≥ 30 years. The annual average PM2.5 concentration in Thailand was found to be 24.15 µg per cubic meter (μg/m3) in 2019, while the natural mortality rate was around 1,107 per 100,000 population nationwide. With regard to short-term PM2.5 exposure, it was determined that 8 premature deaths per 100,000 population could be prevented if the PM2.5 concentration met the World Health Organization (WHO) short-term gold standard of 15 μg/m3. Moreover, 159 premature deaths per 100,000 population could be avoided if the PM2.5 concentration met the WHO’s long-term gold standard of 5 μg/m3. This estimation of premature deaths due to the short- and long-term impacts of PM2.5 exposure can support policymakers and stakeholders in creating a roadmap to combating the adverse impacts of PM2.5 exposure and protect the health of the Thai population."

A systemic literature review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines to select proper references to give an overview of DENV infection. Results indicate that understanding the virus characteristics and epidemiology are essential to gain the basic and clinical knowledge as well as dengue disseminated pattern and status. Different factors and mechanisms are thought to be involved in the presentation of DHF and DSS, including antibody-dependent enhancement, immune dysregulation, viral virulence, host genetic susceptibility, and preexisting dengue antibodies.

We selected 90 participants, 60 Long COVID patients and 30 individuals without any symptoms following acute COVID-19 infection. Using cluster analysis and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAMA) score, the pure HAMA anxiety score, serum tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenine (KYN), the KYN/TRP ratio (all measured during Long COVID), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) (measured during the acute phase of COVID-19), we were able to classify Long COVID patients into two distinct clusters with an adequate silhouette cohesion and separation index (0.58): cluster 1 (n = 61) and cluster 2 (n = 29). Cluster 2 patients had lower SpO2 and TRP levels, as well as higher KYN, KYN/TRP ratio, and HAMA scores than cluster 1. Regression analysis revealed that the KYN/TRP ratio explained 14.4 % of the variance in the HAMA score (F = 14.81, df = 1/88, p = 0.001). In addition, regression analysis revealed that SpO2 partially explained the variance in serum TRP (r = 0.396, p = 0.005), KYN/TRP ratio (r = − 0.248, p = 0.018), and the HAMA score (r = − 0.279, p = 0.008). The current data imply that decreased SpO2 during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection is predictive of anxiety caused by Long COVID. Our data reveal that around 32 % of Long COVID patients have elevated IDO activity in association with elevated anxiety."

This paper reports a review of literatures on urban public spaces attempting to gauge the research gaps on public spaces through a scoping-review analysis of relevant studies. The review of relevant literatures published from 1990 to 2023 led to an inference that there is a huge gap in defining the publicness (non-excludable and non-rival) of the public spaces in Nepal. Furthermore, knowledge about public spaces is found to be scattered. However, all Nepal-based research identified that open spaces in Kathmandu valley were severely encroached upon. Rapid urbanization, along with a lack of resilient urban planning and governance, appears to have a significant influence on urban public spaces and social cohesion, as well as diseconomies in emerging economies. Social inequalities, health disparities, environmental injustice, economic instability and stifled cultural expression are all intricately bound to urban public spaces, particularly green public space, which still remains a research priority for new evidence-based urban policymakers and urban planners in developing countries. Future research should therefore focus on a multilevel approach preferably using network model to cover and comprehend the societal-benefits of public space, extending large-scale quantitative assessments with field evaluations of each public space, community surveys, and other qualitative research in Nepal. Component-wise research gaps are also evidently explored in the course of separate domains."

Methods: This open-label, multicenter, post-marketing surveillance study evaluated the safety (events of special interest [ESIs]; primary end point) and effectiveness of 46 weeks of CT-P13 treatment according to routine practice in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), with 1 year follow-up post-treatment. Results: 30 patients were enrolled (16 RA, 8 AS and 6 PsA). Infections were the most frequently reported study drug-related ESIs (2 RA and 2 AS). One patient with RA and one with PsA experienced infusion-related reactions. No cases of tuberculosis, malignancy (as expected, given 1 year follow-up), or drug-induced liver disease were reported. Disease activity improved across indications. Conclusion: CT-P13 was well tolerated and effective across indications.Infliximab is one biological medicine used to treat inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). CT-P13 is a near-identical copy, called a biosimilar, of the original (‘reference’) version of infliximab. CT-P13 is the first biosimilar to receive regulatory approval for treatment of the same three diseases from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration. Biosimilarity means that CT-P13 does not differ from the original version of infliximab in clinically important ways, such as how safe it is and how well it works. CT-P13 and reference infliximab provided similar symptom relief during previous clinical trials, and both drugs caused similar side effects. It is important to monitor the safety and performance of CT-P13 when given during routine clinical practice, and in different ethnic populations, such as through the study reported here. Following regulatory approval in Thailand, 30 patients prescribed CT-P13 during routine clinical practice participated in this study. The study included 16 patients with RA, eight with AS and six with PsA. The patients took CT-P13 for 46 weeks and were monitored for a further year. Side effects of CT-P13 were as expected based on previous experience and did not raise any safety concerns. Based on the known safety profile of CT-P13, the study looked at some side effects in particular: infections were the most common of these side effects, experienced by 16 patients overall (seven patients with RA, five patients with AS and four patients with PsA). CT-P13 improved symptoms for all of the diseases. The study suggests that CT-P13 can be given safely and reduces symptoms in Thai patients with AS, RA or PsA.

Consequently, there is an urgent demand for innovative strategies that demonstrate exceptional antibacterial efficiency to effectively combat these resilient pathogens. This study aimed to investigate the efficiency of extraction of anthocyanins-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) as an antibacterial agent against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus-902. The anthocyanins were extracted from three different berries: mulberry, blackberry, and blackcurrant. The Fe3O4 NPs were synthesized using the co-precipitation method with FeCl2·4H2O and FeCl3·6H2O metal precursors. Furthermore, anthocyanins were coated onto the surface of Fe3O4 through a simple sonication process, followed by the freeze-drying, resulting in Fe3O4/bionanocomposites (BNC). The mulberry, blackberry, and black currant-derived anthocyanins coated Fe3O4 were labelled as Fe3O4/MB, Fe3O4/BB, and Fe3O4/BC, respectively. The resulting Fe3O4/BNCs were analyzed using various spectroscopy and microscopic techniques. The XRD results showed that the Fe3O4/BNC formed a face-centred cubic structure, with particle size determined debye-Scherrer's equation, and the obtained particle size was 15–18 nm. Finally, the obtained Fe3O4/BNC was used as an antibacterial agent against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus-902. The Fe3O4/BNC exhibited strong antibacterial activity against bacterial species. Thus, this study offers a competitive approach to create recyclable antibacterial materials with specific antibacterial therapeutic properties."

The morphological characters of Pachypanthera n. gen., notably the large and powerful canine, the great robustness of the mandibular body, the very deep fossa for the m. masseter, the zigzag HSB enamel pattern, indicate bone-cracking capacities. The genus is unique among Felidae as it has one of the most powerful and robust mandibles ever found. Moreover, it may be the oldest known pantherine, as other Asian pantherines are dated back to the early Pliocene. The taxa we report here are the only carnivorans known from the late Miocene of Thailand. Although the material is rather scarce, it brings new insights to the evolutionary history of Neogene mammals of Southeast Asia, in a geographic place which is partly “terra incognita.”"

Methods: We undertook a randomised controlled trial from 10/2018 to 05/2021. Participants with early stage psychosis (< 5 year duration) were recruited using convenience sampling from the caseloads of community psychiatric nurses in Thailand and randomly allocated to either the Thai Health Improvement Profile intervention or treatment as usual group following baseline assessment. Outcome assessors were blind to group allocation, whereas participants were not. Participants in the intervention group received three monthly (five in total) systematic health checks using the Thai Health Improvement Profile tool, which was used to develop a personal health plan in collaboration with a family member/carer. Nurses supported participants to implement the health plan using behaviour change techniques derived from motivational interviewing. The treatment as usual group consisted of medication and psychosocial support, and no additional intervention was provided. The primary outcome was weight gain (defined as a greater or equal to 7 % increase in weight against baseline) within 1 year. Results: Fifty-three participants were allocated to the intervention and an equal number to the treatment as usual group. Primary outcome data were available for 30 participants in each group at the 12 month follow-up. We undertook an intention to treat analysis with multiple imputation (to handle the missing data) for the primary outcome. The treatment as usual group was found to have higher odds than the Thai Health Improvement Profile intervention group of gaining ≥ 7 % of baseline body weight (OR = 6.52; 95 % CI: 1.88–22.65, p = 0.004). Conclusions: The Thai Health Improvement Profile intervention was effective at preventing weight gain in people with early stage psychosis at one year, though attrition was relatively high. The results highlight the need for community mental health nurses to adopt a holistic approach, the potential benefits of conducting regular comprehensive health checks and the importance of involving family members when aiming to improve the physical health of people diagnosed with early stage psychosis. A large definitive multi-site randomised controlled trial of the Thai Health Improvement Profile with a longer follow-up is now justified.

Objectives: To systematically review and meta-analyze all data concerning biomarkers of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), lipid-associated antioxidants, lipid peroxidation products, and autoimmune responses to oxidatively modified lipid epitopes in MDD and BD. Methods: Databases including PubMed, Google scholar and SciFinder were searched to identify eligible studies from inception to January 10th, 2023. Guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results: The current meta-analysis included 176 studies (60 BD and 116 MDD) and examined 34,051 participants, namely 17,094 with affective disorders and 16,957 healthy controls. Patients with MDD and BD showed a) significantly decreased RCT (mainly lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and paraoxonase 1); b) lowered lipid soluble vitamins (including vitamin A, D, and coenzyme Q10); c) increased lipid peroxidation and aldehyde formation, mainly increased malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal, peroxides, and 8-isoprostanes; and d) Immunoglobulin (Ig)G responses to oxidized low-density lipoprotein and IgM responses to MDA. The ratio of all lipid peroxidation biomarkers/all lipid-associated antioxidant defenses was significantly increased in MDD (standardized mean difference or SMD = 0.433; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.312; 0.554) and BD (SMD = 0.653; CI: 0.501–0.806). This ratio was significantly greater in BD than MDD (p = 0.027). Conclusion: In MDD/BD, lowered RCT, a key antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathway, may drive increased lipid peroxidation, aldehyde formation, and autoimmune responses to oxidative specific epitopes, which all together cause increased immune-inflammatory responses and neuro-affective toxicity."
"['Analytical Chemistry', 'Spectroscopy']","Synergistic redox of dual-shaped silver nanostructures for highly selective sensing of hydrogen peroxide  2023 Elsevier B.V.A novel growth-based plasmonic sensor for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) determination was developed from dual-shaped silver nanostructures consisting of starch-stabilized yellow silver nanospheres (AgNSs) and citrate-capped red silver nanoprisms (AgNPrs). AgNPrs were enlarged through a unique mechanism of AgNSs dissolution to silver ions which are subsequently reduced to silver metal by H2O2. Citrate-capping maintains the lateral anisotropic growth by protecting the AgNPrs from oxidation while exposing the sensitive edges to Ostwald ripening. This highly unique process addresses the selectivity issues encountered with decomposition-based AgNSs/NPrs sensors. Absorbance values from the AgNSs decomposition and AgNPrs growth facilitated a more sensitive spectrophotometric assay through ratiometric analysis. Increasing the concentration of the AgNSs/NPrs sensor to 80:40 ppm also improved sensitivity of naked eye detection of H2O2 by generating a wide range of color transitions. Furthermore, selectivity, accuracy and precision evaluation suggest that the dual-shaped silver nanostructure sensor is a potential alternative to H2O2 determination by allowing a simple, rapid, highly selective, and sensitive measurement."

In order to characterize Wolbachia sp., the nested PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene showed that all samples of Dirofilaria immitis and fifteen samples of Candidatus Dirofilaria hongkongensis were grouped into Wolbachia supergroup C. In addition, all samples of Brugia spp. and five samples of Candidatus Dirofilaria hongkongensis were classified into Wolbachia supergroup D. The genetic diversity analysis conducted using the 16S rRNA gene revealed a similar result when analyzed through phylogenetic tree analysis. This is the first genetic diversity study of Wolbachia of Candidatus Dirofilaria hongkongensis in infected dogs in Thailand."

To remove 2-MBT, this study investigated the bioaugmentation of activated sludge with a 2-MBT-degrading bacterial consortium, which was previously enriched from rubber wastewater sludge. The consortium was immobilized in a commercial porous carrier to increase its efficiency and stability. The 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that the dominant Pseudomonas spp. and Stenotrophomonas spp. were maintained when it was repeatedly used for 4 cycles in a minimal medium containing 300 mg L−1 2-MBT. For bioaugmentation, a stirred tank reactor containing the immobilized consortium and activated sludge at a 1:2 mass ratio was constructed and found to remove 88.2 % of 100 mg L−1 2-MBT from synthetic wastewater. When the rubber industrial wastewater was applied at an organic loading rate (OLR) range of 1.0–3.0 kg COD m−3 d−1, the bioaugmentation reactor had 2-MBT and COD removal efficiencies of 70–79 % and 83–96 %, respectively. The reactors with either immobilized consortium or activated sludge alone had lower treatment efficiency. The bacterial community and its predicted functions corresponded to the activity of the added consortium and the operation of the reactor. Consequently, bioaugmentation should be applied to activated sludge for the treatment of rubber wastewater."

These catalysts reacted with TEA presented higher catalytic activity than using TnOA. This is due to TEA had higher reducing power. Moreover, it revealed that ZN-MGE exhibited the highest activity among other catalysts because ZN-MGE had the highest distribution of titanium contents measured by EDX, and then generated more active sites. The average particle sizes of these catalysts were around 35 µm, which was suitable for commercial application. Considering copolymer size, the size of EH-ZN-O-TEA and EH-ZN-MGE-TnOA (ca. 420 µm) displayed the largest particle size. The large size of EH-ZN-MGE-TnOA was expected due to the agglomeration and steric hindrance of the catalyst reacted with TnOA. For the particle size distribution, only EH-ZN-O-TEA showed the bimodal distribution meaning that both fragmentation and no fragmentation occurred. Other copolymers showed positive-skewed distribution. Typically, the morphologies of copolymer were spheroidal lump without fine particles. The roles of comonomer content on thermal behaviors were presented by melting temperature, C7-soluble content, and crystallinity. It was found that although all catalysts with TEA exhibited higher activity than TnOA, the use of TnOA perhaps tended to facilitate the comonomer insertion. It revealed that steric hindrance of TnOA cocatalyst may retard the copolymer chain attachment. As the result, the comonomer insertion of EH-ZN-MGE was the highest among other catalysts."
"['Analytical Chemistry', 'Spectroscopy']","Evaluation of electrochemical behavior combined with the sensitive and selective determination of ceftriaxone using molecularly imprinted polymer-based sensor  2023 Elsevier B.V.Understanding the electrochemical behavior of antibiotic drugs could help develop sensors for selective and sensitive detection at trace levels due to their importance in food safety and environmental protection. In this work, we studied and evaluated the electrochemical behavior of ceftriaxone (CEF) using a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the first step. Differential pulse voltammetry and Cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used in this evaluation. CV showed that CEF has an oxidation peak at 0.926 V, while oxidation takes the best place in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution as an electrolyte. On the other hand, the relationship between Ep and pH showed an equal number of protons and electrons are involved in the oxidization process, while the slope value obtained from the equation plotted between logIp and logυ (0.83) showed the diffusion-adsorption mix controlled oxidation of CEF. Using these conditions, CEF on GCE showed a linearity range between 1.0 × 10−7 and 7.5 × 10−6 M with LOD equal to 2.57 × 10−8 M. However, in order to increase the selectivity and sensitivity of GCE, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based sensor was developed in the next part of this work. Herein, the photopolymerization technique was chosen to design the MIP on GCE using 4-amino benzoic acid (4-ABA) as a monomer. The LODs of the standard solutions and serum sample were 1.15 × 10−17 M and 1.19 × 10−17 M, respectively, while the linear range was between 1.0 × 10−16 and 1.0 × 10−15 M. Furthermore, interference effect evaluation and imprinting factor analysis were performed with selected interfering compounds and using cefuroxime, cefdinir, ceftazidime pentahydrate, cefazolin, and cefixime to demonstrate the sensor's selectivity. Moreover, the execution of the MIP sensor was confirmed by a non-imprinted polymer-based sensor. Finally, 4-ABA/CEF@MIP-GCE was used to find out CEF in commercial serum and tap water samples precisely."

Effects of different weight ratios of TiO2 and WO3 in nanocomposites, types of hole scavenger (Na2S2O3, C2H5OH, Na2S2O3/C2H5OH), concentrations of Na2S2O3 (0–100 mM) and photocatalyst loading (1–4 g/L) were examined. The preliminary results demonstrated that the employed wet chemical process induced a well formation of TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites with better textural properties as well as a more negative band position than the pristine WO3. The presence of mixed hole scavengers of Na2S2O3 and C2H5OH played a crucial role on the photocatalytic gold recovery from the cyanide-based gold plating wastewater. A more stable form of gold cyanide ([Au(CN)2]-) was altered to a less stable form ([Au(S2O3)2]3-) by the addition of Na2S2O3. At the end, approximately 85.9 % and 98.2 % of gold were respectively recovered within 180 and 300 min via the T6/WO3 nanocomposite in the presence of 10 mM Na2S2O3 and 20 vol% C2H5OH at photocatalyst loading of 2 g/L and light intensity of 3.20 mW/cm2. The photocatalytic gold recovery was significantly improved via the 1st reused T6/WO3 nanocomposite, in which 99.9 % of gold was recovered within 180 min. The obtained results can pave the way for the design of novel TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites for gold recovery as well as the strategy of waste management for the practical operation."

Pakistan experienced devastating flooding, leading to numerous fatalities, extensive destruction of homes, and millions of displaced or otherwise affected individuals. Using survey data from households in Chitral District, we apply indicators from the literature on exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to generate actual vulnerability scores for households. We then determine household-level risk as a function of vulnerability and hazard. Finally, we employ Kruskal–Wallis one-way variance analysis to measure the association between household risk and flood impact in terms of both agricultural and non-agricultural losses. The findings indicate that loss due to floods is not a random function of nature's impact; instead, households with higher levels of risk also face higher agricultural and non-agricultural losses. These results emphasize the importance of addressing underlying risk factors to reduce household vulnerability rather than simply responding to post-crisis emergencies."

However, the bio-inertness of PEEK's surface has limited its applications. Ambient sulfonation has been adopted to enhance bioactivity, but its nanoscale topographic changes are insufficient for implant-bone interlock. To further improve bone-implant interlock, this study employs CO2 laser machining to create sub-millimeter (0.5 mm) grooves on PEEK's surface, aiming to encourage bone ingrowth and strengthen the implant-bone interface. This research investigated the physical and chemical properties and bio-interaction of PEEK surface modified by sulfonation (SPEEK), laser machining (L-PEEK), and combination of both technique (L-SPEEK). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra revealed that sulfonation compensates for the surface chemical shift instigated by laser ablation, aligning the surface chemistry of L-SPEEK with that of SPEEK. Furthermore, L-PEEK surfaces presented pores with sizes ranging from 1 to 600 μm, while SPEEK surfaces exhibited pores between 5 and 700 nm. All tested samples demonstrated non-cytotoxicity, with L-SPEEK exhibiting the highest mineralization and ALP activity as 2 and 2.1 times that of intrinsic PEEK, after 21 days of incubation. Microscopic imaging reveals a notably higher extracellular content on L-SPEEK compared to the other groups. This study underscores the potential of combining sub-millimeter laser machining with sulfonation in enhancing early osteogenic markers, providing a promising pathway for future PEEK-based orthopedic applications."

The objective of this study was to report thalassemia-related complications and risk factors in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with TDT. Methods: A multicenter web-based registry was conducted in patients with TDT aged 25 years and younger from eight university hospitals covering all parts of Thailand. Factors significantly associated with each complication were analyzed by logistic regression methods. Results: Of 605 patients, 267 thalassemia-related complications were reported from 231 pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with TDT patients (38.2%). The most common complications were infections, followed by cholelithiasis and growth failure. Splenectomy and elevated pre-transfusion hemoglobin were statistically significant risk factors for infections (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–4.5, p-value =.01 and AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2–1.7, p-value <.005, respectively). There were two statistically significant risk factors conferred endocrinopathies, including older age (AOR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01–1.1, p-value =.01) and being male (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.4–4.0, p-value =.002). Conclusion: Nearly 40% of the patients in this cohort had thalassemia-related complications. Periodic surveillance and optimal care for respective complications may minimize comorbidities in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with TDT."

Positively charged colistin binds to negatively charged lipids and damages the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. However, the MCR-1 protein, encoded by the mobile colistin resistance (mcr) gene, is involved in bacterial colistin resistance by catalysing phosphoethanolamine (PEA) transfer onto lipid A, neutralising its negative charge, and thereby reducing its interaction with colistin. Our preliminary results showed that treatment with a reference pyrazolone compound significantly reduced colistin minimal inhibitory concentrations in Escherichia coli expressing mcr-1 mediated colistin resistance (Hanpaibool et al. in ACS Omega, 2023). A docking-MD combination was used in an ensemble-based docking approach to identify further pyrazolone compounds as candidate MCR-1 inhibitors. Docking simulations revealed that 13/28 of the pyrazolone compounds tested are predicted to have lower binding free energies than the reference compound. Four of these were chosen for in vitro testing, with the results demonstrating that all the compounds tested could lower colistin MICs in an E. coli strain carrying the mcr-1 gene. Docking of pyrazolones into the MCR-1 active site reveals residues that are implicated in ligand–protein interactions, particularly E246, T285, H395, H466, and H478, which are located in the MCR-1 active site and which participate in interactions with MCR-1 in ≥ 8/10 of the lowest energy complexes. This study establishes pyrazolone-induced colistin susceptibility in E. coli carrying the mcr-1 gene, providing a method for the development of novel treatments against colistin-resistant bacteria."

A series of nonlinear finite element (FE) analyses is first performed to define the optimal shape and dimensions of the joint. The FE analysis results show that the most effective joint shape is the 45° key joint, as it does not induce an overly high stress concentration at the joint. Therefore, fourteen UHPC segments connected with optimal joint configurations are prepared and tested under bending and shear loads. Several parameters, such as prestressing force, joint depth, the number of shear keys, and the presence of dowels, that affect the flexural and shear capacities of the UHPC segment are experimentally examined. The experimental results indicate that by inducing the prestressing forces, both flexural and shear performance predominantly increase, and higher ductile behavior in the UHPC segments can be achieved. Moreover, the presence of dowel bars and double shear keys can significantly retard crack opening at the joints under flexure and shear loading, respectively. This is because both dowel bars and key joints can facilitate the transfer of higher stresses across the joint. Additionally, the joint depth contributes positively to the stiffness and loading capacity of the UHPC segmental joints."

The wet biomass was utilized for direct transesterification using potassium carbonate as catalyst. The reaction parameters such as solvent to algae ratio, water addition, catalyst concentration, temperature, and reaction time parameters were optimized. Under optimized conditions (20 ml/g solvent to algae ratio, 40% water addition, 4% catalyst, 60 °C and 60 min), a yield of 93% methyl ester yield was achieved. The obtained methyl ester showed satisfactory fuel properties. The spent biomass after transesterification was further subjected to hydrolysis using H2SO4 combined with ultrasound. The sugar content in the hydrolysate accounted for 92% sugar recovery which was further used for the itaconic acid production using Aspergillus sp. The itaconic acid production was improved by altering the MgSO4 concentration in the medium. Addition of TCA cycle metabolites further enhanced the itaconic acid production. Under optimized conditions (50 g/l sugar, 5 ml inoculum, 0.4 g/l MgSO4, 4 mM citric acid, 37 °C for 7 days with 120 rpm), a maximum itaconic production yield of 0.0692 g/g of Scenedesmus sp. was achieved when 4 mM citric acid was added to the medium which suggested an important role of TCA cycle to supply intermediates for the synthesis of itaconic acid."

However, recent investigations have revealed that these interactions are often nonlinear. As a result, machine learning (ML) techniques are being used to model these nonlinear interactions instead of traditional statistical methods. This has the potential to improve research into the relationship between the built environment and travel behavior. However, while there have been rigorous reviews of traditional methods for assessing linear impacts, the technical aspects of applying ML methods to evaluate nonlinear connections have not been thoroughly reviewed. To address this gap, this study examines the technical aspects of applying ML methods to analyze nonlinear correlations between the built environment and travel behavior. The review identifies state-of-the-art strategies for modeling the relationship between the built environment and travel behavior using ML techniques and highlights methodological shortcomings in previous research. The review is based on a comprehensive search of three main online publishing sources, which yielded 41 distinct papers. The review extracted 11 qualities encompassing five research questions: application domains, ML approaches, datasets, performance assessment, and hyper-parameter optimization. Additionally, the study identified ten technical issues that may impact the effectiveness of the ML models. Of these, three were identified as technical matters of concern that may introduce bias in the evaluation of model effectiveness. Seven were identified as potential enhancements that may improve the model's effectiveness. Finally, four more general issues were identified as potential areas for future research."

The Academic Research Consortium (ARC) have identified a set of clinical criteria to standardize the definition of a high bleeding risk (HBR). Current study sought to externally validate the ARC definition for HBR patients in a contemporary real-world cohort. Method: This post hoc analysis included 22,741 patients undergoing PCI between May 2018 and August 2019 enrolled in Thai PCI Registry. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major bleeding at 12 months post index PCI. Results: In total, 8678 (38.2%) and 14,063 (61.8%) patients were stratified to the ARC-HBR and non-ARC-HBR groups, respectively. Incidence of major bleeding was 3.3 and 1.1 per 1000 patients per month in the ARC-HBR group and the non-ARC-HBR group (HR 2.84 [95% CI: 2.39–3.38]; p < 0.001). Advanced age and heart failure met the 1-year major criteria performance goal of ≥4% major bleeding. The impact of HBR risk factors was incremental. HBR patients also experienced significantly higher rates of all-cause mortality (19.1% versus 5.2%, HR 4.00 [95% CI: 3.67–4.37]; p < 0.001) and myocardial infarction. The ARC-HBR score fairly performed in discriminating bleeding with C-statistic (95% CI) of 0.674 (0.649, 0.698). Updating the ARC-HBR by adding heart failure, prior myocardial infarction, non-radial access, female in the model significantly improved C-statistic of 0.714 (0.691, 0.737). Conclusions: The ARC-HBR definition could identify patients at increased risk not only for bleeding but also for thrombotic events, including all-cause mortality. Coexistence of multiple ARC-HBR criteria unveiled additive prognostic value."
['Chemistry (all)'],"Facile construction of a water-defendable Li anode protection enables rechargeable Li-O2 battery operating in humid atmosphere  2023The rechargeable Li-O2 battery endowed with high theoretical specific energy density has sparked intense research interest as a promising energy storage system. However, the intrinsic high activity of Li anode, especially to moisture, usually leads to inferior electrochemical performance of Li-O2 battery in humid environments, hindering its widespread application. To settle the trouble of poor moisture tolerance, fabricating a water-proof layer on the Li-metal anode could be an effective tactic. Herein, a facile strategy for constructing an ibuprofen-based protective layer on the Li anode has been proposed to realize highly rechargeable Li-O2 battery in humid atmosphere. Due to the in-situ reaction between ibuprofen reagent and metallic Li, the protective layer with a thickness of ∼30 µm has been uniformly deposited on the surface of Li anode. Particularly, the protective layer, consisting of a large amount of hydrophobic alkyl group and benzene ring, can significantly resist water ingress and enhance the electrochemical stability of Li anode. As a result, the Li-O2 battery based on the protected Li anode achieves a long cycle life of 210 h (21 cycles at 1000 mAh/g, 200 mA/g) in highly moist atmosphere with relative humidity (RH) of 68%. This convenient and efficient strategy offers novel design concept of water-resistant metal anode, and paves the way to the promising future prospect for the high-energy Li-O2 battery implementing in the ambient atmosphere."

It can not only improve hypoxia but also promote pulmonary annulus (PA) growth. In this study, we evaluated the effect of PBPV on PA growth in infants with TOF. To eliminate the effect of the systemic to pulmonary shunt (SPS) that may promote PA growth, we divided TOF infants into 2 groups: group A, patients who underwent PBPV with or without other SPS, and group B, patients who attempted SPS but without PBPV. Sixty patients were included, 28 patients in group A and 32 patients in group B. Age at the time of intervention in group A (range, 0.4–5.4; median 1.4 months) was lower than that in group B (range, 2.3–7.7; median 4.8 months), p-value 0.02.

Spectral power distribution (SPD) during daylight in summer and winter were recorded to create a dynamic artificial lighting system that best matches the natural daylight characteristics. Two set-ups light emitting diode (LED) (LED-A and LED-B) were screened, developed, validated and compared with different chromaticity layouts of the correlated color temperatures (CCTs) allocated on Planckian locus and later converted to x-y co-ordinates in a chromaticity diagram. Based on CCT and Duv deviations between two developed setups, LED-A could mimick circadian points on the chromaticity diagram better than LED-B did. CCT and Duv values of LED-A (δCCT=3.75% and δDuv=17.36%) can match closer to the daylight than those of LED-B (δCCT=5.0 % and δDuv=56.84%). For CIE-standard melanopic performances (melanopic efficacy of luminous radiation (mELR), melanopic equivalent daylight (D65) illuminance (mEDI) and melanopic daylight efficacy ratio (mDER)), LED-A is suitable to use indoor with averages of 1.16 W·lm-1, 236 lx and 0.84, respectively, while LED-B is good to use outdoor with averages of 1.53 W·lm-1, 266 lx and 1.06, respectively.

"['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Chemistry (all)', 'Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","A novel recycling route for aluminum alloys: Synthesis of Fe/Al bimetallic materials and magnetic separation  2023 Elsevier LtdAluminum (Al) is one of the most important non-ferrous metals used in modern society, but its production from primary ores (e.g., bauxite) requires high energy input, emits large CO2, and generates huge amounts of solid wastes. In contrast, the production of Al from recycled scrap—also known as secondary Al production—only requires 5–8% of the energy for producing Al from bauxite and generates less amount of solid waste than that of the primary Al production, thus having both economic and environmental benefits. In general, scrap Al alloys are treated by physical-based separation techniques to remove impurities, and then mixed aluminum alloys are charged into the furnace for further refining. The ideal way of recycling Al scrap is to process each Al alloy by remelting/refining processes. To this end, this study investigated the surface modification of aluminum alloys by iron (Fe) deposition, followed by their separation by magnetic separation. When Al powder was treated with an acidified ferrous chloride solution (FeCl2-HCl-NaCl solution), dissolved Fe concentration decreased with time while releasing Al3+ into the solution, indicating that Fe cementation on Al occurred. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of treated Al powder showed that its surface was covered with zero-valent iron (ZVI) as well as its oxidation products (e.g., Fe(II)/Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide). The synthesis of Fe/Al bimetallic materials from Al alloys—1050, 2024, 3003, 5083, 6061, and 7075—was strongly dependent on HCl concentration as well as reaction temperature. Moreover, the kinetics of Fe cementation on Al alloys and the amounts of Fe cemented were determined not only by the rest potentials of the Al alloys but also their corrosion resistance. After treating Al alloys with FeCl2-HCl-NaCl solution, each Al alloy could be sequentially recovered by magnetic separation."

MIL-88B(Fe)-derived carbon at 900 ºC (CMIL88–900) exhibited great increases in surface area, porosity, and hydrophobicity, resulting in the excellent adsorption rates and capacities of five I-THMs (4–44 times calculated by linear isotherm) compared to powdered activated carbon (PAC). The primary adsorptive mechanisms onto CMIL88–900 consists of hydrophobic partitioning and an ion-dipole interaction at the acidic surface functional groups (ASGs), which is supported by the diffusibility of the small molecular structure of I-THMs. Bromodiiodomethane demonstrated the highest competitive adsorption capacity on CMIL88–900 in single- and mixed-solute solutions due to it having the highest hydrophobicity and smallest molecular structure. MIL-53(Al)-derived carbon at 900 ºC (CMIL53–900) showed comparable I-THMs adsorption capacities with PAC, approximately 10 times lower than those detected from CMIL88–900. The ion-dipole interaction between the I-THMs and ASGs of CMIL53–900 served as the dominant adsorptive mechanism. Chlorinated haloform showed higher adsorption capacity on CMIL88–900 than brominated and iodinated haloforms. Among the three dominant I-DBPs, dichloroiodomethane had the highest adsorption capacity on CMIL88–900 compared to iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide, respectively, due to its hydrophobicity and having the lowest molecular weight."

"['Biotechnology', 'Biophysics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Electrochemistry']","Paper-based electrochemical immunosensor for the determination of symmetric dimethylarginine  2023 The AuthorsIn this work, we present the development of an immunosensor for the direct, selective, and sensitive determination of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in urine, in view of the emerging role of this molecule as a biomarker for renal disease. SDMA is almost completely excreted by the kidneys, hence in renal dysfunction, the excretion is decreased, resulting in accumulation in plasma. Reference values for plasma or serum have already been established in small animal practice. Values < 15 μg/dL are considered normal, 15–19 μg/dL are values of concern, and at values > 20 μg/dL kidney disease is likely. The proposed electrochemical paper-based sensing platform uses anti-SDMA antibodies for targeted detection of SDMA. Quantification is related to a decrease in the signal of a redox indicator due to the formation of an immunocomplex that interferes with electron transfer. Square wave voltammetry measurements showed a linear correlation of the peak decline for 50 nM - 1 μM SDMA with a detection limit of 15 nM. The influence of common physiological interferences caused no significant peak reduction, indicating excellent selectivity. The proposed immunosensor was successfully applied for the quantification of SDMA in human urine of healthy individuals. Surveillance of SDMA concentration in urine could prove to be very valuable in the diagnosis or monitoring of renal disease."

Deep learning-based image reconstruction is a relatively new technique that uses deep convolutional neural networks to improve image quality. Objective: To evaluate and compare 1.25 mm thin-section abdominal CT images reconstructed with deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) with 5 mm thick images reconstructed with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR-V). Methods: This retrospective study included 52 patients (31 F; 56.9±16.9 years) who underwent abdominal CT scans between August-October 2019. Image reconstruction was performed to generate 5 mm images at 40% ASIR-V and 1.25 mm DLIR images at three strengths (low [DLIR-L], medium [DLIR-M], and high [DLIR-H]). Qualitative assessment was performed to determine image noise, contrast, visibility of small structures, sharpness, and artifact based on a 5-point-scale. Image preference determination was based on a 3-point-scale. Quantitative assessment included measurement of attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR). Results: Thin-section images reconstructed with DLIR-M and DLIR-H yielded better image quality scores than 5 mm ASIR-V reconstructed images. Mean qualitative scores of DLIR-H for noise (1.77 ± 0.71), contrast (1.6 ± 0.68), small structure visibility (1.42 ± 0.66), sharpness (1.34 ± 0.55), and image preference (1.11 ± 0.34) were the best (p<0.05). DLIR-M yielded intermediate scores. All DLIR reconstructions showed superior ratings for artifacts compared to ASIR-V (p<0.05), whereas each DLIR group performed comparably (p>0.05, 0.405-0.763). In the quantitative assessment, there were no significant differences in attenuation values between all reconstructions (p>0.05). However, DLIR-H demonstrated the lowest noise (9.17 ± 3.11) and the highest CNR (CNRliver = 26.88 ± 6.54 and CNRportal vein = 7.92 ± 3.85) (all p<0.001). Conclusion: DLIR allows generation of thin-section (1.25 mm) abdominal CT images, which provide improved image quality with higher inter-reader agreement compared to 5 mm thick images reconstructed with ASIR-V. Clinical Impact: Improved image quality of thin-section CT images reconstructed with DLIR has several benefits in clinical practice, such as improved diagnostic performance without radiation dose penalties.

However, the steroidogenic potential of the gonad is still unknown. In this study, H. rugulosus were obtained by stimulating fertilization in the laboratory under natural light and temperature conditions. The gonads were collected and their steroidogenic potential was evaluated by determining the expression level of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding for cytochrome P450 17-hydroxylase/C17–20 lyase (CYP17) and cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and the localization of CYP17 mRNA in tissues by in situ hybridization. The CYP17 mRNA levels in males at 4–11 weeks postmetamorphosis were higher than in female and intersex gonads. This corresponded to their localization in the gonadal tissues, where CYP17 signals were specifically detected in the Leydig cells of the testis at 5–16 weeks postmetamorphosis but was undetectable in all ovary samples. The CYP19 mRNA levels in females at 4–11 weeks postmetamorphosis was higher than in male and intersex gonads, which corresponded with gonadal development, indicating the potential steroidogenic function of the ovary. Based on the present results, the role of CYP17 and CYP19 mRNA in sex differentiation in H. rugulosus may occur after gonadal sex differentiation and the steroidogenic potential of the gonads exhibited a sexual dimorphic pattern. These results provide a crucial basis for further research on the developmental biology in anuran species."

The impedance examination was carried out under a voltage ranging from −1 V to 1 V. Each complex impedance arch unveiled only one arc with its center beneath the real axis. Elevated voltage facilitates a reduction in the semicircle size. Based on the simulated equivalent circuit model, the heterojunctions possessed high parallel resistance and a constant phase element (CPE) at the grain boundary, raising the V. The CPE for the grain, grain boundary, and junction implied behavior close to the ideal capacitor. The dielectric loss tangent results indicated that the heterojunctions exhibited leakage behavior. From the alternating-current conductivity plots, the plateau and dispersion areas were revealed at low and high frequencies, respectively. The direct-current conductivity was 9.49 × 10−3 S cm−1 at −1 V and elevated to 8.87 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 1 V, due to the augmented charge carriers. Jonscher's power law fitting exposed that the constructed heterojunction exhibited short-range hopping within the boundary of the neighborhood."

Changes in mechanical and thermal properties and morphology were observed, and structural and chemical degradation were analyzed. The addition of ENR improved the impact strength of the biocomposites before weathering, acting as an impact modifier. After the weathering test, the flexural properties of PLA-based biocomposite with ENR and silanized wood pulp fiber (ENR-modified WP) was better than the flexural properties of a biocomposite without ENR. The biodegradability of the biocomposites largely depended on the PLA matrix. The modified fibers have lower UV absorbance and can protect composites from UV light better than unmodified fibers. ENR and modified WP helped prevented the degradation of PLA. While weathering reduced the molecular weight of the WP and modified WP biocomposites by 78% and 61%, respectively, the molecular weight of the same biocomposites with ENR decreased by 51% and 50%, respectively. The accelerated weathering test produced cracks and increased surface roughness in the biocomposites and the glass transition temperature was reduced as a result of crystallization and chain shortening. These indicated that the biocomposite based containing ENR and silanized wood pulp fiber had better weathering resistance due to lowest absorption of UV radiation which was more suitable for applications in construction, furniture, and exterior and interior decoration."

In this work we report the fabrication of Lanthanum -doped indium sulfide thin films (In2S3:La) using a low-cost nebulizer spray pyrolysis method. La-doping concentration is varied from 0 to 5 wt% and the effect of doping on the properties of In2S3 thin films are investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), UV–Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra. Incorporation of 3 wt% of La3+ in In2S3 lattice has substantially improved the crystallinity, surface morphology and optical properties of the thin films suitable for the device fabrication. Moderate doping of La3+ in the crystal lattice of β-In2S3 led to a red-shift in the absorption edge, which benefited utilization of wider light spectrum. Photodetectors are fabricated using In2S3:La (0–5 wt%) films and photodetector performance parameters are evaluated using I-V characteristics and current–time characterization. The In2S3 film with 3% La dopant concentration showed high photodetector performance with estimated detectivity (D*), photoresponsivity (R), and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.11 × 1011 Jones, 5.05 × 10-1 AW−1, 118% respectively. For the same sample, the rise and fall time calculated from transient photo-response analysis is found to be 0.4 s and 0.3 s respectively. These optimally doped In2S3:La 3wt% thin film samples could be useful for the fabrication of photosensor based optoelectronic devices."

This study aimed to study the effects of anti-seizure medications (ASMs), adjusted with reported factors associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) on HRV parameters. Methods: We recruited patients who were admitted in our epilepsy monitoring unit between January 2013 and December 2021. Two 5-min electrocardiogram epochs during wakefulness and sleep were selected in each patient. HRV analysis with Python® software was performed. The imputed datasets were used for linear regression analysis to assess association between each ASM item and all HRV parameters. The effects of ASM on HRV parameters were subsequently adjusted with the significant clinical characteristics and the concomitant use of other ASMs, respectively. Results: Carbamazepine (CBZ), levetiracetam (LEV), lamotrigine (LTG), and clonazepam (CZP) were statistically significantly associated with changes of sleep HRV parameters. Only CBZ showed negative effects with reduction in HRV, evidenced as lower standard deviation of RR interval (SDNN), even when adjusted with concomitant use of other ASMs (p = 0.045) and had a trend of significance when adjusted with significant clinical characteristics of concurrent taking of beta-blocker drug (p = 0.052). LEV and CZP showed opposite effects with increased HRV even when adjusted with significant clinical characteristics and the concomitant use of other ASMs. Conclusions: CBZ showed negative effects on HRV. We proposed that CBZ should be cautiously used in patients with known risks for SUDEP. In addition, HRV assessment should be performed prior to commencing CBZ and re-performed in follow-up in cases of prolonged use."

To explain a viable reaction mechanism for the 2760 ± 10 % μmol.gcat-1.hr-1 production rate achieved in a continuous reaction system, several theoretical models were developed. According to DFT simulation results, oxygen vacancy might be regarded as the main reaction site for CO2 to CO conversion. Moreover, a viable reaction pathway leading to CH4 formation is proposed.

Nitrite in G-EME is oxidized by oxygen to nitrate, leading to the negative error and the impossibility of simultaneous analysis. In this work, the application of oxygen scavengers to the acceptor phase of the G-EME system was attempted to minimize the oxidation effect. Several oxygen scavengers were selected and examined according to their compatibility with ion chromatography. The mixture of sulfite and bisulfite (14 mg L−1) showed the highest efficiency in preventing the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. Under the optimized conditions, a good linear range was obtained (10–200 μg L−1; R2 > 0.998) with a detection limit of 8 µg L−1 for both nitrite and nitrate. This method was applied to the simultaneous determination of nitrite and nitrate in sausage samples."

However, sluggish Na+ diffusion and low electronic conductivity of selenides still hinder their practical applications. Herein, FeSe2-xSx microspheres have been prepared via a self-doping solvothermal method using NH4Fe(SO4)2 as both the Fe and S source, followed by gas phase selenization. The density functional theory calculation results reveal that S doping not only improves the Na adsorption, but also lower the diffusion energy barrier of Na atoms at the S doping sites, at the same time enhance the electronic conductivity of FeSe2-xSx. The carbon-free nature of the FeSe2-xSx microspheres results in a low specific surface area and a high tap density, leading to an initial columbic efficiency of 85.6%. Compared with pure FeSe2, such FeSe2-xSx delivers a high reversible capacity of 373.6 mAh·g−1 at a high current density of 5 ​A·g−1 after 2000 cycles and an enhanced rate performance of 305.8 mAh·g−1 at even 50 ​A·g−1.

Therefore, the desorption process is one of the key important processes for the CO2 capture system. Traditionally, most of the literature studies focus on the desorption of solid sorbent under an N2 atmosphere. However, the desorption process of the solid sorbent is inappropriate in the real system because the system will need another process to separate CO2 and nitrogen (N2) after the desorption process. This study focused on the CO2 desorption of potassium carbonate supported on gamma-alumina (K2CO3/γ-Al2O3) in a wet fluidized bed under a steam atmosphere by using the multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The effects of water thickness and dry restitution coefficient on CO2 desorption rate were investigated to provide a realistic particle collision behavior and to explore their effects on CO2 desorption phenomena. Moreover, the effect of steam velocity on the hydrodynamic behaviors of fluidization which on CO2 desorption rate was studied. The simulated results demonstrated that all the parameters, water thickness, dry restitution coefficient, and steam velocity had significantly affected system hydrodynamics and CO2 desorption rate in the wet fluidization desorption process. Furthermore, the effect of desorption temperature on CO2 desorption rate was evaluated for finding the appropriate temperature for CO2 desorption process of K2CO3/γ-Al2O3. The results showed that the appropriate desorption temperature for CO2 desorption under steam atmosphere was the temperature over 150 °C."

HDPE was then blended with P811 at various ratios of 80/20, 90/10 and 95/5 percent by weight. The mechanical, chemical, morphological, and water contact angle properties were investigated in this study. The mechanical properties of HDPE/P811 blends tend to decrease with increasing P811 content up to 20 wt% due to incompatibility between HDPE and P881. However, HDPE/P811 shows good performance in tensile strength but other performance declines, such as an elongation at break and Young’s modulus including impact strength. Therefore, this study finds that the optimum ratio of HDPE/P811 blending is 90/10. The water contact angle measurement reveals the wetting property of the blends compared to neat polymer. The thermal properties of HDPE/P811 indicate that the melting temperature (Tm) shifts to a higher degree compared to neat HDPE, while the crystallinity percent of polymer blends tend to decrease with higher P881 content. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and infrared spectrum show well-dispersed particles and incompatibility in the chemical interactions between HDPE and P811, respectively."

This study describes the digestive tract and accessory organs of I. japonica, using morphological and histological methods. The fish (10 individual fish, 24.5 ± 0.98 cm in total length) were obtained from Libong Island, Thailand. Integrated morphological and histological data showed that the digestive tract was composed of oesophagus, stomach, pyloric caeca and intestine, with accessory organs. All digestive tracts consisted of four layers, including mucosa, submucosa, muscularis and serosa. Two stomach regions were identified (cardiac and pyloric stomachs). Several clusters of gastric glands were identified in the cardiac stomach. Each gland was a unicellular structure. The apical surface of this gland contained the vacuolar cell. The intestine was lined with a simple columnar structure with goblet cells that was similar to pyloric caecum. Goblet cells were rare in the anterior intestine, in contrast to the posterior intestine where goblet cells were abundant.

As the most-used anode material, zinc metal always encounters poor coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability, because of the serious zinc dendrite and harmful side reactions on Zn surface. Here, a solid-phase non-adhesive homogeneous Nano-Si layer has been embedded on the Zn surface (Zn-Si) via an ultra-facile grinding method. The Nano-Si layer can regulate an even electric field distribution to achieve a homogeneous zinc deposition, and it also can greatly lower the charge transfer resistance and nucleation energy barrier of Zn2+ to facilitate the zinc deposition, thus achieving a dendrites-free and long-life Zn anode. Encouragingly, the zinc symmetrical battery with Zn-Si anode delivers a superior CE of 99.6 % in 1000 cycles under 5 mA cm−2, and a stable cycle lifespan of 3600 h under 1 mA cm−2 with much lower polarization potential (42 mV), outperforming the symmetrical battery with pure Zn anode (455 h, 59 mV) and various previously reported strategies.

Methods: This prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized control trial divided participants 1:1:1:1 to receive a second dose of either standard (10-μg) or half-dose (5-μg) BNT162b2 vaccines as follows: CoronaVac/10-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 1), CoronaVac/5-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 2), 10-μg-BNT162b2/10-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 3), or 10-μg-BNT162b2/5-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 4). A subset of participants from each arm received 10-μg-BNT162b2 booster (third) doses 16 weeks after their second vaccination. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity were assessed and adverse events (AEs) digitally self-reported. Results: Of 553 enrolled participants, 50 % were male, the median (interquartile range) age was 8.65 (7.00, 10.00) years, and a majority (91 %) had normal weight-for-height. All participants exhibited similarly robust neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against the ancestral Wuhan strain two weeks after the second vaccination, with titers highest in Group 1 (737.60, 95% CI [654.80, 830.88]), followed by Groups 3 (630.42, 95% CI [555.50, 715.45]), 2 (593.98, 95% CI [506.02, 697.23]), and 4 (451.79, 95% CI [388.62, 525.23]), as well as 56.01 % and 49.68 % seroconversion for BA.1 and BA.5, respectively. Half-dose BNT162b2 as a second dose induced significantly lower NAb titers compared to their respective full-dose regimens (p = 0.03 for Groups 1 vs 2 and p < 0.001 for Groups 3 vs 4). 77.71 % of participants developed SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein-specific T-cell responses two weeks after the second vaccination.

It is accomplished through translational machinery, and a key step is the translocation of tRNA-mRNA by elongation factor G (EF-G). Genome-based analysis revealed two EF-G encoding genes (S0885 and S2082) in the freshwater cyanobacterium model Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. S0885 is the essential EF-G gene for photosynthesis. We generated a strain of S. elongatus PCC7942 that overexpressed S0885 (OX-S0885) to identify EF-G functionality. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed increased transcriptional and translational levels in OX-S0885 at 10.5–13.5 and 2.0–3.0 fold, respectively. Overexpression of S0885 led to an increase in specific growth rate. Additionally, polysome-to-monosome ratio (P/M) and RNA-to-protein ratio (R/P) were elevated in OX-S0885 compared with the empty vector. Interestingly, R/P in OX-S0885 was retained at more than 70% under oxidative stress while R/P in the empty vector was severely depleted, suggesting the maintenance of translation. Thus, S0885 appeared to be the important target of oxidative stress because it was protected by the stress response system to maintain its function. These results suggest that cyanobacterial EF-G has a primary function in translation and an unrelated activity during stress conditions. These findings support the substantial role of EF-G in the formation and maintenance of cellular protein formation, and in the protection of the global translational mechanism under oxidative stress condition."

This now submerged region is known as Sundaland and played a key role in the expansion of flora, fauna, and humans during the Quaternary. However, information regarding past environmental conditions is sparse as post-glacial sea-level rise submerged and eroded most sedimentary archives. In this study, a combination of geomorphological mapping, investigating sedimentary features, and optically stimulated luminescence dating is used to decipher the evolution of sand ridges found in the coastal zone of the Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, southern Thailand. The two main ridges (eastern and western) are composed of moderately to poorly sorted medium to coarse, structureless massive sands. The eastern ridge deposited between ca. 8.3 ka and 0.16 ka and formed by coastal processes related to sea-level change and storm surge during the Holocene. Surprisingly, the western ridge yields a minimum depositional age of ca. 82 ka, and further deposition dates to different periods of the Late Pleistocene. We suggest that the initial formation of the western ridge possibly occurred during the Last Interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 5e). During periods of low global sea level, when the region was far away from the coast, the ridge accumulated further sand, most likely due to aeolian activity. This would imply a rather limited vegetation cover in the interior of Sundaland and support previous assumptions of savannah-like conditions during global-scale glacial periods."

An accurate and rapid diagnostic method to distinguish between neutered and bilateral abdominal cryptorchid dogs is needed in veterinary practice. Therefore, this study uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to evaluate the clinical relevance of AMH analysis in peripheral blood as a diagnostic tool for dogs with suspected bilateral abdominal cryptorchidism. The possible alteration of the AMH localization in testicular tissue caused by this pathologic condition was also investigated using immunohistochemistry. Male dogs were divided into three groups of healthy intact (n = 14), healthy castrated (n = 14), and bilateral abdominal cryptorchid (n = 14) dogs. The results demonstrated a higher level of serum AMH in the cryptorchid group compared to the intact group (P < 0.01), while serum AMH levels of all castrated dogs were below the limit of detection (<0.05 ng/mL). Moreover, the percentage of positive AMH immunostaining of the intact group was less than that of the cryptorchid group (P < 0.01). A significantly positive correlation was found between serum AMH concentration and localization in testicular tissues (r = 0.93, P < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMH levels in the peripheral blood could be used as an alternative and rapid screening method for detecting dogs with abdominal cryptorchidism."

A total of 20 mix designs were utilized, with 10–30% volume replacement of fine aggregate with CR and addition of 0.1–0.4% GNPs by weight of binder. All mix designs were studied for attributes including slump flow, compressive strength, stress-strain behavior, modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, flexural strength, toughness, impact resistance, water absorption, and porosity. Morphological changes due to crack formation, microstructure, and interfacial interaction between aggregate and mortar were evaluated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Vickers microhardness tests were carried out from the surface of aggregate towards the matrix to evaluate the interfacial transition zone. Results indicated that CR replacement reduced the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete, while GNPs inclusion mitigated the negative effects of CR and significantly enhanced the properties of the geopolymer concrete. Results also revealed that 0.3% addition of GNPs increased the compressive strength, elastic modulus, tensile strength, and flexural toughness of the concrete containing the CR. Moreover, addition of 0.3% GNPs in specimens having 30% CR enhanced the average microhardness by 34%, which demonstrates that GNPs addition improved the matrix compactness and interfacial transition zone between CR and matrix. Multi-objective optimization with RSM was accomplished for the combined use of CR and GNPs in fly ash-based geopolymer concrete. RSM results showed that combination of 10% CR and 0.2% GNPs is the best combination for achieving the highest strength properties with the lowest percentage of GNPs."
['Aquatic Science'],"Sustainable practice for a zero-discharge outdoor earthen shrimp pond based on biological nitrogen waste carrying capacity  2023 Elsevier B.V.In this study, we proposed a sustainable practice for managing an environmentally friendly outdoor earthen ponds for shrimp biomass production based on biological nitrogen treatment processes. A 26-day bottom soil acclimation was operated under appropriate oxygen (> 5 mg/L) and alkalinity (100–150 mg-CaCO3) concentrations, followed by a 76-day Penaeus vannamei cultivation in small (0.04 ha; pond I) and large (0.16 ha; pond II) ponds without water exchange and the addition of probiotic bacteria. With the proper pond preparation, the nitrification process was promoted during the pond acclimation period, as demonstrated by the conversion pattern of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) oxidation to nitrite. During shrimp cultivation, the acclimated ponds were able to control TAN and nitrite concentrations below acceptable limits (< 0.2 mg-N/L) while the TAN build-up was reported when the feeding rate exceeded 220 kg-feed/ha/day, indicating the limitation of the nitrogen waste carrying capacity. Additionally, pond acclimation encouraged bacterial activities, especially assimilation and nitrification processes, with higher rate indices of TAN removal (0.048–0.069 g-N/m2/h) compared to photoautotrophic uptake (0.014–0.028 g-N/m2/h). The overall TAN carrying capacity was extrapolated to be 1.31–2.00 g-N/m2/day. Biological treatment processes all contributed to low dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) accumulation (4.8–6.0%) and high unidentified nitrogen loss (54.7–59.3%). The pond ecological balance also promoted phytoplankton growth at chlorophyll-a concentration of 122.34–169.66 mg/m3. Oxygen evolution index by photosynthesis (2.65–2.98 g-O2/m2/h) was sufficient for the consumption of both water (1.85–1.96 g-O2/m2/h) and bottom soil (0.09–0.12 g-O2/m2/h); however, mechanical aeration was necessary during a light absence period due to lower rate of extrapolated daily photosynthesis (31.81–35.81 g-O2/m2/day) compared to the respiration rate indices of water and bottom soil (45.88–47.57 g-O2/m2/day). High shrimp production of 7.9–9.2 t/ha/crop was achieved with the average daily gain (ADG) of 0.29–0.31 g/day and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1.13–1.28. These findings contributed to the strategic development of pond acclimation and the sustainability of outdoor earthen shrimp ponds in terms of both ecosystem balance and the profitability of high biomass production."

It reduces their service life. This study investigated the impact wear of alloy steel using computational techniques combined with empirical data. The ultimate objective was to develop an approach requiring low–moderate effort for industrial application using limited resources to predict the average impact wear rate of AISI 4140 alloy steel (one of the most commonly used materials). The wear mechanisms were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Indirect monitoring was used to examine the wear stage transition cycle, e.g., from mild to severe wear. The empirical results showed that the transition cycle depended on the impact force. Fatigue was identified as the key damage mechanism, with cracks and lamellar wear appearing under severe deterioration. The average wear rate from the initial impact cycle to the wear stage transition cycle increased as the impact force increased. A simplified computational 2D finite element model assuming a smooth frictionless surface was used to investigate the contact condition. The contact behavior including the stress–strain distribution that developed during first contact was investigated using finite element analysis. A combined empirical and computational approach to predicting average wear rate was developed based on stress distribution data from the FE model and fatigue properties. The prediction results were then validated by comparison with the empirical data. These showed good agreement. The stress amplitude derived from an equivalent high-stress region was also introduced. The predicted curve of average wear rate versus stress amplitude of an equivalent high-stress region improved the design of the component."

By using a one-step gamma irradiation, the amine-incorporated zinc complex/carbon dots composites were prepared from zinc acetate dihydrate, ethylenediamine, and carbon dots. The impacts of ethylenediamine and carbon dots on the performance of the supercapacitor were examined. The highest specific capacitance obtained in this work was 179.9 F g−1 along with an excellent 91 % capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. To clarify the mechanistic insights on the improved supercapacitor performance, an electrochemical analysis was performed, and it was found that amine incorporation improved the diffusion process of charge transfer, which led to better charge storage and higher capacitance. We have demonstrated that gamma irradiation is a simple and efficient method for creating electro-active materials based on amine-incorporated zinc complex/carbon dots composites for supercapacitors with improved performance and electrochemical properties."

To better understand the relationship between the HIV reservoir in CD4+ T cells and the magnitude and differentiation status of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, we investigated these cells from acute and chronic HIV-infected individuals after 2 years of ART. Although both the HIV reservoir and the CD8+ T cell responses declined significantly after 2 years of ART, sustained HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses correlated with a greater reduction of integrated HIV provirus. However, the magnitude of CD8+ T cells specific for HIV Gag, Pol, Nef, and Vif proteins positively associated with the active reservoir size during ART, measured as cell-associated RNA. Importantly, high HIV DNA levels strongly associate with maintenance of short-lived HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, regardless of ART initiation time. Our data suggest that the active reservoir maintains HIV-specific CD8+ T cell magnitude but prevents their differentiation into functional cells."

The data are extracted from 68.8 nb−1 of ultra-peripheral proton-lead (pPb) collisions at sNN=8.16TeV using the CMS detector. The high energy lead ions produce a flux of photons that can interact with the oncoming proton. This γp system provides a set of unique initial conditions with multiplicity lower than in photon-lead collisions but comparable to recent electron-positron and electron-proton data. The VnΔ coefficients are presented in ranges of event multiplicity and transverse momentum (pT) and are compared to corresponding hadronic minimum bias pPb results. For a given multiplicity range, the mean pT of charged particles is smaller in γp than in pPb collisions. For both the γp and pPb samples, V1Δ is negative, V2Δ is positive, and V3Δ consistent with 0. For each multiplicity and pT range, V2Δ is larger for γp events. The γp data are consistent with model predictions that have no collective effects."

The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS detector in 2016–2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1. The search is sensitive to resonances with masses between 1.3 and 6TeV, decaying to bosons that are highly Lorentz-boosted such that each of the bosons forms a single large-radius jet. Machine learning techniques are employed to identify such jets. No significant excess over the estimated standard model background is observed. A maximum local significance of 3.6 standard deviations, corresponding to a global significance of 2.3 standard deviations, is observed at masses of 2.1 and 2.9 TeV. In a heavy vector triplet model, spin-1 Z′ and W′ resonances with masses below 4.8TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level (CL). These limits are the most stringent to date. In a bulk graviton model, spin-2 gravitons and spin-0 radions with masses below 1.4 and 2.7TeV, respectively, are excluded at 95% CL. Production of heavy resonances through vector boson fusion is constrained with upper cross section limits at 95% CL as low as 0.1 fb."

As biomass is seasonal variation and diversity, the design of the gasifier should consider a variety of biomass feedstock. This study investigated a single-designed downdraft gasifier of different biomass pellets using computational fluid dynamics and optimized for producer gas quality and gasifier efficiencies. Three biomass pellets, i.e., wood, bagasse, and palm-oil empty fruit bunch (PEFB), were considered the primary qualitative variable in addition to the main process variables, i.e., air-inlet temperature and equivalence ratio (ER). Response surface methodology (RSM) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) were carried out for process and biomass optimization. Tar yield is considered a response for optimization along with carbon conversion (CCE) and cold gas efficiencies (CGE). The results showed that ER and biomass type are crucial. The range of ER for each biomass should be carefully selected. The maximum efficiencies of the gasifier can be achieved using PEFB pellets, whereas the minimum tar yield was attained using wood pellets. The CCE and CGE of 93.11% and 65.16%, respectively, and the tar yield of 12.36 mg Nm−3, were obtained at an optimum ER of 0.28 and air-inlet temperature of 1272.8 K using PEFB pellets."

Events that have no leptons (all-hadronic), one lepton, or two opposite-sign leptons (where lepton refers only to prompt electrons or prompt muons) are considered. This is the first tt¯tt¯ measurement that includes the all-hadronic final state. The observed significance of the tt¯tt¯ signal in these final states of 3.9 standard deviations (1.5 expected) provides evidence for tt¯tt¯ production, with a measured cross section of 36−11+12fb. Combined with earlier CMS results in other final states, the signal significance is 4.0 standard deviations (3.2 expected). The combination returns an observed cross section of 17±4(stat)±3(syst)fb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction."

No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.OBJECTIVE: We compared the performance of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) messenger RNA testing of physician- and self-collected specimens for detecting histological grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) among women who visited a colposcopy clinic in Thailand. METHODS: From January 2022 to April 2022, 500 women participated in this cross-sectional multicenter study; 494 had complete data and valid specimen results. The participants were women who attended any one of the 10 participating institutes' colposcopy clinics due to abnormal cytology, positive high-risk HPV testing, or for follow-up. Participants used a self-sampling Aptima Multitest Swab specimen collection kit to self-collect vaginal samples before physicians biopsied the cervix during the colposcopic examination. The self- and physician-collected specimens were tested for high-risk HPV messenger RNA using Aptima nucleic acid amplification assays. Cervical tissues were collected during colposcopic-directed biopsy from the most severe lesion or a random biopsy and endocervical curettage specimen if no lesion was detected. RESULTS: We detected high-risk HPV messenger RNA in 75.4% of self-collected specimens and 70.6% of physician-collected specimens. The prevalence of histological grade 2 or higher CIN from cervical histology was 25.1% (n=124). For self-collected specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of high-risk HPV messenger RNA for grade 2 or higher CIN were 87.0% (95% CI 79.7% to 92.4%; n=108) and 28.5% (95% CI 24.0% to 33.4%). For physician-collected specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of high-risk HPV messenger RNA for grade 2 or higher CIN were 90.2% (95% CI 83.6% to 94.9%; n=112) and 36.1% (95% CI 31.2% to 41.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Self-collected specimens for high-risk HPV messenger RNA testing demonstrated good sensitivity and negative predictive value for detecting grade 2 or higher CIN in Thai women attending the participating institutes' colposcopy clinics. Self-collected samples performed similarly to physician-collected ones."

The participant cohort included 65 glaucomatous and 58 non-glaucomatous eyes (13 suspected glaucoma and 45 normal). An ophthalmologist diagnosed glaucoma patients and all subjects were over 18 years old, passed a visual field test, and underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations. LC images were obtained using the DRI OCT Triton, while optic disc images were obtained from the enface image of the Cirrus HD-OCT 5000. Since LC images alone did not provide clear edge information, we used optic disc images as a reference for edge detection. To achieve this, we employed a fine-tuned model, specifically a pre-trained U-shaped Encoder-Decoder Network with Attention. This model was used to obtain a segmented mask, which was then aligned and utilized to locate the edge of the LC in the LC images. A blood vessel mask was created to remove blood vessels, as they can interfere with the accurate visualization and analysis of LC characteristics. This step allowed for the 3D reconstruction of the LC structure without the presence of blood vessels. Correlations between LC volume, pore volume, and pore volume to LC volume were calculated separately for glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous eyes. We divided the areas for considering the LC structure into three types: overall, quadrants, and 12-clock-hour sectors. Based on the experimental results, we found that the pore volume and pore-to-LC volume were different between glaucoma and normal across all areas considered. In conclusion, this research generated 3D images of the LC from OCT images using computer techniques, showcasing a microstructure that closely resembles the actual LC. Statistical methods were employed to calculate and analyze the differences observed between the two groups of samples."

Off-grid communities can particularly benefit from standalone, scaled renewable power plants. This study developed a comprehensive techno-economic framework, analyzed the objective metrics, and assessed the influence of economies of scale in solar PV power plants to electrify off-grid communities, taking Baluchistan, Pakistan, as a pilot case. Simulations and analyses were performed using the System Advisor Model (SAM). The results indicate a noteworthy reduction in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) with increased power generation capacity. It was observed that utilizing bi-facial modules with single-axis tracking leads to a more cost-effective LCOE compared to the relatively expensive dual-axis trackers. The main cost factors identified in the analysis were capital costs, installed balance of plant (BOP), mechanical, and electrical costs. Notably, the disparity between the highest and lowest LCOE values across the six different power generation pathways amounted to approximately 38.5%. The average LCOE was determined to be 2.14 USD/kWh for fixed-mounted plants, 1.79 USD/kWh for single-axis plants, and 1.74 USD/kWh for dual-axis plants across the examined power generation capacity range. The findings can serve as a valuable benchmark, specifically for regional key stakeholders, in making informed investment decisions, formulating effective policies, and devising appropriate strategies for off-grid electrification and the development of renewable energy value chains."
