Title_Abstract
"Flexible Printed Active Antenna for Digital Television Reception  2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE).This paper presents the development of a flexible printed active antenna for the digital television (DTV) reception in areas having poor signal or in high-rise buildings. The antenna structure is composed of a meander line printed on a polyimide film as a radiating element. It has a thickness of 0.3 mm, highly flexible, and very lightweight. The design and analysis of the radiating element are based on a full-wave method implemented by a commercial electromagnetic simulation software. The amplifier circuit consisting of a surface-mount transistor and passive components are integrated directly on the polyimide film, residing next to the feedline, to improve the antenna performance and minimize the whole antenna dimension. The impedance matching between the radiating element, the feed line, and the active circuit are considered. The measured results show that the return loss of more than approximately 10 dB, the maximum gain of about 18 dB, and the Omni-directional radiation pattern are achieved in the operating frequency band of 510-790 MHz. Due to its flexibility, low profile, lightweight, and additional gain, the proposed antenna could be useful for various specific applications."
"Parametric study of hydrogen production via sorption enhanced steam methane reforming in a circulating fluidized bed riser  2018 Elsevier LtdComputational fluid dynamics was applied for sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SESMR) operating in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser. The solid mixtures consisted of Ni-based catalyst and CaO sorbent. The aim of study was to design a proper pilot-scale CFB riser which produced hydrogen (H2) with both high purity and high flux. The design parameters and the reaction parameters were examined with 2k full factorial design. The significances of each parameter were analyzed by analysis of variance. Using the optimum result, the highest H2 purity reached 98.58% in dry basis accompanied with the highest H2 flux of 0.301 kg/m2 s. The hydrodynamics of this optimum case showed that SESMR was nearly completed since 5.0 m height because axial and radial distributions of solid were well developed without excessive segregation between catalyst and sorbent. Thus, the H2 purity and the H2 flux approached fully developed within the riser height."
"Superhydrophobic coating from fluoroalkylsilane modified natural rubber encapsulated SiO 2 composites for self-driven oil/water separation  2018 Elsevier B.V. A superhydrophobic/superoleophilic mesh was successfully prepared in a simple and environmentally friendly process by coating with fluoroalkylsilane-modified natural rubber-encapsulated silica latex (FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 ). TEM images confirmed the formation of a core-shell morphology, in which the rubber core was fully covered by a silica shell. This improved the thermal stability of the composites. Coating with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 enhanced both the hydrophobicity and surface roughness of the mesh. The depth profile of the XPS spectra revealed the presence of fluoroalkylsilane on the superhydrophobic mesh and Ar gas ion etching confirmed migration of the fluoroalkylsilane, SiO 2 and carbon to the mesh surface. SEM and AFM results quantified the surface roughness of the coated mesh. Meshes coated with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 exhibited superhydrophobic/superoleophilic properties. Surfaces coated with these encapsulated particles were successfully applied to oil/water separation. They exhibited a separation efficiency of up to 100% and were reusable across 30 cycles."
"Electrochemical impedance-based DNA sensor using pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acids for tuberculosis detection  2018 Elsevier B.V. A label-free electrochemical DNA sensor based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-immobilized on a paper-based analytical device (PAD) was developed. Unlike previous PNA-based electrochemical PAD (ePAD) sensors where the capture element was placed directly on the electrode, acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper allowing regeneration by simple PAD replacement. As an example application, a sensor probe was designed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) detection. The ePAD DNA sensor was used to determine a synthetic 15-base oligonucleotide of MTB by measuring the fractional change in the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The R ct of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3-/4- before and after hybridization with the target DNA could be clearly distinguished. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to verify the EIS results, and showed an increase in peak potential splitting in a similar stepwise manner for each immobilization step. Under optimal conditions, a linear calibration curve in the range of 2–200 nM and the limit of detection 1.24 nM were measured. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch and non-complementary DNA targets due to the conformationally constrained structure of the acpcPNA. Moreover, the ePAD DNA sensor platform was successfully applied to detect PCR-amplified MTB DNA extracted from clinical samples. The proposed paper-based electrochemical DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative device for low-cost, simple, label-free, sensitive and selective DNA sensor."
"Evaluation of outsourcing transportation contract using simulation and design of experimentOcena kontraktów outsourcingowych w transporcie z wykorzystaniem symulacji i projektu eksperymentu  2018, Czestochowa University of Technology. All rights reserved.This paper aims to develop an approach to identify optimal fleet size under uncertainty and to identify important factors affecting transportation performance. The methodologies used in this paper are two folded. The first methodology is to develop a simulation model that allows manager to evaluate the impact of having different number of trailers on delivery and cost in order to identify the optimal fleet size. The second methodology is to use a Design of experiment (DOE) together with the simulation model to identify important factors that affect transportation performances. The result shows that the company should hire 16 trailers, which will reduce the delivery delay from 14% to 0.02%. Furthermore, it is found that variation in demand has a strong impact on late delivery and cost. There is also an interaction between demand variation and transportation time variation."
"The phenotypic and mutational spectrum of Thai female patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency  2018 Elsevier B.V.Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked urea cycle disorder affecting both males and females. Hemizygous males commonly present with severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy during the neonatal period. Heterozygous females have great phenotypic variability. The majority of female patients can manifest later in life or have unrecognized symptoms, making the diagnosis of OTCD in females very challenging. Here we report on three unrelated Thai female cases with OTCD presenting with different manifestations including aggressive behavior, acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy. Whole exome sequencing successfully identified disease-causing mutations in all three cases including two novel ones: the c.209_210delAA (p.Lys70Argfs*17) and the c.850T>A (p.Tyr284Asn). This study affirms variable symptoms in female patients with OTCD and emphasizes the importance of early recognition and prompt management for favorable outcomes. In addition, identification of two novel causative variants expands the genotypic spectrum of OTC."
"Predicting judicial decisions of criminal cases from Thai supreme court using bi-directional gru with attention mechanism  2018 IEEE.Predicting court judgement has gained growing attention over the past years. Prior attempts used traditional prediction techniques based on Bag of words (BoW), where the order of words is discarded, resulting in low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a prediction model of criminal cases from Thai Supreme Court using End-To-End Deep Learning Neural Networks. Our model imitates a process of legal interpretation, whereby recurrent neural networks read the fact from an input case and compare them against relevant legal provisions with the attention mechanism. The model's output shows if a person is guilty of a crime according to the fact and laws. After the performance test, we find that our model could yield the higher F1 than traditional text classification techniques including Naive Bayes and SVM. In addition, we innovate the open dataset called 'Thai Supreme Court Cases (TSCC)' that was compiled from many decades of Thai Supreme Court criminal judgements. It features the text of fact expertly extracted from each judgement, textual provisions from Thai Criminal Code, and binary-format labels following the theoretical criminal law structure. This dataset is useful for achieving judgement predicting task together with emulating actual criminal case trial."
"PH Variation as a Simple and Selective Pathway for Obtaining Nanoparticle or Nanocapsule Polysaccharides  2018 American Chemical Society. The fabrication of polysaccharides to be nanoparticles or nanocapsules is quite specific due to various parameters and factors. The present work demonstrates a simple pathway to selectively prepare the ionic polysaccharide flakes to be nanoparticles or nanocapsules. The systematic studies on the model cases of cationic polysaccharide (i.e., chitosan) and anionic polysaccharide (i.e., alginate) confirm that pK a is the key point to tune the polysaccharides to be nanoparticles or nanocapsules. When the ionic polysaccharides were in an oil/water emulsion system, the pH close to pK a leads to the densely packed polysaccharide chains under the hydrogen bond networks, and as a result the cross-link occurs all through the chains to be nanoparticles. On the other hand, when pH was adjusted to the lower or higher than pK a depending on the types of ionic polysaccharide, the polysaccharide chains are under charge-charge repulsive force, resulting in the alignment of polysaccharide chains to be hollow nanospheres, and at that time the cross-link initiates the formation of nanocapsules. The present work, for the first time, clarifies that pH variation is the key to selectively prepare nanoparticles or nanocapsules, and this is important for delivery systems, coatings, sensors, and so forth."
"Effect of Zr addition on the microstructure and tribological property of the anodization of Ti-6Al-4V alloy  2018The oxide layers of regular nanotubes structure were obtained on the surface of Ti–Zr alloys (Ti-6Al-4V-χZr (χ = 0, 20, 30, 40, 51)) by anodization. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDX) were used to characterize the morphology and composition of the nanotubes oxidized layers. The tribological property of the oxidized layers was evaluated using ball-on-disc wear tester. Neat microstructures can be obtained on all samples. With the addition of zirconium to the Ti-6Al-4V, the anodic oxidation is relatively intense, and the wear resistance of Ti-6Al-4V can be enhanced."
"Applying Text Mining for Classifying Disease from Symptoms  2018 IEEE.Nowadays, misdiagnoses account for a significant portion of medical errors [1]. This is due to the fact that each physician's diagnosis is different depending on the physician's knowledge, skill, and experience. In several cases, physicians may ignore uncommon diseases. Also, after the diagnosis, the physician has to provide ICD-10-CM code. This is a difficult process for most (if not all) physicians. We propose a predictive model for classifying disease from symptoms by applying text mining technique. Our research technique allows physician to diagnose and to access an ICD-10-CM code directly from symptoms. Our models are based on several classifiers such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. Models from each classifier were compared using training time, predicting time, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), precision and accuracy. The result suggests that Neural Network gives the best TPR at 89.03%."
"Classification of advertisement text on Facebook using synthetic minority over-sampling technique  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Understanding in consumer behavior is an important task in the field of marketing. Dentsu's AISAS model is a model that has been proposed to describe consumer behavior. The model defines reaction when the consumer has seen advertising into five stages: attention, interest, search, action, and share. In this paper, advertisement text datasets from Facebook were labelled as the stages of AISAS model and learned to be classified by machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, like many other real-world data, our dataset had imbalanced class distribution. The classifier algorithms tend to predict mostly the majority class. To overcome this problem, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was adopted and also combined with chi-square based feature selection technique. Varieties of feature sizes based on various classifier algorithms were compared. In the appropriate feature size, SMOTE could improve the classification performance in terms of recall and F1 score."
"Detecting Radio AGN Signatures in Red Geysers  2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.A new class of quiescent galaxies harboring possible AGN-driven winds has been discovered using spatially resolved optical spectroscopy from the ongoing SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. These galaxies, termed ""red geysers,"" constitute 5%-10% of the local quiescent population and are characterized by narrow bisymmetric patterns in ionized gas emission features. Cheung et al. argued that these galaxies host large-scale AGN-driven winds that may play a role in suppressing star formation at late times. In this work, we test the hypothesis that AGN activity is ultimately responsible for the red geyser phenomenon. We compare the nuclear radio activity of the red geysers to a matched control sample with similar stellar mass, redshift, rest-frame NUV - r color, axis ratio, and presence of ionized gas. We have used the 1.4 GHz radio continuum data from the VLA FIRST survey to stack the radio flux from the red geyser and control samples. In addition to a three times higher FIRST detection rate, we find that red geysers have a 5σ higher level of average radio flux than control galaxies. After restricting to rest-frame NUV - r color >5 and checking mid-IR WISE photometry, we rule out star formation contamination and conclude that red geysers are associated with more active AGNs. Red geysers and a possibly related class with disturbed Hα emission account for 40% of all radio-detected red galaxies with log (M ∗/M o) < 11. Our results support a picture in which episodic AGN activity drives large-scale, relatively weak ionized winds that may provide a feedback mechanism for many early-type galaxies"
"Organic agriculture education in Thai Universities: National trends and student perceptions  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Since the 1950s Green Revolution ""conventional"" agrochemical-dependent farming has grown substantially in Thailand. Adverse impacts have been natural resources depletion, environmental pollution, deforestation, food contamination and public health concerns. Thai higher education institutions (HEIs) have contributed to problems, promoting agrochemical-dependent farming with limited attention to organic agriculture (OA). Our paper examines how Thai HEIs incorporate OA into curricula and extension services, and how students perceive the value and adequacy of OA courses and training. It reviews policy and syllabus documents among 49 HEIs. Our analysis suggests most universities still do not view OA as a priority. Second, we examine student and graduate perceptions to illustrate national challenges. A survey of senior undergraduate students and recent alumni in one HEI showed both groups believed they did not have sufficient lectures or courses in OA or adequate resources and training to pursue an OA-related career after graduation. Current students viewed inadequacies even greater. Our conclusions suggest Thai HEIs must do more to reform programs, improve OA curricula and better support graduates. More research is needed to gather detailed and refined information from university agriculture education program administrators and documents with more qualitative and quantitative data on students from other Thai Universities."

"Observation of Weakened V-V Dimers in the Monoclinic Metallic Phase of Strained VO2  2018 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.Emergent order at mesoscopic length scales in condensed matter can provide fundamental insight into the underlying competing interactions and their relationship with the order parameter. Using spectromicroscopy, we show that mesoscopic stripe order near the metal-insulator transition (MIT) of strained VO2 represents periodic modulations in both crystal symmetry and V - V dimerization. Above the MIT, we unexpectedly find the long-range order of V - V dimer strength and crystal symmetry become dissociated beyond ≈200 nm, whereas the conductivity transition proceeds homogeneously in a narrow temperature range."
"Heterostructured d-Ti 3 C 2 /TiO 2/ g-C 3 N 4 Nanocomposites with Enhanced Visible-Light Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Activity  2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The construction of a 2D–2D heterostructured composite is an efficient method to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen generation capability under visible light. In this work, simple heat treatment of a mixture of g-C 3 N 4 and delaminated Ti 3 C 2 was used to prepare a series of d-Ti 3 C 2 /TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposites. The d-Ti 3 C 2 not only acted as the support layer and resource to glue the anatase TiO 2 particles and g-C 3 N 4 layers together but also served as the fast electron transfer channel to improve the photogenerated charge carriers’ separation efficiency. By tuning the g-C 3 N 4 /d-Ti 3 C 2 mass ratio, heating temperature and soaking time, the d-Ti 3 C 2 /TiO 2 /g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite 4-1-350-1 achieved an excellent H 2 evolution rate of 1.62 mmol h −1 g −1 driven by a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter. The heterostructured composite photocatalyst was stable even after 3 cycles, representing excellent potential for the practical application in solar energy conversion."
"Performance comparison of different cavitation reactors for biodiesel production via transesterification of palm oil  2018 Elsevier LtdThis study compares performance of different cavitation reactors for biodiesel production from palm oil using homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction systems. In addition, the effect of reaction volume of each reactor type was also investigated. For the smallest reaction volume of 165 mL, homogenizer and 20 kHz ultrasonic reactors offered the highest fatty acid methyl ester yield for both sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide catalysts. When the reaction volume was increased from 165 to 500 and 1000 mL with constant power input (80 W), homogenizer reactor did not significantly alter the rate of fatty acid methyl ester formation, unlike the other reactors which showed the decrease in the reaction rate. The reactor performance was evaluated in term of yield efficiency which was based on the amount of fatty acid methyl ester production, power consumption and reaction time. The increase of the reaction volume increased the yield efficiency of both the cavitation reactors and the mechanical stirred reactor. The highest yield efficiencies of 169.46 × 10−4 and 8.27 × 10−4 g/J were obtained from homogenizer reactor using sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide catalysts, respectively, using the reaction volume of 1000 mL. The homogenizer reactor also shows high flexibility of reaction volume usage with high biodiesel production performance in a batch system."
"The dynamic linkage among the size, growth and profitability of listed companies in the ASEAN-4 countries  2018 Contemporary Management Research.All rights reserved.The purpose of this paper is to examine the dynamic relationship among the size, growth, and profitability of listed companies. The study sample comprised listed companies in the ASEAN-4 countries-Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand-over the period 1972-2014. The K-medoids algorithm was employed in a cluster analysis, and the generalized method of moments (GMM) was applied to examine the dynamic relationship. The empirical results reveal that smaller companies tend to have higher growth than larger companies. Moreover, the results indicate that persistence of growth and persistence of profitability do not exist. There is also evidence that profitability affects companies' growth, but companies' growth does not affect profitability."
"Different natures of sub-gap states in 135-CIGS/112-CIGS and 112-CIGS/135-CIGS heterostructures investigated by photoluminescence technique  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. CuIn 1-x Ga x Se 2 (112-CIGS) has been proposed as a material for high efficiency thin film solar cells with reliably applicable photovoltaic properties. Higher efficiency devices can be achieved by various surface treatments and are believed to have Cu deficiency at the surface. One of the possible techniques is to have a very thin Cu-depleted surface, e.g. Cu(In 1-x Ga x ) 3 Se 5 (135-CIGS) layer on top of 112-CIGS layer, thus the heterostructure of 135-CIGS/112-CIGS is formed. Our previous work show that the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of 135-CIGS with various thicknesses on 112-CIGS (135-CIGS/112-CIGS) heterostructure are identified as donor-to-acceptor pairs (DAPs) and free (conduction band) -to-bound (acceptor) transitions and show the temperature and excitation power dependence on the PL spectra. On the contrary, when the thin 112-CIGS layer is deposited on top of 135-CIGS (112-CIGS/135-CIGS), the PL spectra show more pronounced and resolved peaks which are surprisingly independent of temperature and excitation power and significantly distinguishable in its natures observed in those broad emissions of 135-CIGS/112-CIGS heterostructures. When the thickness of 112-CIGS on 135-CIGS is increased, the red shift in the order of ten meV is noticed in the emission lines from both 112-CIGS and 135-CIGS layers. These results suggest that the strains play more important roles in thinner capping layer and freeze out the temperature and excitation power dependence in the 112-CIGS/135-CIGS rather than the 135-CIGS/112-CIGS heterostructures."
"Optical properties of CsI:Tl crystals grown using different precursors purities  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.CsI doped with Tl (CsI:Tl) is a scintillator material used for radiation detector applications. CsI:Tl was crystalized by a modified homemade Bridgman-Stockbarger technique using different precursor purities. The purpose is to verify effects of precursor purity on optical properties of Cs:Tl crystals by UV-VIS and X-ray luminescence spectroscopy. A type and concentration of impurities in the precursor are directly related the optical properties of CsI:Tl crystals. The CsI:Tl crystals were grown in two levels of CsI and TlI reactant materials, i.e., having as a very high purity of 99.999%, showing a colorless crystal and a high purity of 99.9% showing an orange crystal. Absorption coefficient determined by transmittance and reflectance spectra was used to find an optical gap in the CsI:Tl crystals. For the colorless crystal, optical gaps of the Tl-related state and the CsI bandgap were observed at 3.82 eV and 5.14 eV, respectively. On the other hand, a merging of the Tl-related state and the CsI bandgap was observed for the orange crystal to form a virtual single bandgap at 3.51 eV. These results indicated the effects of precursor purity on optical gap of the CsI:Tl crystals. Also, X-ray luminescence spectra centred at 2.07 - 2.25 eV, which are corresponding to that of the absorption edge, showed a red shift of 160 meV for the orange CsI:Tl crystal."
"CIGS thin film solar cells with graded-band gap fabricated by CIS/CGS bilayer and CGS/CIS/CGS trilayer systems  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. High efficiency CuIn 1-x Ga x Se 2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells are usually deposited on Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates by the three-stage co-evaporation process which is intended to create double-graded band gap. It requires short total deposition time and rapid changing of substrate temperature in order to obtain the double-graded band gap which is quite difficult for high source-temperatures. When the total deposition time cannot be made short enough, uniform band gap is rather achieved. In this work, the depositions of CIS/CGS bilayer are employed in order to create back grading while CGS/CIS/CGS trilayers are for the double-grading, owing to non-uniformity and different diffusivity of In and Ga constituents in the films. The bilayers with back grading show the increasing short-circuit current density (J sc ) due to the assisting back surface field, but the open-circuit voltage (V oc ) is relatively low due to the reduction of Ga content at the front surface. For the CGS/CIS/CGS trilayers, double grading and the increasing of V oc are observed when compared with the bilayers due to the increasing Ga content near the junction. The efficiencies of the devices fabricated from the CIS/CGS bilayer and CGS/CIS/CGS trilayer absorbers show the maximum value of 12.5% and 15.5%, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the bilayer and trilayer absorbers exhibit the enhancement in the long wavelengths compared to that of the three-stage process absorbers."
"Machine Learning system mimicking student's choice in Particle Data Analysis laboratory activity  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In Particle Data Analysis laboratory activity, aimed at undergraduate and high school students, the student is tasked with classifying collision events which contain two muons decaying from J/ψ meson. The activity provides 2000 collision events from the CMS detector, selected by CMS outreach community. However, classifying 2000 collision events by hand can be a tedious task for any human, so a smaller subset of collision events are usually used in the activity to save time. We built a machine learning classifier which mimic the student's classification based on a subset of collision events handed to the student, using some information from data in corresponding collision event. The information used in this system is parts of muon trajectory, extracted from files suited for CMS event viewer on the internet, as well as the four-momentum of both muons, available from the same source. With this system, students can input a subset of graded events into the system, and the system will be able to illustrate the results if the student worked on all 2000 collision events using his/her logic. Users can download the code from our repository and follow easy instructions to replicate this activity."
"Effects of global and local rewiring on SIS epidemic adaptive networks  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Adaptive epidemic network is generally driven by two main processes: (1) infection-recovery process that changes the states of the nodes, and (2) rewiring process that modifies the topology of the network. We consider an adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic on a network. In this work, a link is rewired randomly to a chosen susceptible node according to a prescribed global or local rewiring method. In the global rewiring case, a susceptible node could break the link with its infected neighbour to form a new link with another susceptible in the network. In this rewiring mechanism, the node must know health status of every other node in the network in order to rewire. This is however impractical in real life because the knowledge is only limited to a certain neighbouring group of nodes surrounding a given point. We propose a more realistic rewiring method called the local rewiring method, where a new link is limited to join a susceptible within a neighbouring distance. We investigate the impact of local versus global rewiring on an epidemic network. A new disease prevention behaviour emerges as a result."
"Glucose sensing characterization of non-enzymatic nickel film and nickel foam electrodes in sodium hydroxide solution  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. Recently, a non-enzymatic glucose sensor has gained a lot attention, because it is re-useable, fast and simple, as opposed to traditional enzymatic glucose sensor. In this work, two types of electrodes, including electroplated Ni film and Ni foam, were used as sensing electrodes for a non-enzymatic glucose sensor. The studied sensing properties of the Ni film and Ni foam included glucose-detecting sensitivity, selectivity, and detection limit. For the sensitivity and selectivity analysis, the sensing electrodes, with geometrical working area of 1 and 2 cm 2 for Ni foam and Ni film respectively, were submerged in a 1M NaOH solution, connected as a working electrode with Ag/AgCl and Pt as a reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Amperometric scanning measurement was used for the sensitivity and selectivity analysis. Sensitivity measurement was tested by dropping glucose solutions into 1M NaOH solution and recording the amperometric response of these sensor under varying sugar contents. The glucose-detection sensitivities are 1.1048 and 6.4228 mA mM -1 cm -2 for Ni plate and Ni foam, respectively. Limit of detection (LOD) of Ni film and Ni foam are 0.0072 and 0.0144 mM, respectively. The selectivity of electrodes were tested by dropping 3 types of disturbing agents: Quinine, Acetic acid and NaCl. The disturbing agents showed no effect on the current density signal during the amperometric measurement for both of the Ni plate and Ni foam electrodes."
"Shielding the Earth Magnetic Field using Spherical Coils  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a neutrino experiment consisting of 2 systems; central detector (CD) and veto systems. The CD is composed of thousands of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) used to detect light signals from neutrino induced interactions with liquid scintillator inside the CD. Another set of PMTs is used as water Cherenkov detector, together with muon top tracker forming the veto system for background rejection [1]. However, the PMTs' efficiency decreases when they are used in magnetic field. At JUNO's construction site, the Earth Magnetic Field (EMF) is approximately 0.45 G [2]. Therefore, the PMTs of JUNO detector are necessary to be shielded from the EMF. This work aims to design current-carrying coils that generate magnetic field in the opposite direction to the EMF, thus, the two fields tend to cancel each other. We found that the magnetic field generated by the 32 circular coils forming a sphere of diameter 43.5 m can reduce the residual magnetic field to be lower than 10% of the EMF at the CD region and less than 20% at the veto region. Moreover, considering the secular change of the EMF's inclination angle of approximately 2.87° over the 20 years of its operation, the coils can maintain the residual magnetic field both in the CD and the veto regions to be less than 10% and 20%, respectively."
"EMF Shielding of One Set of Circular Coils with Slight Distortion  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Jiangmen Undergroud Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a reactor antineutrino experiment with the main purpose for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy by precisely measuring the energy spectrum of nuclear reactor electron antineutrinos. The JUNO central detector consists of 20 kilotons an organic liquid scintillator filling the spherical CD or acrylic sphere whose diameter is 35.4 meters, surrounded by a water pool, approximately 18, 000 20″ and 25, 000 3″ photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) on the inner CD truss and 2,400 20″ Veto-PMT on the outer CD truss. The PMTs are very sensitive to external magnetic fields, the earth magnetic field (EMF) passing through the PMTs without any shielding would largely reduce the efficiency of the PMTs. In order to minimize the effect of EMF inside the detector, JUNO has been planing to use the DC coils to shield EMF, aiming at the residual EMF to less than 10 % on PMT areas."
"Evaluation of Thai students and teacher's attitudes in physics using Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS)  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey, CLASS, has been used as a tool to measure respondents' beliefs or attitudes about physics and how they learn physics. It is composed of 42 Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) type questions which is classified into 8 categories, which are real world connections, conceptual connections, personal interest, sense making, applied conceptual understanding, problem solving general, problem solving confidence and problem solving sophistication. In this study, we asked 196 high school physics teachers and 211 students from 195 secondary schools in Thailand to respond to this survey along with a 6-open-ended-question survey. In this paper, we focus on two topics: ""What is the difficulty in learning/teaching physics?"" and ""What is the goal in learning/teaching physics?"" We found that physics teachers agree with the experts in most categories, except conceptual connections, applied conceptual understanding and problem solving sophistication. While students tend to disagree with the experts in both conceptual categories and all 3 categories in problem solving. We then compare teachers' to students' responses from these two open-ended questions. On the difficulty aspect: 19% of students believe that difficulty in learning physics is due to incomprehension of physics concept. While 43% of teachers thought that difficulty in teaching physics is because of insufficiency of mathematics background. On the goals aspect, 37% of students aim to enter the university; while 50% of teachers target on helping student to better understand physics."
"Cosmic-Ray Muons Detection by a Spark Chamber  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. Cosmic ray, originating from several galactic sources, bombards the Earth's atmosphere and produces lots of secondary particles. One of them is an unstable charged particle known as ""muon"" (μ ± ) with speed close to speed of light and lifetime about 2.2 microseconds before decaying into others. In this study, a spark chamber detector with a stack of 10 parallel electrode plates is constructed to detect the cosmic-ray muons which will lose their energies via ionization in the helium filled chamber. When muons passing through the chamber, they left their traces as the ionization paths. Sparks will occur immediately between each stack of parallel electrodes which are connected to a high voltage supply. The muon's trajectory can then be visualized by connecting the sparks in each stack. To construct this muon's path, two cameras are set to record the events from the two perpendicular planes on two sides of the chamber. The photos are analyzed using MATLAB to obtain the coordinates of the sparking tracks which then are used to determine the zenith angular distribution. The results show that a large number of muons arrived at our laboratory (Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand 13° 44'09.5""N 100°31'49.6""E) with zenith angle about 30°"
"3D Information Retrieving of Concealing Surface beneath Opaque Resin Layer by Fast-Fourier Low Coherence Interferometer  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.A normalized contrast method on a Superluminescent diode (SLD) low coherence interferometer could retrieve 2D image concealing under a light-scattering medium. In addition, a continuous wavelet transform on both white light and SLD vertical scanning interferometry could construct 3D profile of the interfaces in a dual-layer structure. In this research, 3D information on surface, concealing beneath opaque resin layer, will be produced by using SLD phase difference interferometry with a Fast Fourier Transform. The effect of opaqueness of coating resin layer to quality of 3D image from our method will be revealed."
"Mass-radius bounds in massive gravity models  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The mass-radius ratio bounds of spherically symmetric static compact objects are considered in the ghost-free dRGT massive gravity. In this type of modified gravity model, the graviton has a non-zero mass leading to the naturally generated cosmological constant term. Therefore, this may bring about to an explanation for the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe without assuming any additional dark energy. The hydrostatic equilibrium (TOV) equation in this theory is derived to describe the structure of a spherical object such as a star. In this work, the generalized Buchdahl inequalities, providing the upper and lower limits of mass-radius ratio for high density compact objects, are obtained together with their crucial constraints. Finally, for theoretical testing these results may be proved in the context of astrophysical observations."
"Identification of Pinocembrin as an Anti-Glycation Agent and α-Glucosidase Inhibitor from Fingerroot (Boesenbergia rotunda): The tentative structure–activity relationship towards Mg-trapping activity  2018 by the authors.Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease that is caused by a malfunction of carbohydrate metabolism, which plays an important role in the development of long-term diabetic complications. The excess glucose can be transformed to methylglyoxal (MG), a potential precursor of glycation. Glycation is a spontaneous non-enzymatic reaction that initially yields advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which ultimately triggers several severe complications. Therefore, the inhibition of AGEs formation is the imperative approach for alleviating diabetic complications. The aim of this research was to investigate the glycation and α-glucosidase inhibitory abilities of compounds isolated from fingerroot. The dichloromethane extract afforded three flavanones, two chalcones, two dihydrochalcones, and one kavalactone. Most of the isolated compounds showed higher inhibition effect against AGEs formation than aminoguanidine (AG). Subsequent evaluation in MG-trapping assay indicated that their trapping potency was relatively comparable to AG. Their structure-activity relationships (SAR) of MG-trapping activity were investigated using the comparison of the structures of flavonoids. In addition, pinocembrin displayed moderate α-glucosidase inhibition against both maltase and sucrose, with IC50 values of 0.35 ± 0.021 and 0.39 ± 0.020 mM, respectively."
"Graceful exit for the cosmological constant damping scenario  2018 American Physical Society.We present a broad and simple class of scalar-tensor scenarios that successfully realize dynamical damping of the effective cosmological constant, therefore providing a viable dynamical solution to the fine-tuning or ""old"" cosmological constant problem. In contrast to early versions of this approach, pioneered in the works of A. Dolgov in the 1980s, these do not suffer from unacceptable variations of Newton's constant, as one aims at a small but strictly positive (rather than zero) late-time curvature. In our approach, the original fine-tuning issue is traded for a hierarchy of couplings, and we further suggest a way to naturally generate this hierarchy based on fermion condensation and softly broken field shift symmetry."
"Structural and transport phenomena of urocanate-based proton carrier in sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) membrane composite  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Proton transport is one of crucial phenomena in electrolytic part highly considered to overcome a limit in fuel cell efficiency improvement. Proton conducting organic electrolyte was modeled and simulated at atomistic level of calculation by doping of butyl urocanate (C4U), a composite material with imidazole substructure, with sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) amorphous membrane at various working temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate structural and dynamics characteristic of C4U in the membrane comparing with the SPEEK-hydronium membrane model as a control. From simulations, thermal effect on water and proton carriers cluster surrounding the sulfonate groups was explored. At higher temperature, the more transport dynamics of C4U ions in SPEEK membranes were found than that of hydronium ions in the control system. Likewise, phase separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts was taken into consideration here. A critical role of the enhancing proton conductivity by increasing the diffusion coefficient at temperature beyond C4U melting point in composite polymer membrane was emphasized.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Simulation of control characteristics of liquid column vibration absorber using a quasi-elliptic flow path estimation method  2018 Elsevier LtdTuned liquid column dampers (TLCDs) and liquid column vibration absorbers (LCVAs) are good substitutes for mechanical dampers to counter seismic activity exerted to tall buildings. The existing simplified effective length method could predict good results corresponding to test outcomes on TLCDs and LCVAs with small transition zones, but is found to yield larger discrepancy as larger transition zones are needed, often due to limited space constraints. The numerical panel method could be effectively employed to give more accurate results, but is not simple to formulate and needs to be re-modified for each new configuration. This paper proposes a new quasi-elliptic flow path estimation method to simulate control characteristics of TLCDs and LCVAs with relatively large transition boundary between the vertical columns and the horizontal cross-over duct, since liquid velocity's variation inside the large transition boundary cannot be assumed to occur at a single point. The simulation results are compared with experimental investigations conducted on a shake table, yielding satisfactorily better outcomes for large transition zones, as well as for small transition zones. This new formulation has been verified with a few other studies and has been found to be an excellent viable option with a respectable better, or at least comparable, accuracy level."

"Bacillus sp. strain M10 as a potential biocontrol agent protecting chili pepper and tomato fruits from anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum capsici  2018, International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).Bacillus sp. strain M10 was observed to produce an antifungal protein that inhibits the growth of Colletotrichum capsici, which is the causal agent of anthracnose disease of chili pepper and tomato. Ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the protein was approximately 55.4 kDa. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis and a subsequent sequence database search indicated the antifungal protein was most similar to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens vegetative catalase (KatA) protein. Light microscopy observation revealed that the antifungal protein induced abnormal hyphal elongation and conidial swelling and rupture. The protein considerably inhibited anthracnose development and protected the fruits from C. capsici infection. Thus, Bacillus sp. strain M10 and/or its putative catalase may be useful as a post-harvest biocontrol agent that protects chili pepper and tomato fruits from anthracnose disease caused by C. capsici."
"Finding impact factors for rejection of pull requests on GitHub  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.A pull request is an important method for code contributions in GitHub that will be submitted when the developers would like to merge their code changes from their local machine to the main repository on which all source code in the project are stored. Before merging the code changes into the main repository, the developers have to request for a permission. If their source code is allowed to merge, the pull request status is accepted. On the other hand, if their source code is not allowed to merge, the pull request status is rejected. The pull request status may be rejected due to several factors, such as code complexity, code quality, the number of changed files, etc. Fixing the rejected pull requests will take some extra effort and time which may affect the project cost and timeline. This paper aims at finding the impact factors that are associated with the rejection of pull requests on GitHub and also discovering the relationships among impact factors by using the association rules in data mining."
"Performance analysis of machine learning techniques in intrusion detection  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.This paper presents the performance analysis of machine learning techniques in intrusion detection. We analyze time to build (and to retrain) the models used by Intrusion Detection System. Machine Learning is a branch of computer science that allows computer to learn by themselves without programming sequence. These techniques can be applied to detect new threat that has never seen before. Due to the large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviors, optimizing the accuracy of IDS becomes an important open problem that is receiving attentions from the research community. However, the performance (time and space required) is usually ignored. Our study allows administrators work to make better decisions about how to select the proper hardware for intrusion detection in various environments. We proposed the models for estimating the time to build each model and the vector equation of the cut-off point is provided for determining the minimum number of CPU required for building Decision tree model and support vector machine model."

Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI. Funded by SCOAP3.Measurements of fragmentation functions for jets associated with an isolated photon are presented for the first time in pp and Pb-Pb collisions. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. Fragmentation functions are obtained for jets with pTjet>30 GeV/c in events containing an isolated photon with pTγ>60 GeV/c, using charged tracks with transverse momentum pTtrk>1 GeV/c in a cone around the jet axis. The association with an isolated photon constrains the initial pT and azimuthal angle of the parton whose shower produced the jet. For central Pb-Pb collisions, modifications of the jet fragmentation functions are observed when compared to those measured in pp collisions, while no significant differences are found in the 50% most peripheral collisions. Jets in central Pb-Pb events show an excess (depletion) of low (high) pT particles, with a transition around 3 GeV/c. This measurement shows for the first time the in-medium shower modifications of partons (quark dominated) with well-defined initial kinematics. It constitutes a new well-controlled reference for testing theoretical models of the parton passage through the quark-gluon plasma."
The ideal commensurate value of Sc and the superconducting phase under high pressure  2018 Author(s).The host-guest structure of scandium is described as being built of two penetrating substructures with the incommensurate periods of the channels along the c axis. We present the ideal commensurate value of 4/3 in Sc-II using ab initio calculations. We reveal that the 3c H and 4c G structures do interpenetrate and combine to the commensurate value of 4/3 of Sc-II at a pressure of 70 GPa. Ab initio molecular dynamics confirms the stability of the commensurate value 4/3 of the host-guest structure at 300 K and 72 GPa. The pressure-induced structural phase transitions in scandium under high pressure up to 200 GPa are investigated. We use ab initio random structure searching to predict the crystal structure of Sc-III: it is the tetragonal structure with space group P 4 1 2 1 2. Our calculations show that superconductivity arises in the P4 1 2 1 2 structure. This high pressure structure is not only a superconducting phase but also has been reported for the first time in this group of elements.
"A mini review on antidiabetic properties of fermented foods  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In general, fermented foods (FFs) are considered as functional foods. Since the awareness about the health benefits of FFs has increased, the consumption of FF also improved significantly in recent decades. Diabetes is one of the leading threats of the health span of an individual. The present manuscript details the general methods of the production of FFs, and the results of various studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies) on the antidiabetic properties of FFs. The fermentation method and the active microbes involved in the process play a crucial role in the functional properties of FFs. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have been reported on the health-promoting properties of FFs, such as anti-inflammation, anticancer, antioxidant properties, improved cognitive function and gastrointestinal health, and the reduced presence of metabolic disorders. The studies on the functional properties of FFs by randomized controlled clinical trials using human volunteers are very limited for several reasons, including ethical reasons, safety concerns, approval from the government, etc. Several scientific teams are working on the development of complementary and alternative medicines to improve the treatment strategies for hyperglycemia."
"Search for Leptoquarks Coupled to Third-Generation Quarks in Proton-Proton Collisions at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN.for the CMS Collaboration. Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the »https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/» Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI. Funded by SCOAP3.Three of the most significant measured deviations from standard model predictions, the enhanced decay rate for B→D(∗)τν, hints of lepton universality violation in B→K(∗) decays, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, can be explained by the existence of leptoquarks (LQs) with large couplings to third-generation quarks and masses at the TeV scale. The existence of these states can be probed at the LHC in high energy proton-proton collisions. A novel search is presented for pair production of LQs coupled to a top quark and a muon using data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1, recorded by the CMS experiment. No deviation from the standard model prediction has been observed and scalar LQs decaying exclusively into tμ are excluded up to masses of 1420 GeV. The results of this search are combined with those from previous searches for LQ decays into tτ and bν, which excluded scalar LQs below masses of 900 and 1080 GeV. Vector LQs are excluded up to masses of 1190 GeV for all possible combinations of branching fractions to tμ, tτ and bν. With this analysis, all relevant couplings of LQs with an electric charge of -1/3 to third-generation quarks are probed for the first time."
"WS2 and C-TiO2 Nanorods Acting as Effective Charge Separators on g-C3N4 to Boost Visible-Light Activated Hydrogen Production from Seawater  2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSemiconductor photocatalysis is regarded as an ideal method for use in solving the energy shortage and environmental issues by converting solar energy to chemical energy. Herein, we have designed a facile synthetic methodology to obtain a ternary co-modified g-C3N4 composite via WS2 and carbon-doped TiO2 (C-TiO2) nanorods with highly efficient photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from deionized (DI) water and a natural seawater system under visible-light illumination. This composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine g-C3N4, WS2, C-TiO2 nanorods, and the reference-modified g-C3N4 composite with individual WS2 or C-TiO2 nanorods. Co-modified g-C3N4 composite shows a great photostability in both DI water and seawater. Under λ=420 nm monochromatic light illumination, the apparent quantum efficiency of the co-modified g-C3N4 composite in seawater solution is 13.08 %, which is higher than pure g-C3N4 (5.06 %). WS2, TiO2, and g-C3N4 constitute a ternary heterojunction boosting the fast separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, which plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the WS2 and C-TiO2 nanorod co-modified g-C3N4 composite with high photocatalytic performance provides a promising candidate for rationally utilizing the seawater resource to produce clean chemical energy."
"Physics-based motion capture imitation with deep reinforcement learning  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.We introduce a deep reinforcement learning method that learns to control articulated humanoid bodies to imitate given target motions closely when simulated in a physics simulator. The target motion, which may not have been seen by the agent and can be noisy, is supplied at runtime. Our method can recover balance from moderate external disturbances and keep imitating the target motion. When subjected to large disturbances that cause the humanoid to fall down, our method can control the character to get up and recover to track the motion. Our method is trained to imitate the mocap clips from the CMU motion capture database and a number of other publicly available databases. We use a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn to dynamically control the gain of PD controllers, whose target angles are derived from the mocap clip and to apply corrective torques with the goal of imitating the provided motion clip as closely as possible. Both the simulation and the learning algorithms are parallelized and run on the GPU. We demonstrate that the proposed method can control the character to imitate a wide variety of motions such as running, walking, dancing, jumping, kicking, punching, standing up, and so on."
"Design of output feedback nonlinear model predictive control for inverted pendulum on cART  ICROS.This paper presents designing of output feedback nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for nonlinear systems. NMPC employs the state feedback and updates the control input at each sampling step. The control design of NMPC is formulated as optimal control which requires the information of states of the process. However, in practice, we can measure only some states of the process. This paper aims to use the state observer to estimate the unknown states and use them as feedback for NMPC. We apply output feedback NMPC to inverted pendulum on cart. Numerical results show the response of output feedback NMPC asymptotically converges to that of state feedback NMPC."

"Two Properties of Pseudo-Polynomials over a Galois Field  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Let F be the completion, with respect to the degree valuation, of the field of rational functions over , the Galois (finite) field of q elements. A function f : F → F is integer-valued if . An integer-valued function f is called a pseudo-polynomial if f(M+K)≡f(M)(modK) for all and . Based on an interpolation series introduced by Carlitzin 1935, explicit shapes of pseudo-polynomials are established. Using an asymptotic characterization of polynomials, it is also proved that the set of all pseudo-polynomials is an integral domain but not a unique factorization domain."
"Basic fibroblast growth factor regulates phosphate/pyrophosphate regulatory genes in stem cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth  2018 The Author(s). Background: Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) regulates maintenance of stemness and modulation of osteo/odontogenic differentiation and mineralization in stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs). Mineralization in the bones and teeth is in part controlled by pericellular levels of inorganic phosphate (P i ), a component of hydroxyapatite, and inorganic pyrophosphate (PP i ), an inhibitor of mineralization. The progressive ankylosis protein (gene ANKH; protein ANKH) and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1/ENPP1) increase PP i and inhibit mineralization, while tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALPL; TNAP) is a critical pro-mineralization enzyme that hydrolyzes PP i . We hypothesized that regulation by bFGF of mineralization in SHEDs occurs by modulation of P i /PP i -associated genes. Methods: Cells were isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth and characterized for mesenchymal stem cell characteristics. Cells were treated with bFGF, and the osteogenic differentiation ability was determined. The mRNA expression was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The mineralization was examined using alizarin red S staining. Results: Cells isolated from primary teeth expressed mesenchymal stem cell markers, CD44, CD90, and CD105, and were able to differentiate into osteo/odontogenic and adipogenic lineages. Addition of 10 ng/ml bFGF to SHEDs during in vitro osteo/odontogenic differentiation decreased ALPL mRNA expression and ALP enzyme activity, increased ANKH mRNA, and decreased both P i /PP i ratio and mineral deposition. Effects of bFGF on ALPL and ANKH expression were detected within 24 h. Addition of 20 mM fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor SU5402 revealed the necessity of FGFR-mediated signaling, and inclusion of 1 μg/ml cyclohexamide (CHX) implicated the necessity of protein synthesis for effects on ALPL and ANKH. Addition of exogenous 10 μm PP i inhibited mineralization and increased ANKH, collagen type 1a1 (COL1A1), and osteopontin (SPP1) mRNA, while addition of exogenous P i increased mineralization and osterix (OSX), ANKH, SPP1, and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) mRNA. The effects of PP i and P i on mineralization could be replicated by short-term 3- and 7-day treatments, suggesting signaling effects in addition to physicochemical regulation of mineral deposition. Conclusion: This study reveals for the first time the effects of bFGF on P i /PP i regulators in SHEDs and implicates these factors in how bFGF directs osteo/odontogenic differentiation and mineralization by these cells."
"Deep learning using risk-reward function for stock market prediction  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Many recent studies have attempted to apply a deep learning approach to build a model for stock market prediction. Most of these studies have concentrated on using prediction accuracy as a performance metric. Some of them have also performed trading simulations to evaluate financial performance. However, financial performance was not improved significantly because the loss function used in the training process focused primarily on prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new framework to train a deep neural network for stock market prediction. A new loss function was developed by adding a risk-reward function, which is derived by the trading simulation results. A new scoring metric called Sharpe-F1 score, which is a combination of Sharpe ratio and F1 score is used for model selection. We employ the best prediction model from our previous work, which consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) architectures and takes event embedding vectors, historical prices and a set of technical indicators as inputs. The robustness of our framework is evaluated on two datasets by varying the key parameters used in the proposed framework. The results show that financial performance can be improved by adding a risk-reward function into the loss function used in the training process."
"Chest X-ray analysis of tuberculosis by convolutional neural networks with affine transforms  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Applying deep learning techniques for classification of medical images has seen considerable growth in recent years. Among several, Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs) are a class of powerful models well known for image classification and segmentation. This research introduces the concept of computer-aided diagnosis that could help in early diagnosis of Tuberculosis infection. The three CNN architectures: AlexNet, VGG-16 and CapsNet, were customized to classify tuberculosis lesions in CXR images. Data augmentation with rotating was used to mimic the real world as CXR images may not be precisely vertical. The performance of the three classifiers was evaluated with the measures: accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The result showed that CapsNet outperformed the other models when predicting affined images."
"Effect of modified Khon dance performance on functional fitness in older Thai persons  2018, Ladawan Chutimakul, Suchitra Sukonthasab, Thanomwong Kritpet and Chanai Vannalee.Purpose: Aging population is on the rise around the world. Strategies to improve quality of life in this population are being implemented. Exercise is one of those strategies that has been proven to be effective as it produces many health benefits. The purpose of this paper is to determine the effects of Khon exercise on functional fitness in older persons. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 44 older people aged 60–65 years were recruited through a senior club in an urban area. They were divided into two groups: the Khon exercise group (performed exercise for 12 weeks, 60 min/day, 3 times/week) and the control group (engaged in routine physical activity). The Senior Fitness Test, which consisted of chair stand, arm curl, 2-min step, chair sit and reach, back scratch, 8-ft up and go, and body mass index, was performed before and at 12 weeks after the exercise. Findings: After 12 weeks of training, significant differences in chair stand, 2-min step, chair sit and reach, and 8-ft up and go tests were noted between the exercise and control groups. Originality/value: These findings showed that Khon exercise has positive effects on lower body strength and flexibility, aerobic endurance and balance. Hence, it is recommended for health promotion among older persons."
"Social return on investment for community-based alcohol consumption control program during Buddhist Lent  2018, Varangkanar Jirarattanasopha, Nopphol Witvorapong and Piya Hanvoravongchai.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the cost and benefit of a community-based alcohol consumption control program during the Buddhist Lent (BL) period in terms of social return on investment (SROI). Design/methodology/approach: The research team evaluated the program in four selected villages from four regions using standard SROI. Relevant stakeholders were involved in the evaluation design and program impact map construction. Data, including costs, were collected from literatures, official documents, stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions. Alcohol abstinence and related data during and after the 2015 BL period were gathered from a survey questionnaire. The SROI ratio presented the social benefits compared against the total social investment. Findings: The program was effective in producing a greater social value (2.7–5.9 times) than the cost of investment in every village. Cost savings from alcohol consumption constituted a major proportion of the program’s value. Originality/value: The community-based alcohol consumption control program during BL can provide value for investment. Information from this study can be used by policy makers in their decision to continue or scale up the program. The SROI approach mainly relies on stakeholders that may present a bias; however, further study such as social cost-benefit analysis could provide additional insights."
"Medication adherence and associated factors among elderly hypertension patients with uncontrolled blood pressure in rural area, Northeast Thailand  2018, Nanthakan Woodhama, Surasak Taneepanichskul, Ratana Somrongthong and Nanta Auamkul.Purpose: Hypertension is a common disease among elderly. Adherence to antihypertensive medication is a key predictor of optimal blood pressure control that prevents the risk of cardiovascular disease and potentially death. The purpose of this paper is to assess adherence to antihypertension and identify associated factors among the elderly in a rural area, Buengkan province, Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: A health facilities based cross-sectional study was conducted in Buengkan district. A simple random sampling method was used to select 408 participants. A structured questionnaire adapted from the World Health Organization STEPwise approach was used to collect data. The medication adherence level was identified by pill count with percentage ⩾70 defined as good adherence. Descriptive and summary statistics were used. Bivariate analysis was done using Pearson’s χ2 test, and multivariable analyses were also carried out. Findings: A total of 408 (143 males and 265 females) elderly hypertension patients with uncontrolled blood pressure participated in this study. Most of the participants were found to have lower adherence to medication treatment (86.8 percent), whereas the remaining ones (13.2 percent) were found to have good adherence. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that having a daughter as a care taker (adjust odd ratio=7.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–51.778) was significantly associated with high medical adherence. Originality/value: Hypertension medication adherence among elderly patients with uncontrolled blood pressure was poor. Having a care taker, especially a daughter, is a key to improve adherence. Effective strategy to improve adherence should focus on and involve family participation into the program."
"The effects of toothpaste amounts and post-brushing rinsing methods on salivary fluoride retention  2018, Kanyapak Sotthipoka, Pintusorn Thanomsuk, Rungroj Prasopsuk, Chutima Trairatvorakul and Kasekarn Kasevayuth.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the salivary fluoride retention as fluoride concentration, amount of soluble fluoride, half-life (t1/2) and salivary flow rate of different amounts of toothpaste and rinsing procedures. Design/methodology/approach: A randomized crossover study of 21 healthy volunteers was designed to compare pharmacokinetic parameters of 1 g (B1) and 0.3 g (B0.3) of toothpaste without rinsing and brushing with 1 g of toothpaste with expectoration followed by water rinsing (B1R). Unstimulated saliva was collected before brushing as a baseline and at 0, 5, 10, 30, 60 and 90 min after the completion of the tooth brushing procedure. Findings: The salivary fluoride concentration and amount of soluble fluoride of the B1 group were significantly higher than the B0.3 and B1R groups. The B1 and B1R groups prolonged the remineralizing level up to 60 min while the B0.3 group retained their remineralizing levels for 30 min. The initial t1/2 (rapid phase) of B1 and B1R groups were significantly longer than the B0.3 group. The late t1/2 (slow phase) of the B0.3 group was significantly longer than the B1 group. This is called the two-compartment open pharmacokinetics model. There was no statistical difference of salivary flow rates between all groups. Originality/value: Non-rinsing and the amount of fluoride toothpaste play an important role in raising salivary fluoride levels and prolonging the remineralizing level of the oral cavity."

"Downstream components of the calmodulin signaling pathway in the rice salt stress response revealed by transcriptome profiling and target identification  2018 The Author(s).Background: Calmodulin (CaM) is an important calcium sensor protein that transduces Ca2+ signals in plant stress signaling pathways. A previous study has revealed that transgenic rice over-expressing the calmodulin gene OsCam1-1 (LOC_Os03g20370) is more tolerant to salt stress than wild type. To elucidate the role of OsCam1-1 in the salt stress response mechanism, downstream components of the OsCam1-1-mediated response were identified and investigated by transcriptome profiling and target identification. Results: Transcriptome profiling of transgenic 'Khao Dawk Mali 105' rice over-expressing OsCam1-1 and wild type rice showed that overexpression of OsCam1-1 widely affected the expression of genes involved in several cellular processes under salt stress, including signaling, hormone-mediated regulation, transcription, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glyoxylate cycle. Under salt stress, the photosynthesis rate in the transgenic rice was slightly lower than in wild type, while sucrose and starch contents were higher, suggesting that energy and carbon metabolism were affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression. Additionally, four known and six novel CaM-interacting proteins were identified by cDNA expression library screening with the recombinant OsCaM1. GO terms enriched in their associated proteins that matched those of the differentially expressed genes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression revealed various downstream cellular processes that could potentially be regulated by OsCaM1 through their actions. Conclusions: The diverse cellular processes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression and possessed by the identified CaM1-interacting proteins corroborate the notion that CaM signal transduction pathways compose a complex network of downstream components involved in several cellular processes. These findings suggest that under salt stress, CaM activity elevates metabolic enzymes involved in central energy pathways, which promote or at least maintain the production of energy under the limitation of photosynthesis."

We take advantage of the current 3D printers' capabilities of combining highly concentrated inks with a large number of layers, to expand the spectral gamut of a set of inks. We use a data-driven method to both predict the spectrum of a printed ink stack and optimize for the stack layout that best matches a target spectrum. This bidirectional mapping is modeled using a pair of neural networks, which are optimized through a problem-specific multi-objective loss function. Our loss function helps find the best possible ink layout resulting in the balance between spectral reproduction and colorimetric accuracy under a multitude of illuminants. In addition, we introduce a novel spectral vector error diffusion algorithm based on combining color contoning and halftoning, which simultaneously solves the layout discretization and color quantization problems, accurately and efficiently. Our workflow outperforms the state-of-the-art models for spectral prediction and layout optimization. We demonstrate reproduction of a number of real paintings and historically important pigments using our prototype implementation that uses 10 custom inks with varying spectra and a resin-based 3D printer."
"Carbonized briquettes as a tool for adding value to waste from rain tree (Samanea saman) and coffee ground/tea waste  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The purpose of this research was to study the physical and economic characteristics of carbonized briquettes from rain tree (Samanea saman) residues and coffee ground/tea waste with cassava starch (10% wt.). This experiment utilized five treatments. As a binder, 10% wt. cassava starch was added to five ratios of rain tree residues to coffee ground/tea waste: RT100:CT0, RT75:CT25, RT50:CT50, RT25:CT75, and RT0:CT100. The physical properties of the carbonized briquettes were analyzed using ASTM methods. The results showed that carbonized briquettes made from 50% rain tree (Samanea saman) residues and 50% coffee ground/tea waste (RT50:CT50) had the highest calorific value (20.17 ± 0.042 MJ/kg)—insignificant at the 95% confidence interval—and highest shatter index (99.16 ± 0.20%). However, all ratios of rain tree residues to coffee ground/tea waste can produce carbonized briquettes for household use, convenient for transportation. In terms of economic performance, carbonized briquettes made from 50% rain tree (Samanea saman) residues and 50% coffee ground/tea waste (RT50:CT50) achieved the optimal payback period (approximately six months). Thus, making carbonized briquettes from rain tree residues and coffee ground/tea waste a viable alternative method of adding value to biomass residue for use as raw materials to produce fuel products for household cooking."
"Periodic-review policy for a 2-Echelon inventory problem with seasonal demand  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.This paper studies a two-level inventory system with one warehouse and N retailers under seasonal demand. All locations apply periodic review base-stock policy with echelon stock concept. The objective is to determine an inventory policy with the minimum inventory cost respected to required service level. Three ways to determine inventory policies are proposed which are upper, lower and EOQ alternatives. Among these alternatives, it is found that upper-alternative policies tend to give the lowest cost which is around 17% lower than other policies. EOQ-alternative policies give the lowest cost in some instances with zero ordering cost. However, lower-alternative policies lead to the lower demand loss, its highest average loss in one instance is 0.07% while other policies’ loss can be as high as 0.22%."
"Reference stress approach for fracture assessment of extrados circumferential through-wall crack between elbow and pipe under internal pressure  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The fracture assessment of a cracked component can provide technical support for an effective maintenance and a prevention of catastrophic accident. The present study applies the reference stress method to extend the J-integral solution from the finite element analysis for the Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain relationship to other types of stress-strain relationship. The problem in this study is an extrados circumferential through-wall crack at the interface between elbow and pipe subjected to internal pressure. The finite element results from the literature were analyzed to determine the optimized reference pressure. The fracture loads predicted by the reference-stress-based failure assessment curve which incorporated with the optimized reference pressure were compared with those predicted by the finite-element-based failure assessment curve. The failure load predicted from the reference-stress-based failure assessment curve deviated from that predicted from the finite-element-based failure assessment curve within the range of-7% to 11%."
"Atmospheric water estimation using GNSS precise point positioning method  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The rapid adoption of the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) technology in our modern daily life brings the opportunity to investigate its applicability to areas beyond positioning, navigation and timing, such as meteorology. Due to its high accuracy performance, GNSS (PPP) Precise Point Positioning has become an attractive tool to retrieve the precipitable water vapor (PWV) from the atmosphere. Apart of the GNSS observations, PPP PWV retrieval also requires surface pressure and temperature measurements to calculate precisely the wet part of the tropospheric delay and convert it to PWV. This research reports on the atmospheric water estimation using GNSS PPP method. GNSS observations from CUSV IGS tracking station are combined with IGS precise data in order to obtain the best PPP estimates. Forward and backward solutions are combined using a weighted normalized approach. In addition, observation data from two meteorological stations is used in PWV estimation. The numerical analysis covered the entire year of 2016. Our analyses show that PPP combined solutions are in very good agreement with IGS official products in terms of coordinates and zenith tropospheric delays. In addition, PPP PWV estimates display seasonal and temporal variation in the water content of the atmosphere. The PWV values over 65 mm were found to be from May to November, whereas they were on average 20% lower for the other months of the year. Furthermore, PWV estimates were found to be correlated with local rainfall events recorded at the meteorological stations. Our research concludes that GNSS data processing using PPP method provides high accuracy solution that may be used for retrieving reliably information about the water content in the atmosphere."
"Development of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-organic fertilizer pellets encapsulated with alginate film  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.A novel formulation consisting of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spores mixed with sterilized organic fertilizer (AMF-F) encapsulated by an insoluble calcium alginate film was developed to enhance AMF efficacy and stability. The hardness of the pellets increased from 7–8 N to approximately 80 N by increasing the alginate concentration of the coating film from 1 to 3%. The AMF spore germination rate for the AMF and AMF-F pellets coated with calcium alginate films depended on the alginate concentration. A 2% sodium alginate formulation for the coating films resulted in optimal AMF spore germination rates and mechanical properties for handling, transport, and stability. The inclusion of a sterilized organic fertilizer in the encapsulated AMF-F pellets considerably induced AMF mycelial growth and helped prolong the shelf life of the pellets. In soil, the AMF-F pellets encapsulated with alginate (cAMF-F) initially degraded faster than the alginate-encapsulated AMF pellets (cAMF). However, both types of pellets were fully degraded within 30 days. It was demonstrated that cAMF and cAMF-F could promote colonization and provided resistance to drought stress in maize potted plants."
"Cross-sectoral analysis of water usage in Thailand using input–output model  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Thailand currently ranks third among the most water-intensive countries in the world. The percentage shares of water demand in the country’s agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors, which are major economic sectors, are 75%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. With the continuous growth of the economy, the demand for water is steadily rising, while the expansion of water supply remains constrained by several factors and the water supply is also affected by climate change. This study uses the input–output model to examine the relationship between water usage and the economic system in Thailand in 2010. The constructed input–output model is the integration of the Leontief inverse matrix, the matrix of water usage, and the details of the gross domestic product (GDP). The model indicates the linkage between GDP expansion and water demand in both direct and indirect usage. The computation result obtained from the model indicates that the agricultural sector is the major water user, with its ratio of direct water use being the highest. The manufacturing sector records the highest ratio of indirect water use, which is influenced by its supply chain comprising the agriculture and service sectors. This model and its results may serve as the main foundation for the design of economic and environmental policies oriented toward optimizing water demand and supply. The model can also be extended and enriched with detailed mechanisms of economic behavior to allow further complex analyzes such as water pricing policies."
"Speculation of nano-gap sensor for DNA sequencing technology: A review on synthetic nanopores  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Nano-gap sensor is the next generation of single molecule analysis that consumes less resources, costs, times and spaces. The ultimate goal of this technology is rendering the ability to determine any living genetic code in several seconds using this portable device. In principle, DNA decryption was determined by tracking electrical signal change when DNA is passed through either natural or synthetic nanometer size gap. This review focuses on the synthetic nanopore, which is more robust, reliable and manageable with ease. Biological nanopore has been researched in parallel; however, the device reproducibility is a controversial issue. The history and development toward the future of this prospect technology will be elaborated attentively. The main limitation of nanopore sensor device is the controlling of DNA translocation dynamic through tiny pore. Many attempts had been tried and the synopsis will be contemplated in the review. Nonetheless, the present results of DNA sequencing have not been satisfied, the development of nanogap sensor is promising for genomic sequencing and molecular biology."
"Peat Endogenous Lignocellulolytic Bacteria for Humic Waste Decomposition  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. The low carrying capacity of the peat soil makes a consideration to accelerate peatland decomposition through the addition of endogenous lignocellulolytic bacteria. These bacteria can use nutrients found in the peat soil and secrete enzymes to accelerate peat decomposition. In this study, endogenous lignocellulolytic bacteria from Palangkaraya peat soil, Kalimantan was used in lab scale decomposition experiments. These bacteria were added into the peat soil and incubated for six weeks. Analysis of peat fiber decomposition was performed weekly and at the end of the incubation period, bacteria colony was counted using total plate count method. The results showed that all bacteria can decomposed peat soil with an average value of 86%. The number of bacterial colonies at the end of incubation ranges from 3.0 × 10 3 to 6.7 × 10 4 CFU/ml. This study can be used as a preliminary study of peat soil decomposition that subsequently can be developed through analyzing several factors to stabilize peats oil area."
"Relationships between causal factors affecting future carbon dioxide output from Thailand's transportation sector under the government's sustainability policy: Expanding the SEM-VECM model  2019 by the authors.This research aims to analyze the relationships between causal factors likely to affect future CO2 emissions from the Thai transportation sector by developing the Structural Equation Modeling-Vector Autoregressive Error Correction Mechanism Model (SEM-VECM Model). This model was created to fill information gaps of older models. In addition, the model provides the unique feature of viable model application for different sectors in various contexts. The model revealed all exogenous variables that have direct and indirect influences over changes in CO2 emissions. The variables show a direct effect at a confidence interval of 99%, including per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1), labor growth (Δln(L)t-1), urbanization rate factor (Δln(URT)t-1), industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1), energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1), foreign direct investment (Δln(FDI)t-1), oil price (Δln(OP)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1). In addition, it was found that every variable in the SEM-VECM model has an indirect effect on changes in CO2 emissions at a confidence interval of 99%. The SEM-VECM model has the ability to adjust to the equilibrium equivalent to 39%. However, it also helps to identify the degree of direct effect that each causal factor has on the others. Specifically, labor growth (Δln(L)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) and energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, while urbanization rate (Δln(URT)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1), labor growth (Δln(L)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Furthermore, industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, whereas energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Foreign direct investment (Δln(FDI)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%, while oil price (Δln(OP)t-1) had a direct effect on industrial structure (Δln(IS)t-1), energy consumption (Δln(EC)t-1), and net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. Lastly, net exports (Δln(X - E)t-1) had a direct effect on per capita GDP (Δln(GDP)t-1) at a confidence interval of 99%. The model eliminates the problem of heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, and autocorrelation. In addition, it was found that the model is white noise. When the SEM-VECM Model was used for 30-year forecasting (2018-2047), it projected that CO2 emissions would increase steadily by 67.04% (2047/2018) or 123.90 Mt CO2 Eq. by 2047. The performance of the SEM-VECM Model was assessed and produced a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.21% and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.02%. When comparing the performance value with the values of other, older models, the SEM-VECM Model was found to be more effective and useful for future research and policy planning for Thailand's sustainability goals."
"Mechanochemical-assisted heterogeneous surface modification of parawood microcrystalline cellulose and its effect on the properties of polypropylene composites  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this work was to modify the surface of parawood sawdust (Hevea brasiliensis) microcrystalline cellulose (PW-MCC) used as reinforcing agent in polypropylene composites with benzoyl chloride under a mechanochemistry process. Design/methodology/approach: The acetylated PW-MCC was produced from heterogeneous condition using planetary ball mill process at a rotation speed of 400 rpm. Before the esterification reaction, PW-MCC was pre-treated with pyridine at 60°C for 1 h in order to penetrate and swell the cellulose structure. The optimum condition of esterified PW-MCC with various molar ratios of benzoyl chloride/anhydroglucose unit (AGU) was studied. The degree of substitution, functional group, thermal stability and morphology of esterified cellulose were characterized by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings: The functional group from FTIR confirmed that PW-MCC was successfully esterified with benzoyl chloride. The optimum condition which gave the maximum degree of substitution at 3.00 was achieved by using benzoyl chloride/AGU at 5 for 1 h. SEM analysis revealed that the modified PW-MCC surface became rougher than the unmodified PW-MCC surface. The polypropylene composites with 5-30 wt% PW-MCC and esterified PW-MCC were prepared without compatibilizer. Originality/value: The composites with esterified PW-MCC enhanced water resistance and thermal stability when compared to composites with PW-MCC."
"Sequential Fractionation of Palm Empty Fruit Bunch and Microwave-Assisted Depolymerization of Lignin for Producing Monophenolic Compounds  2018 American Chemical Society.We develop a sequential fractionation of palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) and microwave-assisted depolymerization of lignin for producing monophenolic compounds with high yields. EFB has been known as a low-priced and abandoned residue from the palm oil milling process due to its low heating value and generation of toxic gases upon burning; therefore, valorization of EFB has been an important task for circular economy. In this study, a subsequent alkaline hot compressed water fractionation to separate hemicellulose and lignin from cellulose has been studied. The lignin separation by lignin precipitation and a filtration process followed by microwave-assisted lignin oxidative depolymerization to high value phenolic compounds was proposed. We systematically screened many catalysts as well as investigated reaction conditions (such as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, reaction time, etc.) to achieve the highest yield of lignin-derived phenolic compounds. It was found that the optimal conditions for depolymerization of pretreated EFB lignin were (i) NaOH solution with 2.5% (w/w) hydrogen peroxide, (ii) microwave (300 W) for 15 min, and (iii) bimetallic Cu(OH)2 and Fe2O3 catalysts. The highest percentage of the total phenolic compound concentration peak area is 91.78%, including 42.84% of syringol, 5.42% of vanillin, 8.71% of acetovanillone, 6.65% of syringaldehyde, and 28.16% of acetosyringone. The proposed sequential fractionation and microwave-assisted treatment would be promising for converting other lignocellulosic raw biomass to useful phenolic compounds."
"Enhancement of Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Performance of Graphitic Carbon Nitride with Incorporated Nickel Boride  2018 American Chemical Society.Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) functioning as a semiconductor catalyst and sustainable and clean energy carrier to substitute fossil energy is gaining the attention of researchers. Hydrogen is regarded as the right energy carrier to meet future conditions, and hence, developing hydrogen economy is intensively investigated for its great electrocatalytic property. However, it is blocked as an electrocatalyst due to its poor conductivity and electrochemical activity. Therefore, to conquer such shortcomings, changing the nanostructure and increasing active sites are studied. Here, we report a facile method by incorporation of nickel boride (Ni2B) nanoparticles into bulk g-C3N4 to enlarge the specific surface area, exfoliate the layers, and improve the electronic conductivity. The obtained catalysts exhibit better hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low onset overpotential of 300 mV, a Tafel slope of 221 mV dec-1, and an overpotential of 707 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, superior to original g-C3N4 which demonstrates that Ni2B-decorated g-C3N4 is an illuminating method to enhance the HER performance. This work also provides a reference for g-C3N4 based catalyst working in broader field."
"Hemostatic efficacy of sheep-derived fibrin glue for liver biopsy in swine  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Fibrin glue has been widely used for controlling hemorrhage and sealing tissue in surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy of sheep-derived fibrin glue. Six Marino sheep were used to collect concentrate fibrinogen preparation by the ammonium sulfate precipitation method. Crossbred pigs (n=6) were used to evaluate hemostatic efficacy by monitoring whole blood clotting time by the glass slide method, bleeding time and bleeding quantity during liver biopsy. Mean whole blood clotting time on a glass slide started at 201.1±90.47 and 4.43±3.73 seconds, and was completed at 447.83±63.77 and 31.93±4.28 seconds in control and treatment groups respectively. Two-sited open liver biopsies were performed, each biopsy site was assigned as either control or treatment groups. One ml of sheep-derived fibrin glue on the bleeding surface was applied at the treatment sited group. Bleeding quantity was estimated by the increased weight of filter paper after blood straining. Mean bleeding quantity was 0.94±0.38 and 0.1±0.12 g, and mean bleeding time was 175.18±11.80 and 68.08±28.84 seconds in control and treatment sites, respectively. Whole blood clotting time, bleeding time, and bleeding quantity were significantly less in the treatment-sited group, compared to the control-sited group (p<0.01). In conclusion sheep-derived fibrin glue could be applied as an effective hemostatic agent to control hemorrhage after liver biopsy in swine."
"Plasmid profile of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolated from pigs, pork and humans in Thai-Laos border provinces  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.This study aimed to determine plasmid profile of E. faecium and E. faecalis isolated from pigs, pig products and humans in Thailand-Laos border provinces. A total of 96 Enterococcus spp. including E. faecium (n=59) and E. faecalis (n=37) from pigs, pork and humans were included. All were determined for their antimicrobial susceptibilities and plasmid profile. Most isolates (96.9%) carried one to four plasmids with a molecular weight of 0.03 -35 kb in E. faecium and 19-40 kb in E. faecalis. The 26 kb plasmid was most commonly detected. Variable plasmid profiles were defined, of which the most common pattern was, 23 kb in E. faecalis and, 35 kb in E. faecium. In conclusion, the results indicate a wide distribution of plasmids among the Enterococcus isolates originating from pig, pork and humans in this strain collection and confirm the important role of commensal E. faecium and E. faecalis as a reservoir for the emergence and spread of AMR among food animals and humans."
"Computed tomographic contrast enhancement and tumor angiogenesis in canine oral tumors  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.The potential value of bolus tracking contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of oral tumors in dogs was investigated by examining the relationship between contrast-enhanced CT image density and microvascularization. Among 20 dogs with oral tumors, aged 8 – 17 years, weight 3.6 – 40.0 kg, 13 dogs were suffering with melanoma (MM), 4 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 3 with fibrosarcoma. Based on contrast-enhanced CT scan, the time lag from the injection of contrast medium into the right cephalic vein until the contrast medium returned to the mid-cervical external jugular vein at the level of the 4th cervical vertebrae significantly correlated with body weight (p < 0.01). The mean of post-contrast-enhancement increase in intra-tumor image density, measured in Hounsfield Units (HU), was 127.09 ± 38.58%, with the highest values detected in SCC (166.88 ± 23.47%, p < 0.05), followed by MM (122.78 ± 37.90%) and fibrosarcoma (99.37 ± 31.58%). The mean of microvessel density (MVD, a measure of vascularization determined by vWF-immunohistochemistry) of all tumors was 36.7 ± 11.7 vessels/mm2, with the highest MVD values in SCC (47.5 ± 5.3 vessels/mm2, p < 0.05), followed by MM (35.3 ± 11.6 vessels/mm2) and fibrosarcoma (27.2 ± 6.5 vessel/mm2). The values for MVD and intra-tumor HU in post-contrasted-enhanced CT scans significantly correlated (p < 0.01)."
"Efficacy of different vaccination programs of recombinant HVT-NDV vaccine against genotype VII NDV Challenge in broiler chickens  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.This study determined the efficacy of recombinant HVT- NDV (rHVT- NDV) vaccine simultaneously vaccinated with live vaccine at 1 day old and a booster vaccination with live vaccine at 10 days old against Asiatic, Genotype VII NDV in broiler chickens. The chickens were divided into 5 groups. The chickens in groups 1, 2 and 3 were vaccinated with rHVT- NDV vaccine and different live vaccines at 1 day old, and then finally received a booster vaccination at 10 days old. The chickens in groups 4 and 5 served as the positive and negative control groups, respectively. The chickens in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were challenged with NDV at 14, 21, 28 and 35 days old, 20 chickens of each group at a time. Clinical signs and mortality were observed for 14 days after each time of challenge. Blood samples were collected at 1 and 10 days old, on the virus inoculation day and 14 days post- inoculation, to determine NDV antibodies. Swab samples were collected from the chickens challenged with the virus at 35 days old to detect NDV RNA by real- time PCR. The results reveal that the protection rate of the vaccinated chickens, which were challenged at 14 days old was 70- 95%, while the protection rate of all vaccinated groups increased to 90- 100% when they were challenged at 21, 28 or 35 days old. The vaccinated groups had a lower rate of virus shedding when compared to the challenged control group. It is concluded that all of the vaccination programs of rHVT-NDV vaccine in this study could be used to reduce economic loss due to infection by Genotype VII NDV."
"Emergence of a classical variant of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus novel to Thailand responsible for the milder clinical disease in a herd previously infected with a pandemic variant  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.In 2014, porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) outbreaks characterized by mild clinical disease and low pre-weaning mortality increased in frequency in Thailand. An outbreak investigation, based on the detection of the classical variant and the allowance of the herd owners, was conducted in 5 swine herds and 25 intestinal samples were submitted from herds with outbreaks of diarrhea for sequencing analysis. PEDV isolation and complete nucleotide sequences of the spike (S) glycoprotein were determined. The PEDV isolate EAS1 was identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length spike gene demonstrated that EAS1 belonged to the classical variant group with high nucleotide and amino acid identity (98.4-99.0% and 96.6-97.9%) with LZC and SM98, which are the Chinese and Korean classical variant PEDVs, respectively. The results suggest the emergence of a classical variant PEDV responsible for the mild clinical disease in Thailand. The introduction could have been due to the use of illegally imported modified live vaccines from other countries."
"Comparative ultrasonographic and computed tomographic images of the adrenal glands of healthy cats  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Feline adrenal disorders that affect the size of the adrenal glands can be detected by diagnostic imaging including ultrasonography and Computed Tomography (CT). The objectives of this study were to compare the appearance of the adrenal gland in healthy cats between these two techniques and establish the reference values of the CT dimensions of the adrenal gland in cats. We found that there was no significant difference in the length of both adrenal glands between the two techniques but the cranial and caudal heights of the left adrenal glands and cranial height of the right adrenal gland obtained from the CT images in post-contrast enhanced-phase were significantly thicker than those obtained from ultrasonography. Our results suggest the reference values (mean±SD) of the left adrenal gland length, cranial, and caudal heights as 11.12 ± 2.65, 3.69 ± 0.72, and 3.70 ± 0.77 mm, respectively, and those of the right adrenal gland as 11.00 ± 2.33, 3.80 ± 0.99, and 3.53 ± 0.73 mm, respectively. The dimensions of both adrenal glands obtained from ultrasonography have more positive correlation with the age and body weight of the cats when compared with those obtained from the CT. Different sensitivity between the two techniques might be the cause and the images obtained from ultrasonography might be affected by the positioning and bodyweight of the patient."
"A preliminary study on diversity of midgut microbiota in Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) collected from Bangkok, Thailand  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus are important mosquito vectors for many infectious diseases. A number of factors affect the vector competence of these mosquitoes for a specific pathogen. The bacteria harbored in the midgut are known to influence mosquito physiology and can alter the response to various pathogens. Bacteria from the midgut of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus were cultured and identified using bacteriological and molecular techniques in this study in which two groups of mosquitoes were examined. The first group was laboratory- reared, and the second group were field- collected mosquitoes from Bangkok. Twelve bacterial genera (i. e., Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium, Bacillus, Cellulomonas, Chryseomicrobium, Dietzia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Microbacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus) were identified from laboratory- reared Ae. aegypti and eight bacterial genera (i. e., Bacillus, Cellulomonas, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Moraxella, Neisseria, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) were determined from field- collected Ae. aegypti. Five bacterial genera (i. e., Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus) were identified from laboratory- reared Cx. quinquefasciatus and 13 bacterial genera (i. e., Acinetobacter, Actinomyces, Bacillus, Chryseobacterium, Kocuria, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Novosphingobium, Pantoea, Providencia, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Staphylococcus) were examined from field- collected Cx. quinquefasciatus. The variation of these midgut microbiota may influence mosquito vector competence for a specific pathogen. However, further studies need to be performed to indicate this relationship."
"Concomitant mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm and lumbar tuberculous spondylitis with cauda equina syndrome: a rare condition — a case report and literature review  2018, International Spinal Cord Society.Introduction: Concomitant mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm and lumbar tuberculous spondylitis with psoas abscess and cauda equina syndrome is extremely rare. This condition can cause serious life-threatening problems if not diagnosed and treated properly. Case presentation: We report an unusual case of a 79-year-old Thai male, who was diagnosed with concomitant mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm and lumbar tuberculous spondylitis at the L2–L3 level with left psoas abscess and cauda equina syndrome. The surgical plan was radical surgical debridement via transpsoas approach and the defect was filled with iliac crest strut graft and posterior decompressive laminectomy and fusion with a pedicle screws and rods system. During the operation, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was iatrogenically ruptured and then was emergently treated with endovascular stent graft implantation. Subsequently, hemostasis was achieved and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. A few days later, he underwent posterior decompressive laminectomy L2–L3, fusion and instrumentation with a pedicle screws and rods system at T11-L5. After surgery, the patient recovered well and his motor power improved gradually. He was continually treated with anti-tuberculous chemotherapy for 12 months. Discussion: Concomitant mycotic aortic aneurysm and lumbar tuberculous spondylitis with psoas abscess and cauda equina syndrome is an extremely rare condition that requires prompt diagnosis and management. Its consequences can lead to serious complications such as permanent neurological damage, paralysis or even death, if left untreated. The aims of the treatment are to eradicate infection, to prevent further neurological compromise, to stabilize the spine and to protect the aortic aneurysm from rupture."
"Predicting the present revisited: The case of Thailand  2018 Thammasat University.Google is currently the most widely used search engine in the world. There are approximately 3.5 billion searches conducted on Google each day. With real-Time processing, Google Trends data can be used in a prediction technique called 'nowcasting' (or ""predicting the present"") using current period real-Time information to estimate current period indicators of interest. In this paper, we show how Google Trends can be used for nowcasting various Thai economic indicators. The areas analyzed are (i) the labor market sector (unemployment registration and unemployment rate), (ii) the real sector (automobile sales), and (iii) the financial sector (the SET index). The results revealed that incorporating Google Trends data into prediction models improved both the Adjusted R-Squared and predication accuracies under various measures."
"Survival time and prognosis factors in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cats with congestive heart failure  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common myocardial disease in cats. Nowadays, there is no study determining the survival time of cats affected with HCM in Thailand. This study aimed to evaluate the survival time in HCM cats with congestive heart failure (CHF) in Thailand and to determine the factors associating with survival time. A retrospective study was performed in 47 HCM cats to analyze survival time and the association of survival time and factors including sex, age, breeds, weight, physical findings, the presence of complications, medication and echocardiographic findings. The data was analyzed by the Log-Rank test and displayed with the Kaplan-Meier curve. The results reveal that the median survival time of HCM cats with CHF was 283 days and factors associating with a lesser survival time were the presence of aortic thromboembolism (ATE), a decrease in left ventricular internal dimension at end-diastole (LVIDd) < 10.8 mm and the use of other cardiovascular drugs besides the combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and furosemide. The data of this study is valuable for prognosis and for the future management of HCM cats with CHF."
"The potential use of phytoestrogen containing the herb, Pueraria mirifica, for bone healing in osteoporotic monkeys  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Within the last decade, the positive effects of Pueraria mirifica on osteoporosis have been established in rats and monkeys. However, the effect of P. mirifica on bone healing has not been elucidated. In this study, post-menopausal osteoporotic monkeys were subjected to an iliac crest biopsy, divided into two groups (5 animals/group), and fed daily with standard monkey diet alone (PMP0 group) or mixed with 1,000 mg/kg body weight of P. mirifica powder (PMP1000 group) for 16 months. The progression of the bone healing was continuously assessed by X-ray radiography, and three individuals from each group were selected for a computed tomographic (CT) scan at 0, 8 and 16 months. The individual from each group that showed the greatest progression of bone healing, based upon the CT image, was selected for a second biopsy of the right ilium after 16 months of treatment and histological changes determined. The perimeter and area measured by the X-ray radiograph were significantly decreased earlier in the PMP1000 group compared to the PMP0 group, and the significant differences of the perimeter between the groups were detected in month 3, 6 and 8. The 3D-CT scan showed a progressive bone healing in one PMP1000 individual, while histological examination indicated a lower number of fibrocartilage cells and a higher amount of new bone formation compared to the PMP0 monkey. In conclusion, PMP treatment could accelerate the progression of bone fracture healing in naturally postmenopausal osteoporotic monkeys, in addition to the previously reported amelioration of bone loss."
"Dynamic symmetry breaking in sat using augmented clauses with a polynomial-time lexicographic pruning  2018 IEEE.Dynamic symmetry breaking in Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT) is often performed by adding symmetric versions of the learned clauses into the clause database. Using a notion of augmented clause every symmetric version can be learned. The task of unit propagation is then transformed into a search problem under a permutation group. Our work focuses on a special kind of symmetry called row symmetry. We present the optimization to the search problem under a group containing row symmetry subgroups mainly relies on lexicographic pruning and the fact that some instances can be reduced to minimal assignment problems. We also introduce a construction of subgroups of row symmetry groups to ensure that every sub-task could be performed in polynomial time. Lastly, we discuss the implementation of our technique and some of the technical issue that needed to be address."
"Approximation of positive integer in double-base number system with a single term  2018 IEEE.The double-base number system (DBNS) designed for parallel computing which has an advantage in arithmetic operations especially for multiplication and addition. Many exponential properties and identity rules had been proposed in order to simplify arithmetic operations. Unfortunately, division seem to have many disadvantages in the case that a denominator contains many terms. A single term representation for any number is investigated in this work. We proposed an approximation algorithm for reducing a number of terms, especially for an integer. We also proposed a division algorithm together with the proof of correctness. Finally, reduction of an operation time is shown to be realized using a preprocessing table. We expect the idea of this paper may be useful for future works which are related to some researches in hardware design or computer architecture."
"Machine learning methods for abnormality detection in hard disk drive assembly process: Bi-LSTM, Wavelet-CNN and SVM  2018 IEEE.The research proposes methods to detect abnormality in assembly of a hard disk drive. Three machine learning techniques are employed to classify the drives from assembly process into good and bad class. A good class represent a drive that all components are properly installed while a bad class represent an abnormal drive that some components are missing or improperly installed. The voice coil motor current motor is measured and collected from physical drives in assembly line for using as training and testing data set. Since the amount of bad drives in hard disk drive assembly process are much smaller than the good drive which introduce the imbalance problem during training process, this paper also set the experiment of varying amount of training data set that can satisfy the training in practical hard disk drive assembly process. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Wavelet transform with Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are chosen as proposed machine learning models to classify this task. The comparison between each technique is discussed."
"ALMA twenty-six arcmin2 survey of GOODS-S at one millimeter (ASAGAO): Source catalog and number counts  The Author(s) 2018.We present the survey design, data reduction, construction of images, and source catalog of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) twenty-six arcmin2 survey of GOODS-S at one millimeter (ASAGAO). ASAGAO is a deep (1 σ depth ∼ 61 μJy beam−1 for a 250 kλ-tapered map with a synthesized beam size of 0.51 × 0.45) and wide area (26 arcmin2) survey on a contiguous field at 1.2 mm. By combining with ALMA archival data in the GOODS-South field, we obtained a deeper map in the same region (1 σ depth ∼ 30 μJy beam−1 for a deep region with a 250 kλ-taper, and a synthesized beam size of 0.59 × 0.53), providing the largest sample of sources (25 sources at ≥5.0 σ, 45 sources at ≥4.5 σ) among ALMA blank-field surveys to date. The number counts show that 52+−118 % of the extragalactic background light at 1.2 mm is resolved into discrete sources at S1.2 mm > 135 μJy. We create infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) in the redshift range of z = 1–3 from the ASAGAO sources with Ks-band counterparts, and constrain the faintest luminosity of the LF at 2.0 < z < 3.0. The LFs are consistent with previous results based on other ALMA and SCUBA-2 observations, which suggest a positive luminosity evolution and negative density evolution with increasing redshift. We find that obscured star-formation of sources with IR luminosities of log (LIR/L) 11.8 account for ≈60%–90% of the z ∼ 2 cosmic star-formation rate density."
"Railway network modeling using building block of timed coloured petri nets  2018 IEEE.Formal verification is likely an alternative to check safety property of the system model. However, to design an abstract model of huge railway network manually may cause errors because of its complexity. This paper proposes an alternative to generate a formal railway network model from the building blocks of Timed Coloured Petri Nets. Instead of constructing the formal model of a railway network model from scratch using CPN Tools, we provide a set of predefined building blocks of the high-level railway network components, including a train station building block, a rail building block, etc. A set of mapping rules are provided to generate the high-level railway network in terms of building blocks, into Timed Coloured Petri Nets automatically. The resulting formal model is verified using CPN Tools to ensure the correctness, safety, and liveness of the formal railway network model."
"Refactoring orchestrated web services into microservices using decomposition pattern  2018 IEEE.Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural design of inter-services collaborations. In general, SOA has three major roles, including client, service provider, and service broker. To access a service usually depends on a service broker, which causes inflexibility in system modification. The software industry now focuses more on productivity, flexibility of the constant changes and continuous modifications, for which the SOA style may not be suitable. Therefore, a new microservice style is an alternative serving those needs, which means a microservice unit is more adaptable and replaceable with no ripple effects. Since the microservice architecture design is considered as a collection of the small self-contained services, each service represents a business capability and carries its own isolated data. However, how to identify microservices is still a challenging task in the business process model level. This paper proposes an alternative mean to extract the existing SOA services from the BPEL flow and refactor them into a set of relevant microservices using the decomposition pattern. In our case study, we propose how to do the service refactoring against the business domain profiles collected from the extracted vocabularies from the given business scenarios. The resulting microservices are domain specific and conform to the business capability vocabularies extracted from the given business scenarios."
"Skin Barrier Function and Atopic Dermatitis  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review was to highlight the importance of the skin barrier in the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). Recent Findings: Skin barrier function relies on the stratum corneum (SC) and tight junction. These components are deranged in the AD epidermis. Deficiency in filaggrin gives rise to abnormal epidermal integrity. The intercellular lipid composition, ratio, and organization are found to be disturbed. Keratinocyte shedding from the SC is also impaired. Tight junction proteins are reduced and result in sweat leakage into the skin surface. Summary: Strategies to enhance skin barrier strength will alleviate AD symptoms and may prevent the disease."
"Corundum with spinel corona from the Tan Huongtruc Lau area in Northern Vietnam  2018 Gemological Institute of America.Corundum deposits in the Tan Huong-Truc Lau area of Vietnam are hosted mainly in gneiss and partly in feldspathic pegmatoid and marble. Encountered here in both primary and secondary placer deposits is a considerable quantity of stones with a well-developed spinel corona following the morphology of the corundum core. The genesis of the observed spinel corona can be explained by their reaction textures, chemical composition, and mineral inclusions as well as by applying thermodynamic phase equilibria calculations. The following reactions were found to be responsible for the formation of the spinel corona around corundum in gneiss: biotite + corundum → spinel + K-feldspar + fluid, or garnet+corundum → spinel + sillimanite For corundum-spinel associations in metacarbonate rocks, the relevant reaction is: dolomite + corundum → spinel + calcite + carbon dioxide Mineralogical and chemical studies have shown that the gem quality of ruby and sapphire grains from Tan Huong-Truc Lau deteriorated substantially after their formation due to this corona texture."
"Effect of food additives on the quality of white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)  2018 The Authors.The effects of three additives: sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) with the addition of 2% sodium chloride (NaCl) at different concentrations (2, 5 and 8%) and times (10, 30 and 60 minutes) at 4±2°C on the quality of frozen-thawed white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were studied. In average, compared to control, different concentrations and immersion times of three additives with 2% NaCl significantly (p<0.05) affected the water holding capacity (WHC), cooking weight loss (CL), weight gain (WG), moisture content (MC) and microbial load (TVC) of white shrimps. The combined effect of 2% NaCl with all additives showed synergistic effect on reducing CL, increased WHC and yielded a good quality of frozen-thawed white shrimps. Treatment by immersions of shrimp in 5% MTGase with 2% NaCl for 30 minutes improved the quality as compared to control. Furthermore, these treatments increased weight gain (16%) and WHC up to 94%, lowered CL to 10% and TVC 1.78 log cycle."
"High infection rate of Zika virus in mosquitoes collected from an area of active Zika virus transmission in eastern Thailand  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases. These viruses are transmitted to humans through the bites of Aedes mosquitoes. Recently, ZIKV infection has been described as an emerging disease in Thailand and many countries, especially in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Specific drugs and vaccines against these infections are unavailable; therefore, effective disease control relies on vector control measures only. To understand the transmission cycle of these viruses and mosquito vectors, this study is designed to investigate the natural infection of ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV in field-caught mosquitoes by molecular techniques. Adults and larvae of mosquitoes were collected in and around the patients' homes in the Klaeng District, Rayong Province, Thailand. CHIKV and DENV were detected by Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR and ZIKV was detected by Hemi-nested RT-PCR. ZIKV RNA was detected in 8 (10.3%) samples (5 (6.4%) females and 2 (2.6%) males of Aedes aegypti and 1 (1.3%) female Armigeres subalbatus) and CHIKV RNA in 5 (6.4%) (3 (3.8%) females and 2 (2.6%) larvae of Ae. aegypti), while DENV RNA was not detected in any samples. The Maximum Likelihood tree of nucleotide sequences of positive samples showed that ZIKV in mosquitoes were cladded within the Asian lineage. This study was a preliminary survey of the potential vectors of ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV in an affected area. Information obtained from this study helps to understand the natural infection rates in mosquitoes with ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV and may be valuable in creating the most effective mosquito vector control strategies in the future."
"Antimicrobial and weed inhibitory activities of Senna spectabilis extracts against plant pathogens  2018 International Journal of Agricultural Technology.All rights reserved.Senna spectabilis or Cassia spectabilis belongs to Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae is widely grown as an ornamental plant in Thailand. Antifungal and antibacterial of plant disease and herbicidal activities of S. spectabilis crude extracts were studied. The flowers and leaves extracts of S. spectabilis displayed low to moderate inhibit Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Fusarium oxysporum (1.85-44.44%) at 1,000 ppm. The flowers extracts from dichloromethane was showed the highest against Rhizoctonia solani (47.04%). However, these extracts could not inhibit the mycelial growth of Phythophora parasitica. Moreover, methanol stem extract inhibited Erwinia chrysanthemi and Xanthomonas axonopodis at 16.00±1.20 and 25.00±5.00 mm at 010111 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, the methanol extract from leaves and dichloromethane extract from flower of S. spectabilis at 100000 ppm were completely inhibited the germination, the growth of shoots and roots of Swollen finger grass (Chloris barbata) and followed by methanol extracts of flower and stem with 95.50% germination inhibitory. While the seed germination of Chinese Cabbage-PAI TSAI (Brassica chinensis Jusl var. parachinensis (Bailey) Tsen & Lee) was inhibited by dichloromethane flower extract at 71.38%. Moreover, the growth of Chinese Cabbage-PAI TSAI was completely inhibited by methanol leaves and flower extracts from this plant. This research was demonstrated the potential of S. spectabilis to inhibit plant pathogens, weed germination and growth. These extracts should be applying to agriculture to control weed and microbial plant pathogens for reduce chemical use and non-toxic to the environment."

If E ⊆ ℝ n is closed and the structure (ℝ, +, ·,E) is d-minimal (that is, in every structure elementarily equivalent to (ℝ, +, ·,E), every unary definable set is a disjoint union of open intervals and finitely many discrete sets), then for each p ∈ ℕ, there exist C p functions f: ℝ n → ℝ definable in (ℝ, +, ·,E) such that E is the zero set of f."
"Current progress in production of flavonoids using systems and synthetic biology platforms  2018 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All Rights Reserved.Flavonoid is an industrially-important compound due to its high pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical values. However, conventional methods in extracting and synthesizing flavonoids are costly, laborious and not sustainable due to small amount of natural flavonoids, large amounts of chemicals and space used. Biotechnological production of flavonoids represents a viable and sustainable route especially through the use of metabolic engineering strategies in microbial production hosts. In this review, we will highlight recent strategies for the improving the production of flavonoids using synthetic biology approaches in particular the innovative strategies of genetically-encoded biosensors for in vivo metabolite analysis and high-throughput screening methods using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Implementation of transcription factor based-biosensor for microbial flavonoid production and integration of systems and synthetic biology approaches for natural product development will also be discussed."
"Mucuna pruriens seed extract promotes neurite outgrowth via ten-4 dependent and independent mechanisms in Neuro2a cells  2018 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All Rights Reserved.Neurological diseases are one of the serious health hazards faced by mankind for decades. Neurite outgrowth is a key factor responsible for proper neuronal development. Any misplacement in the process could lead to neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Treatment with the available synthetic drugs imparts many difficulties to the patients due to the side effects. Compounds from natural sources can be considered as an effective replacement for this. Mucuna pruriens, used in traditional ayurvedic medicine, contains L-3,4-dihydroxy phenylalanine (L-DOPA) in its seeds, which possesses medicinal effects against neurological diseases. In this regard, seed extracts of M. pruriens originated from Thailand and India, were analyzed for their neuroprotective effects in Neuro2a cells. Hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts were found to be non-toxic to the viability of the cells. Ethanol extracts of M. pruriens of Thai origin (MTE), hexane extracts of M. pruriens of Indian origin (MIH) and ethyl acetate extracts of M. pruriens of Indian origin (MIEA) were able to induce neurite outgrowth in Neuro2a cells. Interestingly, both MTE and MIH induced neurite outgrowth dependent on Teneurin-4 (Ten-4) transmembrane protein whereas MIEA did the same independent of Ten-4, which was confirmed by real time PCR and gene silencing approach. The present study suggested that M. pruriens can be used as a potential drug in the treatment of neurological diseases as it can induce neurite outgrowth by multiple mechanisms, which will be of great use in the field of medicine."

"Effect of emg biofeedback to improve hand function in children with cerebral palsy: A randomized controlled trial  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved. Background: Cerebral palsy has pathology in immature brain problem; ischemic brain, hypoxic brain. The cause of pathology can be prenatal, perinatal and postnatal. Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback is muscles training by using electrical stimulation modality to train specific weakness muscles or pathologic side. Feedback response to the patients by visual or evidence supporting sound can make the patients to train themselves specifically. However, there is only few evidences supporting efficacy of EMG biofeedback to train muscles in cerebral palsy. Objective: To study the effect of EMG biofeedback on upper extremity to improve hand function in children with cerebral palsy. Materials and Methods: Forty children with cerebral palsy who had impairment of upper extremity and hand function. They were randomly assigned into two groups. The biofeedback group consisted of 20 patients, each received EMG biofeedback training of 3 muscles for 30 minutes plus three-task training for 30 minutes. The conventional group consisted of 20 patients, each received three-task training for 60 minutes. Upper extremity and hand function were evaluated before starting training, at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Results: The biofeedback group displayed statistically significant improvement regarding 3 subtest of Jebsen hand function test (JHFT) (p=0.004, 0.017, 0.004), respectively. Comparing with before starting training, mean decreasing of time spending at 4 th week were 15.03±4.01, 232.42±74.52 and 14.24±3.80, and at 8 th week were 13.32±2.70, 251.85±80.25 and 10.34±3.28. There were significant improvement in almost all aspect of range of motion (ROM) of elbow and wrist joints (p<0.05) and modified tardieu scale (MTS) of elbow flexors and wrist flexors (p<0.005). Conventional group displayed statistically significant improvement regarding 1 subtest of JHFT (p=0.006). Comparing with before starting training, mean decreasing of time spending at 4 th week were 174.90±49.20. Biofeedback group showed statistically significant progress over conventional group in 1 subtest of JHFT (p=0.002, 0.005), MTS of elbow flexors (p<0.001, 0.007) and ROM of elbow extension (p=0.018). Conclusion: The effect of EMG biofeedback on upper extremity and hand function in children with cerebral palsy especially in large muscle trained by EMG biofeedback is superior to conventional therapy."

"Mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter pittii and Acinetobacter nosocomialis isolates from Thailand  2018 The Authors. Purpose. The emergence of carbapenem resistance in non-baumannii Acinetobacter has increased in clinical settings worldwide. We investigated the prevalence and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in A. pittii and A. nosocomialis Thai isolates. Methodology. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (Acb) complex isolates were identified by gyrB mulitplex PCR. Carbapenem susceptibilities were studied by the agar dilution method and carbapenemase genes were detected by multiplex PCR. Reductions of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Overexpressions of efflux pumps were detected by using efflux pump inhibitors and RT-PCR. Results. Of the 346 Acb isolates, 22 and 19 were A. pittii and A. nosocomialis, respectively. The carbapenem resistance rates were 22.7% in A. pittii and 26.3% in A. nosocomialis. Three carbapenem-resistant A. pittii carried bla OXA-23 . One carbapenemresistant A. pittii harboured blaOXA-58, while another isolate co-harboured blaOXA-58 and blaIMP-14a. bla OXA-58 was also found in three carbapenem-susceptible A. pittii. Five carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis carried bla OXA-23 . Eighteen A. pittii isolates carried bla OXA-213-like . Reduced OMPs were found in carbapenem-resistant and -susceptible A. pittii carrying blaOXA-58, but were not detected in carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis isolates. Overexpression of adeE was found in carbapenemresistant A. pittii. No efflux pump genes were present in carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis. Conclusion. The major mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in A. pittii and A. nosocomialis were the production of OXA-23 and OXA-58. Overexpression of adeE played a role in carbapenem resistance in A. pittii. Since blaOXA-58 was found in carbapenem-susceptible A. pittii, using carbapenems in the treatment of A. pittii infection should be considered."
"Domain rearrangement and denaturation in Ebola virus protein VP40  2018 Author(s).The VP40 protein plays a critical role in coordinating the virion assembly, budding, and replication of the Ebola virus. Efforts have been made in recent years to understand various aspects of VP40 structure, dynamics, and function such as assembly of the protein and its roles in virus replication and penetration of the protein into the plasma membrane. A major conformational transformation is necessary for VP40 to form some of its oligomeric structures and to perform various functions. This conformational change from a compact structure with the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) closely associated involves a dissociation or springing-out of the CTD from the NTD. We perform investigations using computational molecular dynamics simulations as well as knowledge-based Monte Carlo simulations. We find that a sharp springing of the CTD from the NTD in a free VP40 protein cannot occur solely by random thermal fluctuations without intermediate oligomerized segments, and therefore is likely triggered by additional molecular events."

"Determining the amphipol distribution within membrane-protein fibre samples using small-angle neutron scattering  Arunmanee et al. 2018Detergent micelles can solubilize membrane proteins, but there is always a need for a pool of free detergent at the critical micellar concentration to maintain the micelle–monomer equilibrium. Amphipol polymeric surfactants (APols) have been developed to replace conventional detergents in membrane-protein studies, but the role of free amphipol is unclear. It has previously been shown that the removal of free APol causes monodisperse outer membrane protein F (OmpF) to form long filaments. However, any remaining APol could not be resolved using electron microscopy. Here, small-angle neutron scattering with isotope contrast matching was used to separately determine the distributions of membrane protein and amphipol in a mixed sample. The data showed that after existing free amphipol had been removed from monodisperse complexes, a new equilibrium was established between protein–amphipol filaments and a pool of newly liberated free amphipol. The filaments consisted of OmpF proteins surrounded by a belt of Apol, whilst free oblate spheroid micelles of Apol were also present. No indications of long-range order were observed, suggesting a lack of defined structure in the filaments."
"Angular analysis of the decay B+ →k+μ+μ- in proton-proton collisions at s =8 TeV  2018 CERN.The angular distribution of the flavor-changing neutral current decay B+→K+μ+μ- is studied in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.5 fb-1. The forward-backward asymmetry AFB of the dimuon system and the contribution FH from the pseudoscalar, scalar, and tensor amplitudes to the decay width are measured as a function of the dimuon mass squared. The measurements are consistent with the standard model expectations."
"Search for pair-produced resonances decaying to quark pairs in proton-proton collisions at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN.A general search for the pair production of resonances, each decaying to two quarks, is reported. The search is conducted separately for heavier resonances (masses above 400 GeV), where each of the four final-state quarks generates a hadronic jet resulting in a four-jet signature, and for lighter resonances (masses between 80 and 400 GeV), where the pair of quarks from each resonance is collimated and reconstructed as a single jet resulting in a two-jet signature. In addition, a b-tagged selection is applied to target resonances with a bottom quark in the final state. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1, from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The mass spectra are analyzed for the presence of new resonances, and are found to be consistent with standard model expectations. The results are interpreted in the framework of R-parity-violating supersymmetry assuming the pair production of scalar top quarks decaying via the hadronic coupling λ312′′ or λ323′′ and upper limits on the cross section as a function of the top squark mass are set. These results probe a wider range of masses than previously explored at the LHC, and extend the top squark mass limits in the t→qq′ scenario."
"Long-term effectiveness of omalizumab treatment in Thai severe asthmatic patients: A real-life experience BACKGROUND: To evaluate long-term effectiveness of omalizumab in 'real-life' setting of Thai asthmatic patients. METHODS: We conducted multi-center, observational study in severe asthma patients who received omalizumab in Thailand. Outcomes were asthma exacerbation (hospitalization and ER visit), asthma control test (ACT), and daily ICS dose. Data were evaluated at baseline, 16 Week, and 52 Week. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients received omalizumab treatment (average duration 16.9 months with range 16 weeks-2 years). The mean annualized rate of exacerbations was reduced from baseline (3.79) at Week 16 (3.54) and Week 52 (1.16), (p<0.05), respectively. The mean hospitalization rate was reduced from 0.49 in previous year to 0.15 at Week 16 and 0.19 at Week 52. A reduction in ER visit rates was observed at Week 16 (0.15) and Week 52 (0.97) respectively from baseline (1.44) (p<0.05). The ACT score increased from 15.4 at baseline to 20.6 at Week 16 (p<0.001) and increased to 21.5 at Week 52 (p<0.001). The number of patients with controlled asthma (ACT≥20) increased from 16 of 51 at baseline to 32 of 45 at Week 16 and 25 of 32 at week 52, respectively. The median daily dose of ICS equivalent to fluticasone was reduced from baseline 680 mcg to 500 mcg at Week 52. In all, 22 patients discontinued omalizumab after 1 year. Six patients who discontinued omalizumab were restarted due to relapse of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirms the effectiveness of one-year duration of omalizumab treatment in Thai severe asthmatic patients. Furthermore, 27% of patients who discontinued treatment required restarting due to relapse of symptoms."
"Randomized comparison of caregivers' ability to use epinephrine autoinjectors and prefilled syringes for anaphylaxis BACKGROUND: Caregivers often incorrectly use epinephrine autoinjectors. It is unclear whether this is due to insufficient training or a difficult-to-use tool. Furthermore, the high costs of epinephrine autoinjectors may limit their availability; so low-cost prefilled syringes may be the alternative. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized trial to compare successful epinephrine administration at four stages: after reading written instructions, and immediately after, 6 weeks, and 3 months following video training. The time required for successful epinephrine administration and failed steps in the administration of epinephrine autoinjectors and prefilled syringe were also investigated. RESULTS: Complete data analysis of 113 participants (prefilled syringe group, n=57; EpiPen, n=56) was performed. Significantly more participants correctly demonstrated the use of prefilled syringes compared to EpiPen after reading instructions, and immediately following 6 weeks, and 3 months after video training. ((adjusted OR 26.17 (95%CI 8.2583.04), adjusted OR 4.07 (95%CI 1.29-12.86), adjusted OR 14.01 (95%CI 3.62-54.22)) and adjusted OR 31.44 (95%CI 5.73172.39), respectively) Four key step errors would likely result in failure of administration and were more common with EpiPen (14.0% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in time of successful administration between the two groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Epinephrine prefilled syringe was significantly easier to use with a higher rate of correct use compared to EpiPen over time. All four key step errors in the administration were more likely with EpiPen. The time required for successful epinephrine administration was not significantly different."
"Effects of aerobic exercise and vitamin C supplementation on rhinitis symptoms in allergic rhinitis patients INTRODUCTION: Exercise training and vitamin C supplementation have both been recommended as an effective adjuvant treatment in the management of symptoms in patients with many diseases. However, its effects on rhinitis symptoms remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of exercise training alone, and in combination with vitamin C supplementation, on rhinitis symptoms in allergic rhinitis patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven rhinitis patients were randomized into 3 groups: control (CON; n = 8), exercise (EX; n = 9), and exercise combined with vitamin C (EX + Vit.C; n = 10). The exercise training protocol consisted of walking and/or running on a treadmill at 65-70% heart rate reserve for 30 min per session, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The EX + Vit.C group ingested 2,000 mg vitamin C per day. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, both EX and EX + Vit.C groups increased peak aerobic capacity and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and exhibited significantly decreased rhinitis symptoms, nasal blood flow (NBF) and malondialdehylde levels compared to pre-test. Rhinitis symptoms and NBF after nasal challenge with house dust mite decreased significantly in the EX and EX + Vit.C groups. The EX and EX + Vit.C groups had significantly lower nasal secretion interleukin (IL)-4, but higher nasal secretion IL-2 levels, than the CON group. CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly confirms that aerobic exercise training significantly improved clinical of allergic rhinitis and cytokine profiles. Nonetheless, with the limited power of small sample size, whether adding vitamin C is any beneficial is not shown. A larger randomized controlled trial is thus warranted."
"First episode of preschool wheeze requiring hospitalization:a prospective study on the chance of recurrence and associated factors BACKGROUND: Although wheezing is very common in preschoolers, epidemiologic studies in Thailand are quite limited. The likelihood of having a second wheezing episode following the first attack remains unclearly established. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the incidence of recurrent wheezing in preschool children presenting with first wheezing episode and identify the associated factors. METHODS: The study is an observational prospective study conducted at the inpatient pediatric department. Patients admitted with first episode of wheezing were followed up as an outpatient approximately one week after hospital discharge and subsequently followed up by telephone 3-monthly with a structured questionnaire seeking information concerning recurrent wheezing, defined as having a second wheezing episode requiring bronchodilator within a 1-year period. RESULTS: The total of 97 patients, aged 6 months to 5 years, were recruited from June 2014 to November 2015. Thirty-five patients were excluded because of inaccessibility for telephone follow-up. Amongst the remaining 62 patients, twenty-eight (45.2%) had recurrent wheezing within one year. The mean lapse duration was 4.7 ± 3.7 months after the first episode. Having an allergic sensitization to aeroallergen was a risk factor for recurrent wheezing (OR 2.48, 95%CI 1.81-3.4). Although not statistically significant, having an allergic sensitization to food seems to be another related factor (OR 2.36, 95%CI 1.75-3.18). CONCLUSION: The recurrent rate of wheezing was 45%, which was considerably significant. Allergic sensitization to aeroallergen might increase the risk. These patients should be followed up, especially within the first year after their first wheezing episode."
"Differential dendritic cell responses to cell wall mannan of Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida dubliniensis  2018, Nihon University, School of Dentistry. All rights reserved.Mannan (mannosylated glycoproteins) in the outermost layer of the Candida cell wall may be the first molecules that interact with host dendritic cells (DCs) and activate immune responses that determine disease outcomes. However, little is known about how different mannan structures of common oral Candida species affect DC activation. The effects of heat-inactivated (HI) yeast cells and soluble mannan of Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida dubliniensis on bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) responses were compared. HI Candida and the mannan exhibited different effects on BMDC activation and functions, which could be due to other carbohydrate compositions in the yeast cell wall. Among Candida mannan, the C. albicans mannan was the weakest stimulus and induced only interferon (IFN)-γ production. This suggests the possibility that C. albicans mannan may skew T helper (Th) responses from protective Th17 toward Th1. In contrast, C. parapsilosis mannan caused strong BMDC activation and high production of several proinflammatory cytokines which possibly promote hyperinflammation. Meanwhile, C. dubliniensis mannan induced moderate BMDC responses, which may correlate with its lower pathogenicity. Therefore, mannan of each Candida species play distinct roles in DC responses and may be involved in the immunopathogenesis and disease severity of oral candidiasis as well as other Candida infection."
"Common viral infections in kidney transplant recipients  2018 by The Korean Society of Nephrology.Infectious complications have been considered as a major cause of morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation, especially in the Asian population. Therefore, prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment of such infections are crucial in kidney transplant recipients. Among all infectious complications, viruses are considered to be the most common agents because of their abundance, infectivity, and latency ability. Herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, BK polyomavirus, and adenovirus are well-known etiologic agents of viral infections in kidney transplant patients worldwide because of their wide range of distribution. As DNA viruses, they are able to reactivate after affected patients receive immunosuppressive agents. These DNA viruses can cause systemic diseases or allograft dysfunction, especially in the first six months after transplantation. Pretransplant evaluation and immunization as well as appropriate prophylaxis and preemptive approaches after transplant have been established in the guidelines and are used effectively to reduce the incidence of these viral infections. This review will describe the etiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral infections that commonly affect kidney transplant recipients."
"Event shape variables measured using multijet final states in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).The study of global event shape variables can provide sensitive tests of predictions for multijet production in proton-proton collisions. This paper presents a study of several event shape variables calculated using jet four momenta in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and uses data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb−1. After correcting for detector effects, the resulting distributions are compared with several theoretical predictions. The agreement generally improves as the energy, represented by the average transverse momentum of the two leading jets, increases.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"A nonrelativistic limit for AdS perturbations  2018, The Author(s).The familiar c → ∞ nonrelativistic limit converts the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime to the free Schrödinger equation, and the Einstein-massive-scalar system without a cosmological constant to the Schrödinger-Newton (SN) equation. In this paper, motivated by the problem of stability of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, we examine how this limit is affected by the presence of a negative cosmological constant Λ. Assuming for consistency that the product Λc2 tends to a negative constant as c → ∞, we show that the corresponding nonrelativistic limit is given by the SN system with an external harmonic potential which we call the Schrödinger-Newton-Hooke (SNH) system. We then derive the resonant approximation which captures the dynamics of small amplitude spherically symmetric solutions of the SNH system. This resonant system turns out to be much simpler than its general-relativistic version, which makes it amenable to analytic methods. Specifically, in four spatial dimensions, we show that the resonant system possesses a three-dimensional invariant subspace on which the dynamics is completely integrable and hence can be solved exactly. The evolution of the two-lowest-mode initial data (an extensively studied case for the original general-relativistic system), in particular, is described by this family of solutions."
"Melittin induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in Chago-K1 human bronchogenic carcinoma cells and inhibited the differentiation of THP-1 cells into tumour- associated macrophages  2018, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.Background: Bronchogenic carcinoma (lung cancer) is one of the leading causes of death. Although many compounds isolated from natural products have been used to treat it, drug resistance is a serious problem, and alternative anti-cancer drugs are required. Here, melittin from Apis mellifera venom was used, and its effects on bronchogenic carcinoma cell proliferation and tumour-associated macrophage differentiation were evaluated. Methods: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of melittin was measured by MTT. Cell death was observed by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) co-staining followed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle arrest was revealed by PI staining and flow cytometry. To investigate the tumour microenvironment, differentiation of circulating monocytes (THP-1) into tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) was assayed by sandwich-ELISA and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were determined. Cell proliferation and migration was observed by flat plate colony formation. Secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by ELISA. The change in expression levels of CatS, Bcl-2, and MADD was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Melittin was significantly more cytotoxic (p < 0.01) to human bronchogenic carcinoma cells (ChaGo-K1) than to the control human lung fibroblasts (Wi-38) cells. At 2.5 μM, melittin caused ChaGo-K1 cells to undergo apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The IL-10 levels showed that melittin significantly inhibited the differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs (p < 0.05) and reduced the number of colonies formed in the treated ChaGo-K1 cells compared to the untreated cells. However, melittin did not affect angiogenesis in ChaGo-K1 cells. Unlike MADD, Bcl-2 was up-regulated significantly (p < 0.05) in melittin-treated ChaGo-K1 cells. Conclusion: Melittin can be used as an alternative agent for lung cancer treatment because of its cytotoxicity against ChaGo-K1 cells and the inhibition of differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs."
"Alteration of urinary neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin as a predictor of tacrolimus-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis in tacrolimus dose adjustments following kidney transplantation  2018 Chancharoenthana et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Despite tacrolimus (TAC) drug-level monitoring, TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis remains an important problem. This study investigated the potential of urinary neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (uNGAL) as a chronic renal allograft fibrosis biomarker in a two-phase study (proof of concept and cohort). In the proof of concept stage of the study, increased TAC-doses at 3 days after dose adjustment compared with the baseline were associated with elevated uNGAL (+ΔuNGAL) and urinary interleukin 18 (IL-18), but normal serum creatinine (SCr), despite the therapeutic trough levels of TAC. In the cohort study, the patients with elevated uNGAL post-recruitment in comparison with the baseline (+ΔuNGAL) was associated with the more severe renal allograft fibrosis from renal pathology of the protocol biopsy at 12 months post kidney transplantation (post-KT). A cut-off value of uNGAL 125.2 ng/mL during a 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-KT was associated with a higher fibrosis score, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.88, p < 0.0001) and a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.54 (95% CI 1.45 to 9.33; p < 0.001). We conclude that uNGAL is a sensitive biomarker of TAC induced subtle renal injury and TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis. We propose that uNGAL measurements, in addition to trough levels of TAC, should be used to predict TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis in the recipients of KT."
"The utilization of the surviving sepsis campaign care bundles in the treatment of pediatric patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in a resource-limited environment: A prospective multicenter trial  2018 Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.Background: Sepsis is a common condition affecting the lives of infants and children worldwide. Although implementation of the surviving sepsis campaign (SSC) care bundles was once believed to be effective in reducing sepsis mortality rates, the approach has recently been questioned. Methods: The study was a prospective, interventional, multicenter trial. Infants and children aged 1 month to 15 years in seven different large academic centers in Thailand who had been diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. They were given treatment based on the SSC care bundles. Results: A total of 519 children with severe sepsis or septic shock were enrolled in the study. Among these, 188 were assigned to the intervention group and 331 were recruited to the historical case-control group. There were no significant differences in the baseline clinical characteristics. The intervention group was administered a significantly higher fluid bolus than was the control group (28.3 ± 17.2 cc/kg vs. 17.7 ± 10.6 cc/kg; P = 0.02) with early vasopressor used (1.5 ± 0.7 h) compared to control group (7.4 ± 2.4 h, P < 0.05). More importantly, our sepsis mortality reduced significantly from 37% ± 20.7% during the preintervention period to 19.4% ± 14.3% during the postintervention period (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated a significant reduction in sepsis mortality after the implementation of the SSC care bundles. Early diagnosis of the disease, optimum hemodynamic resuscitation, and timely antibiotic administration are the key elements of sepsis management."
"Real-life clinical pattern, management, and survival in Thai patients with early-stage or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer  2018 Srimuninnimit et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Objectives To characterize the clinical pattern and evaluate real-life practices in the management of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in Thailand. Methods In this multicenter, prospective, observational cohort, females (aged 18 years) with histologically and immunohistochemically confirmed TNBC were enrolled. Patient data was collected at four study visits–an inclusion visit (for enrollment), and three subsequent follow-up visits at 12±1, 24±1, and 36±1 months after completion of first day of any planned chemotherapy. Results Of the 293 enrolled patients, 262 (89.4%) had early-stage TNBC (Stage I: 46 patients, Stage II: 151 patients, and Stage III: 65 patients) and 31 (10.6%) had metastatic TNBC (mTNBC). Chemotherapy was prescribed to 95.4% of the early-stage patients and to 100.0% of the mTNBC patients; most commonly as anthracycline-based in combination with cyclophosphamide and other agents. Patients’ performance status and consensus guidelines were the major factors affecting choice of treatment. In early-stage patients, median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) had not been reached for Stage I and II patients, and were calculated to be 37.0 months and 40.0 months, respectively, in Stage III patients. In mTNBC patients, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were found to be 10.0 months and 14.0 months, respectively. In Stage III patients, anthracycline-based regimens were found to be associated with increase in DFS (p = 0.0181) and OS (p = 0.0027) compared to non-anthracycline-based regimens. In mTNBC patients, non-taxane-based regimens were associated with an increase in PFS (p = 0.0025). The 3-year survival rates in early-stage and mTNBC patients were 85.0% and 21.0%, respectively. Conclusion Clinical management of TNBC in Thailand follows the general guidelines for treatment of TNBC. However, prognosis and survival outcomes are suboptimal, especially in progressive disease. This study is the first assessment in the existing practices in which the results could pave to way to improve the treatment outcome of TNBC in Thailand."
"A robust intracellular metabolite extraction protocol for human neutrophil metabolic profiling Copyright:  2018 Chokesuwattanaskul et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Neutrophils are phagocytic innate immune cells that play essential roles in host defence, but are also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they contribute to systemic inflammation and joint damage. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur as a consequence of this activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the study of changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Sample preparation and spectral analysis protocols were optimised using neutrophils isolated by Ficoll-Paque, with decreased washing steps and inclusion of a heat-shock step to quench metabolite turnover. Cells were incubated ± PMA for 15 min in HEPES-free media and samples were analysed by NMR using a 700 MHz NMR Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software were used to process spectra and identify metabolites. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and signalling pathway analysis was carried out using Metaboanalyst. Cell number and number of scans (NS) were optimised as >3.6 million cells and 512 NS. 327 spectral bins were defined in the neutrophil spectra, of which 287 (87.7%) were assigned to 110 metabolites that included: amino acids, peptides and analogues; carbohydrates, carbonyls and alcohols; nucleotides, nucleosides and analogues; lipids and lipid-like molecules; benzenoids; and other organic compounds. 43 metabolites changed at least 1.5 fold (increase or decrease) after the addition of PMA for 5 or 15 min. Pathway analysis revealed that PMA affected nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and glycolysis, suggesting a redirection of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway and production of NADPH for activation of the NADPH oxidase and subsequent respiratory burst. We have developed protocols for the study of human neutrophils by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, this methodology has sufficient sensitivity and reproducibility to detect changes in metabolite abundance from cell numbers typically collected from clinical samples or experiments with multiple assay conditions."
"Role of mucoprotective agents in endoscopic submucosal dissection-derived ulcers: A systematic review  2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Background: Currently, it is still unclear whether adding a mucoprotective agent to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) results in better outcomes compared with using a PPI alone in patients with post-gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) ulcers. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of PPI alone versus combination treatment in healing of post-gastric ESD ulcers, as well as on delayed bleeding and amount of blood transfused. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ISI Web of knowledge databases, up until May 2017, for randomized trials comparing PPI alone versus PPI plus a mucoprotective drug in achieving ulcer healing in patients undergoing gastric ESD was performed. The primary outcome is scarring stage on endoscopic assessment at 4 or 8 weeks after gastric ESD. Results: From an initial 3071 citations, eight articles (n = 953 lesions from 934 patients) were analyzed. Patients receiving combination treatment achieved a scarring stage significantly more often than those on a PPIs alone at 4 or 8 weeks after ESD, (risk ratio = 1.36, 95% CI; 1.06–1.75). No study reported amount of blood transfused. There were no significant between treatment-group differences in terms of delayed bleeding (risk ratio = 0.58, 95% CI; 0.17–1.99). Neither location of ulcer nor Helicobacter pylori infection was related to ulcer scarring stage. Conclusion: The limited evidences suggested combination treatment may be more effective in accelerating the process of ulcer healing in patients undergoing gastric ESD than the use of PPI alone, but does not appear to alter delayed bleeding risk."
"GOODS-ALMA: 1.1 mm galaxy survey: I. Source catalog and optically dark galaxies  ESO 2018. Aims. We present a 69 arcmin 2 ALMA survey at 1.1 mm, GOODS-ALMA, matching the deepest HST-WFC3 H-band part of the GOODS-South field. Methods. We tapered the 0″24 original image with a homogeneous and circular synthesized beam of 0″60 to reduce the number of independent beams - thus reducing the number of purely statistical spurious detections - and optimize the sensitivity to point sources. We extracted a catalog of galaxies purely selected by ALMA and identified sources with and without HST counterparts down to a 5σ limiting depth of H=28.2 AB (HST/WFC3 F160W). Results. ALMA detects 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy at 1.1 mm in the 0″60 tapered mosaic (rms sensitivity σ ≃ 0.18 mJy beam -1 ) with a purity greater than 80%. Among these detections, we identify three sources with no HST nor Spitzer-IRAC counterpart, consistent with the expected number of spurious galaxies from the analysis of the inverted image; their definitive status will require additional investigation. We detect additional three sources with HST counterparts either at high significance in the higher resolution map, or with different detection-algorithm parameters ensuring a purity greater than 80%. Hence we identify in total 20 robust detections. Conclusions. Our wide contiguous survey allows us to push further in redshift the blind detection of massive galaxies with ALMA with a median redshift of z=2.92 and a median stellar mass of M ∗ =1.1 × 10 11 M ⊙ . Our sample includes 20% HST-dark galaxies (4 out of 20), all detected in the mid-infrared with Spitzer-IRAC. The near-infrared based photometric redshifts of two of them (z∼4.3 and 4.8) suggest that these sources have redshifts z> 4. At least 40% of the ALMA sources host an X-ray AGN, compared to ∼14% for other galaxies of similar mass and redshift. The wide area of our ALMA survey provides lower values at the bright end of number counts than single-dish telescopes affected by confusion."
"Complete genome analysis demonstrates multiple introductions of enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 recombinant strains into Thailand during the past decade  2018, The Author(s).Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) caused by enteroviruses remains a public health threat, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region during the past two decades. Moreover, the introduction of multiple subgenotypes and the emergence of recombinant viruses is of epidemiological importance. Based on either the full genome or VP1 sequences, 32 enteroviruses (30 from HFMD patients, 1 from an encephalitic patient, and 1 from an asymptomatic contact case) isolated in Thailand between 2006 and 2014 were identified as 25 enterovirus 71 (EV71) isolates (comprising 20 B5, 1 C2, 2 C4a, and 2 C4b subgenotypes) and 7 coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) isolates (comprising 6 B1a and 1 B1b subgenotypes). The EV71 subgenotype C4b was introduced into Thailand for the first time in 2006 and was replaced by subgenotype C4a strains in 2009. Phylogenetic, similarity plot and bootscan analyses of the complete viral genomes identified 12 recombinant viruses among the 32 viral isolates. Only one EV71-B5 isolate out of 20 was a recombinant virus with one region of intratypic or intertypic recombination, while all four EV71-C4 isolates were recombinant viruses having undergone double recombination, and all seven CA16 isolates were recombinant viruses. The recombination breakpoints of these recombinants are located solely within the P2 and P3 regions. Surveillance for circulating strains and subgenotype replacement are important with respect to molecular epidemiology and the selection of the upcoming EV71 vaccine. In addition, the clinical importance of recombinant viruses needs to be further explored."
"Two-state co-expression network analysis to identify genes related to salt tolerance in Thai rice  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML105) rice is one of the most important crops of Thailand. It is a challenging task to identify the genes responding to salinity in KDML105 rice. The analysis of the gene co-expression network has been widely performed to prioritize significant genes, in order to select the key genes in a specific condition. In this work, we analyzed the two-state co-expression networks of KDML105 rice under salt-stress and normal grown conditions. The clustering coefficient was applied to both networks and exhibited significantly different structures between the salt-stress state network and the original (normal-grown) network. With higher clustering coefficients, the genes that responded to the salt stress formed a dense cluster. To prioritize and select the genes responding to the salinity, we investigated genes with small partners under normal conditions that were highly expressed and were co-working with many more partners under salt-stress conditions. The results showed that the genes responding to the abiotic stimulus and relating to the generation of the precursor metabolites and energy were the great candidates, as salt tolerant marker genes. In conclusion, in the case of the complexity of the environmental conditions, gaining more information in order to deal with the co-expression network provides better candidates for further analysis."
"The [CII] emission as a molecular gas mass tracer in galaxies at low and high redshifts  2018 The Author(s).We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the [CII]158 μm emission for a sample of 10 mainsequence galaxies at redshift z ~ 2, with typical stellar masses (logM*/M⊙ ~ 10.0-10.9) and star formation rates (~35-115 M⊙ yr-1). Given the strong and well-understood evolution of the interstellar medium from the present to z = 2, we investigate the behaviour of the [CII] emission and empirically identify its primary driver. We detect [C II] from six galaxies (four secure and two tentative) and estimate ensemble averages including non-detections. The [C II]- to-infrared luminosity ratio (L[C II]/LIR) of our sample is similar to that of local main-sequence galaxies (~2 × 10-3), and ~10 times higher than that of starbursts. The [CII] emission has an average spatial extent of 4-7 kpc, consistent with the optical size. Complementing our sample with literature data, we find that the [CII] luminosity correlates with galaxies' molecular gas mass, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.2 dex and without evident systematics: the [CII]- to-H2 conversion factor (α[C II] ~ 30 M⊙/L⊙) is largely independent of galaxies' depletion time, metallicity, and redshift. [C II] seems therefore a convenient tracer to estimate galaxies' molecular gas content regardless of their starburst or main-sequence nature, and extending to metal-poor galaxies at low and high redshifts. The dearth of [C II] emission reported for z > 6-7 galaxies might suggest either a high star formation efficiency or a small fraction of ultraviolet light from star formation reprocessed by dust."
"Rice overexpressing OsNUC1-s reveals differential gene expression leading to yield loss reduction after salt stress at the booting stage  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Rice nucleolin (OsNUC1), consisting of two isoforms, OsNUC1-L and OsNUC1-S, is a multifunctional protein involved in salt-stress tolerance. Here, OsNUC1-S’s function was investigated using transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsNUC1-S. Under non-stress conditions, the transgenic lines showed a lower yield, but higher net photosynthesis rates, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates than wild type only in the second leaves, while in the flag leaves, these parameters were similar among the lines. However, under salt-stress conditions at the booting stage, the higher yields in transgenic lines were detected. Moreover, the gas exchange parameters of the transgenic lines were higher in both flag and second leaves, suggesting a role for OsNUC1-S overexpression in photosynthesis adaptation under salt-stress conditions. Moreover, the overexpression lines could maintain light-saturation points under salt-stress conditions, while a decrease in the light-saturation point owing to salt stress was found in wild type. Based on a transcriptome comparison between wild type and a transgenic line, after 3 and 9 days of salt stress, the significantly differentially expressed genes were enriched in the metabolic process of nucleic acid and macromolecule, photosynthesis, water transport, and cellular homeostasis processes, leading to the better performance of photosynthetic processes under salt-stress conditions at the booting stage."
"How might normative and mimetic pressures improve local government service performance reporting?  2016 AFAANZIncreasingly, public sector organisations are being encouraged or required to provide service performance information in addition to financial statements. Yet, reporting is often inferior, as shown by this example of local governments in New Zealand. Poor quality reporting has led to different initiatives to improve service performance reporting quality, and this study investigates the effectiveness of three initiatives undertaken by the Auditor-General. Drawing on contemporary institutional and legitimacy theories, we find that normative pressure in tandem with threats to legitimacy is influential in improving service performance reporting. However, despite mimetic examples also being used, the analysis shows it is an ineffective tool in the New Zealand local government context."
"Genetic diversity and relationships among Lyle's flying fox colonies in Thailand  2018 Kasetsart UniversityLyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei) is a large frugivorous bat found in central Thailand that usually roosts in temples in the middle of towns in close proximity to humans. Pteropus lylei is considered a reservoir for Nipah encephalitis viral outbreaks reported in Malaysia and Bangladesh. Thailand is bordered to the south by Malaysia. Information on the genetic diversity and genetic relationships of P. lylei is limited; therefore, cytochrome b (cytb) DNA sequences were used to examine the genetic diversity and genetic relationships of P. lylei. In total, 52 P. lylei individuals from 10 colonies in central Thailand were analyzed. The study identified 25 unique haplotypes and 43 variable sites among the 52 individuals. The results showed that P. lylei had high levels of haplotype diversity (0.949, 25 different haplotypes among 52 individuals) but low levels of nucleotide diversity (0.006). The overall pairwise φST was 0.006 (p < 0.05). The results indicated that high levels of gene flow occurred among P. lylei colonies distributed across central Thailand. The sequence data suggested that the overall P. lylei population has high levels of haplotype diversity, which may reflect genetic exchange during P. lylei movement. These results will help manage populations and assess the risk of outbreaks of the encephalitis (Nipah) virus carried by Lyle's flying fox."
"Improving Thai word and sentence segmentation using linguistic knowledge Copyright  2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication EngineersWord boundary ambiguity in word segmentation has long been a fundamental challenge within Thai language processing. The Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is among the best-known methods to have achieved remarkably accurate segmentation. Nevertheless, current advancements appear to have left the problem of compound words unaccounted for. Compound words lose their meaning or context once segmented. Hence, we introduce a dictionary-based word-merging algorithm, which merges all kinds of compound words. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm can accomplish a high-accuracy of word segmentation, with compound words being preserved. Moreover, it can also restore some incorrectly segmented words. Another problem involving a different word-chunking approach is sentence boundary ambiguity. In tackling the problem, utilizing the part of speech (POS) of a segmented word has been found previously to help boost the accuracy of CRF-based sentence segmentation. However, not all segmented words can be tagged. Thus, we propose a POS-based word-splitting algorithm, which splits words in order to increase POS tags. We found that with more identifiable POS tags, the CRF model performs better in segmenting sentences. To demonstrate the contributions of both methods, we experimented with three of their applications. With the word merging algorithm, we found that intact compound words in the product of topic extraction can help to preserve their intended meanings, offering more precise information for human interpretation. The algorithm, together with the POS-based word-splitting algorithm, can also be used to amend word-level Thai-English translations. In addition, the word-splitting algorithm improves sentence segmentation, thus enhancing text summarization."
"Baseline atrial fibrillation is associated with contrast-induced nephropathy after cardiac catheterization in coronary artery disease: Systemic review and meta-analysis  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, independently associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Recent studies suggest that AF is potentially associated with contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing catheterization. However, the association was not conclusive. Thus, we assessed the association between AF in patients with CAD and CIN by a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. Hypothesis: AF is a predictor of CIN in patients with CAD. Methods: We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to April 2018. Included studies were published observational studies that compared the risk of CIN among CAD patients with AF vs those without AF. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Eight cohort studies from June 2007 to November 2017 were included in this meta-analysis involving 16,691 subjects with CAD (1,030 with AF and 15,661 without its presence). The presence of AF was associated with CIN (pooled risk ratio = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.50-3.14, P < 0.001, I 2 = 54.1%). In our subgroup analysis by urgency and multivariable adjustment, both groups still showed substantial association between AF and CIN (P < 0.05). Conclusions: AF increased the risk of CIN up to two fold among patients with CAD compared to the absence of it. Our study suggests that the presence of AF in CAD is prognostic for the development of CIN."
"Extraction of Trend Keywords and stop words from Thai Facebook pages using character n-Grams  2018, International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology.In the era of data and information, insight of user's behavior such as trend is normally used in real-time marketing for improvement of gross profit, therefore, it is beneficial to know the trend in social media. Word tokenization and stop words list are the conventional method for keyword extraction task, however for Thai language in social media platform, there are still no efficient word tokenization tools and stop words list to extract trend from platform such as Facebook. Therefore, in this research, we propose an algorithm that require no word tokenization tools and external stop words list for the purpose of Trend Keywords extraction. The core idea is using Character n-Grams, instead of Word n-Grams, to tokenize, process, and combine n-Grams into keyword. After that we identified Trend Keywords from other keywords by using our algorithm to generate stop words list for filtering out stop words. For the evaluation of result, we use human to classify the retrieved Trend Keywords and compare them with Trend Keywords from baseline method. As a result, our algorithm can identify more keyword than baseline method. Finally, the precision of generated stop words list is 97.6%, and the precision of Trend Keywords is 40% with the used of 1-month generated stop words list. Furthermore, by using 2-months generated stop words list, the precision can be increased to 44% by consuming more processing time for list of stop words."

"Adjunctive Use of Cidofovir and Intravenous Immunoglobulin to Treat Invasive Adenoviral Disease in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients  2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.Background: Infections with adenoviruses (ADVs) can result in considerable mortality and morbidity in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Standard therapy for ADV infections in transplant recipients is not established. At our institution, intravenous cidofovir and immunoglobulin have been used to treat disseminated or invasive ADV in SOT and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Methods: A retrospective case series of SOT recipients treated with cidofovir and intravenous immunoglobulin was performed. Results: Five SOT recipients (four renal and one heart transplant) with adenovirus infection were treated successfully with cidofovir and immunoglobulin. Cidofovir was discontinued after the first negative ADV viral load and resolution of clinical symptoms, given the concern for nephrotoxicity in renal transplant recipients. Renal tubular acidosis type 2 and iritis were observed in two patients receiving therapy. Conclusion: Symptom resolution and a single negative ADV viral load may be indicators for cidofovir discontinuation."
"Two regulators, PA3898 and PA2100, modulate the pseudomonas aeruginosa multidrug resistance MexAB-OprM and EmrAB efflux pumps and biofilm formation  2018 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.It is generally believed that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm matrix itself acts as a molecular sieve or sink that contributes to significant levels of drug resistance, but it is becoming more apparent that multidrug efflux pumps induced during biofilm growth significantly enhance resistance levels. We present here a novel transcriptional regulator, PA3898, which controls biofilm formation and multidrug efflux pumps in P. aeruginosa. A mutant of this regulator significantly reduced the ability of P. aeruginosa to produce biofilm in vitro and affected its in vivo fitness and pathogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and BALB/c mouse lung infection models. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PA3898 modulates essential virulence genes/pathways, including multidrug efflux pumps and phenazine biosynthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified its DNA binding sequences and confirmed that PA3898 directly interacts with promoter regions of four genes/operons, two of which are mexAB-oprM and phz2. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed a regulatory partner of PA3898 as PA2100, and both are required for binding to DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. PA3898 and PA2100 were given the names MdrR1 and MdrR2, respectively, as novel repressors of the mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux operon and activators for another multidrug efflux pump, EmrAB. The interaction between MdrR1 and MdrR2 at the promoter regions of their regulons was further characterized via localized surface plasmon resonance and DNA footprinting. These regulators directly repress the mexAB-oprM operon, independent of its well-established MexR regulator. Mutants of mdrR1 and mdrR2 caused increased resistance to multiple antibiotics in P. aeruginosa, validating the significance of these newly discovered regulators."
"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment in patients with stable or acute coronary heart disease in the Asia-Pacific region: results from the Dyslipidemia International Study II  The European Society of Cardiology 2018.Background: As mortality due to cardiovascular disease increases throughout the world, accurate data on risk factors such as hyperlipidemia are required. This is lacking in the Asia-Pacific region. Design: The observational Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS) II was established to quantify the extent of hyperlipidemia in adults with acute and stable coronary heart disease globally. Methods: Patients with stable coronary heart disease or hospitalised with an acute coronary syndrome were enrolled across nine Asia-Pacific countries from July 2013 to October 2014. Lipid-lowering therapy and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment (<70 mg/dL) were assessed. The acute coronary syndrome cohort was followed up 4 months post-discharge. Results: Of the 4592 patients enrolled, 2794 had stable coronary heart disease and 1798 were admitted with an acute coronary syndrome. In the coronary heart disease cohort, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 86.9 mg/dL, with 91.7% using lipid-lowering therapy and 31% achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL. In the acute coronary syndrome cohort at admission, the corresponding values were 103.2 mg/dL, 63.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Target attainment was significantly higher in lipid-lowering therapy-treated than non-treated patients in each cohort (32.6% vs. 12.9% and 31.1% vs. 9.0%, respectively). Mean atorvastatin-equivalent dosages were low (20 ± 15 and 22 ± 18 mg/day, respectively), with little use of non-statin adjuvants (13.0% and 6.8%, respectively). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment had improved by follow-up for the acute coronary syndrome patients, but remained low (41.7%). Conclusions: Many patients in Asia at very high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level above the recommended target. Although lipid-lowering therapy was common, it was not used to its full potential."

"Cell wall mannan of Candida krusei mediates dendritic cell apoptosis and orchestrates Th17 polarization via TLR-2/MyD88-dependent pathway  2018, The Author(s).Dendritic cells (DCs) abundantly express diverse receptors to recognize mannans in the outer surface of Candida cell wall, and these interactions dictate the host immune responses that determine disease outcomes. C. krusei prevalence in candidiasis worldwide has increased since this pathogen has developed multidrug resistance. However, little is known how the immune system responds to C. krusei. Particularly, the molecular mechanisms of the interplay between C. krusei mannan and DCs remain to be elucidated. We investigated how C. krusei mannan affected DC responses in comparison to C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata mannan. Our results showed that only C. krusei mannan induced massive cytokine responses in DCs, and led to apoptosis. Although C. krusei mannan-activated DCs underwent apoptosis, they were still capable of initiating Th17 response. C. krusei mannan-mediated DC apoptosis was obligated to the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway. These pathways also controlled Th1/Th17 switching possibly by virtue of the production of the polarizing cytokines IL-12 and IL-6 by the C. krusei mannan activated-DCs. Our study suggests that TLR2 and MyD88 pathway in DCs are dominant for C. krusei mannan recognition, which differs from the previous reports showing a crucial role of C-type lectin receptors in Candida mannan sensing."
"Relations between cardinalities of the finite sequences and the finite subsets of a set  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWe write seq(m) and fin(m) for the cardinalities of the set of finite sequences and the set of finite subsets, respectively, of a set which is of cardinality m. With the axiom of choice (AC), seq(m) = fin(m) for every infinite cardinal m but, without AC, any relationship between seq(m) and fin(m) for an arbitrary infinite cardinal m cannot be proved. In this paper, we give conditions that make seq(m) and fin(m) comparable for an infinite cardinal m. Among our results, we show that, if we assume the axiom of choice for sets of finite sets, then seq(m) = fin(m) for every Dedekind-infinite cardinal m and the condition that m is Dedekind-infinite cannot be weakened to weakly Dedekind-infinite."
"AFOMP policy number 6: code of ethics for medical physicists in AFOMP Countries  2018, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.This policy statement, which is the sixth of a series of documents prepared by the Asia-Oceania Federation of Organizations for Medical Physics (AFOMP) Professional Development Committee, gives guidance on how medical physicists in AFOMP countries should conduct themselves in an ethical manner in their professional practice (Ng et al. in Australas Phys Eng Sci Med 32:175–179, 2009; Round et al. in Australas Phys Eng Sci Med 33:7–10, 2010; Round et al. in Australas Phys Eng Sci Med 34:303–307, 2011; Round et al. in Australas Phys Eng Sci Med 35:393–398, 2012; Round et al. in Australas Phys Eng Sci Med 38:217–221, 2015).

"New application of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging for the assessment of deglutitive tongue movement  2018, The Author(s).Background: Deglutitive motion of the tongue may function to maintain tooth position. However, the causation between abnormal patterns of orofacial muscle function and dental malocclusion remains unclear. To clarify the pathogenic mechanism of malocclusion, it is important to determine the relative positional relationship between the tongue tip and incisor edge or the dorsal tongue and palate during deglutition. Here, we assessed the utility of 3-T segmented cine-magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, combined with static MR images for hard tissue visualization, in assessing the relationship between the tongue and the surrounding tissues during deglutitive tongue movement. Methods: Cine-MR images were acquired from three healthy female volunteers during deglutition who had no history of swallowing disorder or other chronic illness, normal alignment and occlusion, and a skeletal class I relationship. Three cine-MR images were taken during deglutition in accordance with an auditory cue for each volunteer. During static imaging, custom-made, contrast-medium-filled clear retainers were positioned in the mouth to allow visualization of the upper and lower incisors and hard palate boundaries. Static images were superimposed onto images of the three stages in deglutitive tongue movement, which were selected from a series of cine-MR images. These superimpositions were assessed five times by tracing cephalometric parameters to examine the reproducibility of the method. Results: Traces varied little across repeated measurements, and all subjects had a similar pattern of dorsal tongue movement. Tongue-to-palate contact increased slightly during the first to second stage of swallowing and abruptly increased during the second to third stage, while the tongue tip position remained constant. Conclusions: Segmented cine-MR imaging combined with static MR images is useful for assessing soft tissue motion during deglutition. This method is particularly useful in dentistry to evaluate the relationship between tongue function and maxillofacial morphology in terms of orthodontic treatment and orofacial myofunctional therapy, and for improving tongue movement during speech therapy."
"The Effect of a Brief HIV Prevention Program on Risk Reduction Behaviors Among Thai Men Diagnosed With Sexually Transmitted Infections  2018Purpose: Men diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are at greater risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and STIs reinfection. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a brief human immunodeficiency virus (B-HIV) prevention program on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) knowledge, perceived benefits of condom use, risk reduction self-efficacy, risk reduction behaviors, and reinfection rate among Thai men with STIs. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was conducted. Participants were selected from men with STI symptoms. They were randomly assigned to a B-HIV prevention program or usual care, 100 each. The program consisted of 3 modules. Key messages for HIV prevention were sent weekly through Line. Outcomes were HIV and STI knowledge, perceived benefits of condom use, risk reduction self-efficacy, risk reduction behaviors (condom use, the number of sexual partners, and condomless sex), and STI reinfection rate. Independent t-test and binary logistic regression were performed. Results: The B-HIV prevention program significantly increased HIV and STI knowledge and resulted in perception of greater benefits from condoms and greater risk reduction self-efficacy. Program participants used condoms more frequently with many types of partners, especially with casual partners and sex workers. The intervention group practiced condomless sex less frequently than the control group. The program did not improve participants’ condom use with lovers/steady partners and did not decrease the number of sexual partners and STI reinfection rate at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: A B-HIV prevention program could reduce the risk of HIV infection among male clients with current STIs by enhancing their condom use with casual partners and sex workers. Strategies to improve condom use with lovers/steady partners among this high-risk population is needed."
"Impact of AlCl3 and FeCl2 Addition on Catalytic Behaviors of TiCl4/MgCl2/THF Catalysts for Ethylene Polymerization and Ethylene/1-Hexene Copolymerization Copyright  2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.The present research focuses on elucidating of the impact of Lewis acids including AlCl3 and FeCl2 addition on catalytic behaviors during ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization over the TiCl4/MgCl2/THF catalyst (Cat. A). In this study, the Cat. A with the absence and presence of Lewis acids was synthesized via the chemical route. Then, all catalyst samples were characterized and tested in the slurry polymerization. For ethylene polymerization, using the Cat. A with the presence of AlCl3 apparently gave the highest activity among other catalysts. In addition, the activity of catalysts tended to increase with the presence of the Lewis acids. This can be attributed to an enhancement of active center distribution by the addition of Lewis acids leading to larger amounts of the isolated Ti species. Moreover, with the presence of Lewis acids, the effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity was also less pronounced. Considering ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, it revealed that the catalyst with the presence of mixed Lewis acids (AlCl3 + FeCl2) exhibited the highest activity. It is suggested that the presence of mixed Lewis acids possibly caused a change in acidity of active sites, which is suitable for copolymerization. However, activities of all catalysts in ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization were lower than those in ethylene polymerization. The effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity for both polymerization and copolymerization system was found to be similar with the presence of Lewis acids. Based on this study, it is quite promising to enhance the catalytic activity by addition of proper Lewis acids, especially when the pressure of hydrogen increases. The characteristics of polymers obtained upon the presence of Lewis acids will be discussed further in more detail."
"Vonoprazan versus proton-pump inhibitors for gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection-induced ulcers: A systematic review and meta-analysis  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Acid secretion inhibitors are usually prescribed to promote the healing of artificial ulcers caused by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) to reduce the risk of gastric perforation and delayed bleeding. Vonoprazan is a newer agent that has been shown to be more potent than a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). However, it remains unclear whether vonoprazan is more effective than PPI in promoting healing of ulcers caused by ESD. Medline and Embase databases were searched through January 2018 for studies that compared the rate of complete healing of ulcers caused by ESD and post-ESD delayed bleeding in patients who received vonoprazan versus those who received PPI after ESD. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q-statistic and I 2. A total of six studies consisting of 461 patients were identified. The likelihood that ulcers caused by ESD were completely healed at 4-8 weeks after the procedure was significantly higher among patients who received vonoprazan compared with those who received PPI, with a pooled OR of 2.27 (95% CI=1.38-3.73; I 2 =0%). The risk of developing post-ESD delayed bleeding was also numerically lower among those who received vonoprazan, with a pooled OR of 0.79, although the result did not reach statistical significance (95% CI=0.18-3.49; I 2 =29%). This study found that patients who received vonoprazan after ESD had a significantly higher rate of completely healed ulcers compared with those who received PPI."
"Cardol triene inhibits dengue infectivity by targeting kl loops and preventing envelope fusion  2018, The Author(s).Dengue virus causes a global burden that specific chemotherapy has not been established. A previous report suggested that anacardic acid inhibited hepatitis C virus infection. Here, we explored structure activity relationship of anacardic acid, cardanol, and cardol homologues with anti-DENV cellular infectivities. Cardol triene showed the highest therapeutic index at 29.07 with the CC50 and EC50 of 207.30 ± 5.24 and 7.13 ± 0.72 µM, respectively. Moreover, we observed that the more unsaturated the hydrocarbon tail, the higher the CC50s in all head groups. High CC50s were also found in HepG-2, THP-1, and HEK-293 cell lines where cardol triene CC50s were 140.27 ± 8.44, 129.77 ± 12.08, and 92.80 ± 3.93 µM, respectively. Cardol triene expressed pan-dengue inhibition with the EC50s of 5.35 to 8.89 µM and kl loops of dengue envelope proteins were major targets. The strong binding energy at T48, E49, A50, P53, K128, V130, L135, M196, L198, Q200, W206, L207, I270, and L277 prevented cellular pH-dependent fusion. Zika virus kl loops were aligned in the closed position preventing cardol triene to bind and inhibit fusion and infectivity. This study showed for the first time that cardol triene had a potential for further development as anti-dengue inhibitors."
"The metal kiln with heat distribution pipes for high quality charcoal and wood vinegar production  2018 International Energy InitiativeThe metal kiln with heat distribution pipes is a new design of charcoal kiln for high quality charcoal and wood vinegar production. It was made of sheet steel. Its body was covered with fiberglass and galvanized steel as an insulator with the size of 1.5 m height and 2 m diameter. There were six exhaust chimneys connecting to a condenser unit for wood vinegar condensation. A raw material for testing efficiency of charcoal production was bamboo. The metal kiln contained about 1446 kg of bamboo with a moisture content of 30%. The process used 279 kg fire wood. It took 27 h for heating up to >600 °C, and cooled down naturally within 15 h. The products were 315 kg bamboo charcoal, 12 kg ash, and 900 L crude bamboo vinegar. There was no unburnt bamboo. In other words they were 24% good bamboo charcoal, 0% unburnt bamboo and 1% ash. Bamboo charcoal characterization followed the ASTM D7582-15 and ASTM D5865-10. Bamboo charcoal showed 8.5% moisture content, 7.7% volatile matters, 81% fixed carbon, 11.3% ash and 30,347 kJ kg−1 heat values."
"Major depression model induced by repeated and intermittent lipopolysaccharide administration: Long-lasting behavioral, neuroimmune and neuroprogressive alterations  2018 Elsevier LtdMajor depressed patients show increased bacterial translocation with elevated plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which may trigger immune-inflammatory and neuro-oxidative responses. Recently, an animal model based on chronic LPS administration was developed which was associated with long-lasting depressive-like and neuro-oxidative alterations in female mice. The aim of the current study was to investigate behavioral, neuroimmune and neuroprogressive alterations in female mice 6 weeks after LPS chronic exposure. Female mice received increasing doses of LPS during 5 days at one-month intervals repeated for 4 consecutive months. Six weeks after the last LPS-exposure, we assessed behavioral despair and anhedonia, microglial activation, alterations in tryptophan, 5-HT, kynurenine, quinolinic acid (QUIN) levels and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1) expression in the hippocampus, both with and without fluoxetine administration. Our results show that six weeks post-LPS, mice present behavioral despair and anhedonia in association with increased IBA1 expression (a microglia activation marker), NF-kB p65 and IL-1β levels, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) mRNA expression, kynurenine, QUIN levels and QUIN/tryptophan ratio, and lowered tryptophan, 5-HT levels and SAT1 mRNA expression. Fluoxetine reversed the behavioral and neuroimmune alterations but had no effect in the reversal of IDO1 increased expression, QUIN levels and QUIN/tryptophan ratio. In conclusion, our results support the validity of the chronic LPS model of major depression and additionally shows its translational relevance with respect to neuroimmune and neuroprogressive pathways."
"Metal accumulation in the marine bivalve, Marcia optima collected from the coastal area of Phuket Bay, Thailand  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Metal contamination in seafood has raised public health concerns, especially for local residents who live in coastal areas. In this study, the levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and zinc (Zn) were determined in the marine bivalve, Marcia optima, as well as in water, and sediment samples collected from the coastal area of Phuket Bay, Thailand. The results showed that metal concentrations in sediments (4.05–7.14, 16.68–18.13, 164–213 mg kg −1 for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively) and water samples (0.16–0.44, 0.15–0.26, and 0.32–0.48 mg L −1 for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively) were below the threshold effects concentration of the sediment quality guidelines for adverse effects to occur and the marine water quality standards of Thailand. A human risk assessment was performed and the results showed that the risks associated with M. optima consumption at Saphan Hin and Paklok were negligible for most of the metals studied, with the maximum estimated daily intake value being observed for Zn (0.00663 mg kg −1 per day) at Saphan Hin. In addition, Cd, Zn, Pb, and Hg would be unlikely to pose a risk to human health with a hazard quotient of less than 1, with only the bioaccumulation factor of Zn being detectable in both locations (0.034 and 0.026 at Saphan Hin and Paklok, respectively). However, continuous monitoring is encouraged to prevent the risks associated with the consumption of metal-contaminated seafood."
"Incorporation of 13 C-HCO 3 − by ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria during ammonia oxidation of sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) have recently been proposed as potential players for ammonia removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, there is little evidence directly showing the contribution of AOA to ammonia oxidation in these engineered systems. In this study, DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) with labeled 13 C-HCO 3 − was introduced to sludge from a municipal WWTP. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that AOA amoA genes outnumbered AOB amoA genes in this WWTP sludge. AOA amoA gene sequence analysis revealed that AOA present in this WWTP were specific to one subcluster within the group 1.1b Thaumarchaeota. When ammonia was supplied to DNA-SIP incubation, the DNA-SIP profiles demonstrated the incorporation of the 13 C into AOA and AOB. However, the 13 C was not found to be assimilated into both microorganisms in the incubation without ammonia. Specific primers were designed to target amoA genes of AOA belonging to the subcluster found in this WWTP. Applying the primers to DNA-SIP experiment revealed that AOA of this subcluter most likely utilized inorganic carbon during ammonia oxidation under the studied conditions."
"Effects of varying soil and atmospheric water deficit on water use characteristics of tropical street tree species  2018 Elsevier GmbHUrban trees provide several ecosystem services, yet they are less studied compared to trees in natural ecosystems. Investigating ecophysiological responses of different tree species to seasonal conditions and drought will help determine which would succeed in urban conditions. Here, we examined water use characteristics of common species in Bangkok, Thailand: Pterocarpus indicus (Pi), Swietenia macrophylla (Sm) and Lagerstroemia speciosa (Ls), with different phenology, under seasonal variations and soil drying. Thirty small trees were potted and irrigated to ≥80% of the field capacity (θFC) of the soil. Granier-type sensors were used to measure sap flux density from 23 August to 18 December 2017. Drought treatments were imposed on five trees of each species by withholding irrigation until θ reached ∼50% θFC. Results suggested that water use patterns of semi-evergreen and evergreen species (Pi and Sm) were not sensitive to either seasonal or soil moisture variations while deciduous species (Ls) exhibited decreased water use and earlier stomatal closure upon soil drying in the dry season. These findings suggested that water use characteristics of the evergreen species may conserve water use regardless of atmospheric and soil moisture conditions while those of the deciduous species may result in high cost for irrigation in the wet season. Nevertheless, we believe that both evergreen and deciduous species may be selected for planting to maximize greening areas in cities throughout the year. However, knowledge of different water use characteristics of street tree species should be applied to devise strategic planning for optimized irrigation in urban greening."
"The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers combined with calcium channel blockers on metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients: a meta-analysis  2018, Springer Nature B.V.Background: The prevalence of hypertension and its associated complications are markedly growing. Most patients need more than one drug to achieve blood pressure (BP) target. However, most guidelines only focus on the first-line treatment. We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combined with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials.gov (until April 7, 2016) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the benefits of ACEIs/ARBs combined with CCBs versus other dual or triple combinations on clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients. Random effects models were used to compute the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables. Results: Sixty RCTs (48,913 patients) were identified. When compared with other combinations, the combination of ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs had comparable WMD of systolic as well as diastolic BP (73 study arms) but provided better benefits on metabolic parameters, such as HDL, FBS, HbA1C, and serum uric acid; renal functions, including serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate; and cardiovascular diseases, including reduction of all cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, and syncope/hypotension. A significant increase of serum potassium was observed. Conclusion: The combination of ACEIs/ARBs with CCBs has superior benefits on metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients. Therefore, this combination should be considered whenever monotherapy does not achieve the guideline target."
"Comparison between digital image analysis and visual assessment of immunohistochemical HER2 expression in breast cancer  2018 Elsevier GmbHBackground: Assessment of HER2 status is considered standard of care in the histopathologic workup of breast cancer and conveys prognostic and predictive information used to guide treatment decisions. The assessment is often carried out in a two-step approach where immunohistochemical expression of HER2 protein is first evaluated by conventional microscopy and equivocal cases are further analyzed by in-situ hybridization techniques to assess gene amplification status. In this study we compared conventional manual assessment of immunohistochemical HER2 expression with digital image analysis (DIA) and consensus manual assessment by a panel of three pathologists. Methods: From our archive we retrieved sections of 109 invasive breast carcinomas stained for HER2 with corresponding HER2 score from the original pathology report. The glass slides were assessed by three pathologists to reach a consensus score. Next, the slides were scanned into whole slide images and DIA was performed using Aperio Imagescope. The scoring results were then compared with gene amplification status evaluated by dual in-situ hybridization (DISH). Results: Comparing manual assessment with consensus assessment and DIA, good agreement was obtained with weighted kappa coefficients of 0.79 (manual vs. consensus) and 0.67 (manual vs. DIA). When compared with gene status assessment by DISH, agreement analysis yielded weighted kappa coefficients of 0.52 (manual vs. DISH), 0.58 (consensus vs. DISH) and 0.78 (DIA vs. DISH). There were no false negatives by any of the three methods and false positives ranging from 0.9 to 2.8%. The proportion of equivocal cases by each method was 44% (manual), 33.3% (consensus) and 14.7% (DIA). Application of DIA reduced the number of equivocal cases by 67% without increasing the proportion of false negatives. Conclusion: We conclude that DIA is an accurate method to reduce the number of HER2 equivocal cases without affecting the sensitivity of the HER2 assessment."
"Chitosan-based nanoparticles with damnacanthal suppress CRM1 expression  Chaichanasak et al.Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Phytochemicals may be promising anticancer agents given their various chemical structures and diverse biological activities. Damnacanthal (DAM) is a major bioactive component of Noni, which has been investigated previously as a cancer-preventive or chemotherapeutic agent. DAM has also been reported to exhibit anti-proliferative activity in several cancer types. In the present study, it was identified that DAM downregulates chromosome maintenance protein 1 (CRM1) expression in human cancer cells. The application of chitosan-based nanoparticles (NPs) with DAM also induced CRM1 downregulation, which suggests that chitosan-based NPs may be effective vehicles for delivery of phytochemicals such as DAM. It was also identified that DAM increased the levels of the tumor suppressor non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-activated gene 1 in the nucleus, thereby leading to enhanced anticancer effects. The results of the present study indicate that DAM and its nanoformulation may be a candidate anticancer drug."
"Evaluation of Plasmodium vivax isolates in Thailand using polymorphic markers Plasmodium merozoite surface protein (PvMSP) 1 and PvMSP3  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Malaria is a significant public health problem in several tropical countries including Thailand. The prevalence of Plasmodium vivax infection has been increasing in the past decades. Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein (PvMSP) gene encodes a malaria vaccine candidate antigen. Its polymorphic nature leads to antigenic variation, the barrier for vaccine development, drug resistance, and potential for multiple-clone infections within the malaria patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of PvMSP1 and PvMSP3 gene in P. vivax populations in Thailand. A total of 100 P. vivax isolates collected from the western (Kanchanaburi and Tak Provinces) and southern (Ranong Provinces) regions along the Thai-Myanmar border were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Analysis of the F1, F2, and F3 regions of PvMSP1 revealed 5, 2, and 3 allelic variants, respectively. Three major types of PvMSP3-α and two major types of PvMSP3-β were identified based on the PCR product sizes. After digestion with restriction enzymes, 29, 25, 26, and 18 patterns were distinguished by RFLP for PvMSP1 (F2, Alu I), PvMSP1 (F2, Mnl I), PvMSP3-α, and PvMSP3-β, respectively. Combination of each family variant (PvMSP1 and PvMSP3) resulted in high genetic polymorphism of P. vivax population. Additionally, using PvMSP1 polymorphic marker revealed a significant association between multiple-genotype infections and P. vivax parasitemia. The results strongly supported that P. vivax populations in the endemic areas along the Thai-Myanmar border are highly diverse."
"Detection of host pathways universally inhibited after Plasmodium yoelii infection for immune intervention  2018, The Author(s).Malaria is a disease with diverse symptoms depending on host immune status and pathogenicity of Plasmodium parasites. The continuous parasite growth within a host suggests mechanisms of immune evasion by the parasite and/or immune inhibition in response to infection. To identify pathways commonly inhibited after malaria infection, we infected C57BL/6 mice with four Plasmodium yoelii strains causing different disease phenotypes and 24 progeny of a genetic cross. mRNAs from mouse spleens day 1 and/or day 4 post infection (p.i.) were hybridized to a mouse microarray to identify activated or inhibited pathways, upstream regulators, and host genes playing an important role in malaria infection. Strong interferon responses were observed after infection with the N67 strain, whereas initial inhibition and later activation of hematopoietic pathways were found after infection with 17XNL parasite, showing unique responses to individual parasite strains. Inhibitions of pathways such as Th1 activation, dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and NFAT immune regulation were observed in mice infected with all the parasite strains day 4 p.i., suggesting universally inhibited immune pathways. As a proof of principle, treatment of N67-infected mice with antibodies against T cell receptors OX40 or CD28 to activate the inhibited pathways enhanced host survival. Controlled activation of these pathways may provide important strategies for better disease management and for developing an effective vaccine."
"Classification of unusual insertion of the pectoralis minor muscle  2018, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: The pectoralis minor muscle (PMi) generally originates from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs and inserts on the medial and superior margins of the anterior portion of the coracoid process. Variations in the shape and attachment point of the PMi could cause discomfort in the shoulders. The aim of this study was to observe the types of morphological insertion patterns and attachment sites of the PMi. Methods: Seventy-four sides of fresh, embalmed Korean (42 sides; mean age 78 years) and Thai (32 sides; mean age 78 years) cadavers were dissected to analyze the morphological insertion types and attachment sites of the PMi. Results: Unusual insertion patterns were evident in about 23% of the samples. When the portion of the PMi tendon ran over the coracoid process, the most common attachment site was the glenohumeral joint capsule. We also confirmed the attachment of the PMi to the clavicle. Costal attachments of the PMi that extend from the second rib to the fourth rib were observed frequently as well. Conclusions: Unusual insertion patterns of the PMi are common. Some authors consider that tendon attachment to the joint capsule can cause shoulder pain. In addition, the PMi tendon could be utilized in acromioclavicular joint reconstruction. Surgeons need to be aware of the possibility of a PMi variant being found during surgery even when this is not visible in magnetic resonance or ultrasound imaging."
Scaling laws for static displacement of linearly elastic cracked beam by energy method  2018 Elsevier LtdExperimental studies on the problem of crack identification can be simplified and enhanced through the concept of structural similarity since the behaviors of a full-scale structure can be investigated using a reduced-scale model. The structural similarity of a rectangular cross-section beam with a through-thickness edge crack and elastically supported was investigated. The beam was subjected to concentrated forces perpendicular to its longitudinal axis and concentrated bending moments. Complete similarity conditions and scaling laws for static deflection and slope of the cracked beam were derived using the principle of conservation of energy and the strain energy release rate approach within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Accuracy of the derived complete similarity conditions and scaling laws were experimentally and numerically verified. The concept of incorporating the similarity theory to problems of structural health monitoring was explained.
"Data in support of photosynthetic responses in a chromosome segment substitution line of ‘Khao Dawk Mali 105’ rice at seedling stage  2018 The AuthorsThe rice chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of ‘Khao Dawk Mali 105’ (‘KDML105’) genetic background were developed by backcrossing with ‘KDML105’ rice and transferring the region from chromosome 1 of DH212 which was expected to contain the full putative salt tolerance genetic region. Line of CSSL11, CSSL12, and CSSL16 contained the full putative salt tolerance genetic region were evaluated with the parental lines, ‘KDML105’ and DH212 at seedling stage of rice. The physiological responses in rice plants were grown under normal condition and 75 mM of NaCl, and then comparative photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, PhiPS2, ETR, NPQ, as well as growth analysis. In this article, the data of physiological response evaluation in rice at seedling stage after salt stress treatment can be found. This can be useful as the information of the photosynthesis response to salt stress to other rice cultivars and related species."
"Inflammatory reaction, clinical efficacy, and safety of bacterial cellulose wound dressing containing silk sericin and polyhexamethylene biguanide for wound treatment  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Bacterial cellulose wound dressings containing silk sericin and PHMB (BCSP) were developed in our previous studies. It had good physical properties, efficacy, and safety. For further use as a medical material, this dressing was investigated for its efficacy and safety in split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor-site wound treatment compared to Bactigras® (control). Moreover, the inflammatory responses to both dressings were also deeply investigated. For in vivo study, expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines were intensely considered in the tissue interfacing area. The result showed that IL-4 and TGF-β from BCSP-treated tissue had advantages over Bactigras®-treated tissue at 14 and 21 days post-implantation. For clinical study, a single-blinded, randomized controlled study was generated. The half of STSG donor site wound was randomly assigned to cover with BCSP or Bactigras®. Twenty-one patients with 32 STSG donor site wounds were enrolled. The results showed that wound-healing time was not significantly different in both dressings. However, wound quality of BCSP was better than Bactigras® at healing time and after 1 month (p < 0.05). The pain scores of BCSP-treated wound were statistically significant lower than Bactigras®-treated wound (p < 0.05). No sign of infection or adverse event was observed after treatment with both dressings. In conclusion, the inflammation responses of the dressing were clearly clarified. The advantages of BCSP were wound-quality improvement, pain reduction, and infection protection without adverse events. It was fit to be used as the alternative treatment of STSG donor site wound."
"Caring for Thai Older Persons With Long-Term Care Needs  The Author(s) 2018.Objective: To provide a situation analysis of recent long-term care (LTC) needs among older persons in Thailand. Method: The 2014 Survey of Older Persons in Thailand (SOPT) provides data to assess patterns of caregiving, whether care needs are met, and who are main caregivers for older Thais. We examine how types of familial and nonfamilial caregivers are associated with the well-being of older persons. Results: The need for LTC increases sharply with age and is more common among women than men. Spouses and children constitute approximately 90% of main caregivers. The association of a family member as the main caregiver and education or value of assets is quite weak underscoring the general normative prescription for family members to serve as care providers. Discussion: Thailand is experiencing acute population aging but empirical evidence to support LTC needs remains lacking. This analysis helps close the gap."
"Facilitated transport of cadmium with montmorillonite KSF colloids under different pH conditions in water-saturated sand columns: Experiment and transport modeling  2018 Elsevier LtdThis study investigated the impact of pH on the migration of cadmium(II) ions (Cd2+) in relation to montmorillonite KSF colloids through a water-saturated sand column (WSSC). The sorption isotherms of Cd2+ on colloids and sand at pH values of 3, 6, and 8 were characterized by batch experiments. Cd2+ sorption by colloids and sand fit well with the Freundlich model. In the column experiments, increasing the pH increased the retardation factors and KF values of Cd2+ both with and without the presence of the colloids. The amount of Cd2+ sorbed onto the montmorillonite KSF colloids in the column effluent increased from 0.29 to 0.97 mg as the pH increased. The colloid increased Cd2+ mobility and acted as a carrier at a high solution pH. The increasing level of Cd2+ sorbed on colloids as the pH increased resulted in a long tailing of the breakthrough curve (BTC) of the total Cd, indicating that the total Cd was controlled by rate-limited reactions. These findings indicate that when the solution pH was greater than the point of zero charge (PZC) of the colloids (pH > 6), the system tended to follow a nonequilibrium two-site (TSM) model rather than an equilibrium (CDeq) model. This implies that the PZC of the colloids in the groundwater system is the main factor in predicting facilitated Cd2+ transport."
"Adaptive effect of sericin on hepatic mitochondrial conformation through its regulation of apoptosis, autophagy and energy maintenance: a proteomics approach  2018, The Author(s).We recently demonstrated that in addition to its protective effect on pancreatic and adrenal biosynthesis, antioxidant properties of sericin decrease blood cholesterol levels and improve the liver mitochondrial architecture. However, little is known about the detailed mechanisms underlying these effects. Using proteomics and electron microscopy, we identified mitochondrial proteins that play important roles in the preservation of the mitochondrial ultrastructure and cholesterol-lowering properties of sericin. Our results showed that sericin maintains the mitochondrial architecture during conditions of high blood cholesterol by regulating apoptotic (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit) and autophagic (mitochondrial elongation factor Tu and prohibitin-2) proteins as well as energy maintenance proteins [haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing protein 3, succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein subunit, ATP synthase-α subunit precursor, enoyl-CoA hydratase domain-containing protein 3 and electron transfer flavoprotein subunit-α]. Sericin also exerts anti-oxidative properties via aconitate hydratase and Chain A, crystal structure of rat carnitine palmitoyltrasferase 2 proteins. Together, these activities may reduce hepatocytic triglyceride deposition, thereby decreasing steatosis, as demonstrated by the modulatory effects on ornithine aminotransferase, mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, acyl-CoA synthase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Sericin activity further balanced nitrogenous waste detoxification, characterised by carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (ammonia), aldehyde dehydrogenase and uricase, or folate biosynthesis via sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethyl glycine dehydrogenase. These results suggest that sericin maintains the hepatic mitochondrial architecture through apoptotic, autophagic, energy maintenance and anti-oxidative mitochondrial proteins for alleviating hepatic steatosis and promoting liver function under conditions of hypercholesterolaemia."
"Discharge Performance of Zinc-Air Flow Batteries Under the Effects of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate and Pluronic F-127  2018, The Author(s).Zinc-air batteries are a promising technology for large-scale electricity storage. However, their practical deployment has been hindered by some issues related to corrosion and passivation of the zinc anode in an alkaline electrolyte. In this work, anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and nonionic surfactant Pluronic F-127 (P127) are examined their applicability to enhance the battery performances. Pristine zinc granules in 7 M KOH, pristine zinc granules in 0–8 mM SDS/7 M KOH, pristine zinc granules in 0–1000 ppm P127/7 M KOH, and SDS coated zinc granules in 7 M KOH were examined. Cyclic voltammograms, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that using 0.2 mM SDS or 100 ppm P127 effectively suppressed the anode corrosion and passivation. Nevertheless, direct coating SDS on the zinc anode showed adverse effects because the thick layer of SDS coating acted as a passivating film and blocked the removal of the anode oxidation product from the zinc surface. Furthermore, the performances of the zinc-air flow batteries were studied. Galvanostatic discharge results indicated that the improvement of discharge capacity and energy density could be sought by the introduction of the surfactants to the KOH electrolyte. The enhancement of specific discharge capacity for 30% and 24% was observed in the electrolyte containing 100 ppm P127 and 0.2 mM SDS, respectively."
"Influence of anisotropic properties on vertical vibrations of circular foundation on saturated elastic layer  2018 Elsevier LtdIn this paper, the influence of anisotropy material properties on vertical vibrations of rigid circular foundation resting on a transversely isotropic poroelastic layer with finite thickness and a rigid base is studied. The contact surface between foundation and saturated layer is smooth, and either permeable or impermeable. This dynamic interaction problem is investigated by employing a discretization technique and the Hankel integral transform method. The proposed numerical solution scheme is validated with existing solutions, and selected numerical results are presented to portray the influence of anisotropic properties and other parameters on the vertical compliance of the foundation."
"Generation and characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with enhanced cancer stem cell potential  2018 The Authors. Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes for cancer-related death worldwide with rapidly increasing incidence and mortality rates. As for other types of cancers, also in HCC cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumour initiation, progression and therapy failure. However, as rare subpopulations of tumour tissue, CSCs are difficult to isolate, thus making the development of suitable and reliable model systems necessary. In our study, we generated HepG2 subclones with enriched CSC potential by application of the spheroid formation method and subsequent single-cell cloning. Analyses in several 2D and 3D cell culture systems as well as a panel of functional assays both in vitro and in vivo revealed that the generated subclones displayed characteristic and sustained features of tumour initiating cells as well as highly aggressive properties related to tumour progression and metastasis. These characteristics could clearly be correlated with the expression of CSC markers that might have prognostic value in the clinical HCC setting. Therefore, we conclude that our CSC enriched HepG2 clones certainly represent suitable model systems to study the role of CSCs during HCC initiation, progression and drug resistance."
"Evaluation of different pretreatments of Napier grass for enzymatic saccharification and ethanol production  2018 The Authors. Energy Science & Engineering published by the Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Due to its fast-growing and high carbohydrate content, Napier grass has a great potential to be chosen as a raw material for renewable energy production. The Napier grass after different pretreatments was tested for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with dried yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and cellulase (CTec2) to produce ethanol. For alkaline pretreatment, the grass was incubated with 10% NaOH at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) at 90°C for 1 hour. For dilute acid pretreatment, the grass was soaked with 1% H2SO4 at a ratio of 1:10 (w/v) and incubated at 120°C for 1 hour. For the two-stage pretreatment, the resultant solid from dilute acid pretreatment was further treated with 2% NaOH (1:10 w/v) at 80°C for 6 hours. After enzymatic saccharification at 50°C and pH 5.0 for 96 hours using CTec2, yields of glucose from three pretreated Napier grass samples (10% water-insoluble solids, WIS) were 75.4 ± 2.9%, 55.4 ± 6.5%, and 76.4 ± 5.0%. Using 10% WIS of alkaline-pretreated Napier grass biomass as the substrate, the 72-hour SSF led to an ethanol yield of 86.6 ± 3.4%. On the basis of the dried biomass of Napier grass as the raw material, the ethanol yield could reach 0.143 ± 0.006 (g/g). Napier grass biomass could be effectively treated by alkaline, dilute acid, or two-stage pretreatment methods to remove non-cellulosic components to some extent. Alkaline pretreatment was found to be superior to dilute acid and two-stage pretreatment methods, based on ethanol yields obtained under similar SSF conditions."
"Biofuel production via the pyrolysis of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) leaves: Characterization of the optimal conditions  2018 Elsevier B.V.Sugarcane leaves, a lightweight lignocellulosic biomass from a harvested crop, represent a feedstock for in situ pyrolysis to biofuels and valuable chemicals, facilitating the collection and transportation of pyrolyzed oil to industry. In this paper, the pyrolyzed products were separated into water/aqueous and bio-oil fractions, and the yield was characterized. Pyrolysis was performed in a screw-driven custom-built pyrolysis reactor. The effects of pyrolysis parameters, including the temperature (400–650 °C), feedstock feed rate (0.3–1.8 kg h−1), average size distribution (250 µm, 500 µm and 750 µm) and N2 sweeping gas flow rate (80–240 cm3 min−1) were investigated systematically. The results show that the temperature and residence time according to the N2 sweep gas also mainly affects the bio-oil yield and properties such as the acidity, heating value, viscosity and chemical composition, with the highest bio-oil yield (40.16 wt%) obtained at 500 °C, a feed rate of 0.4 kg h−1, an average biomass feedstock particle size of 500 µm, and an inert N2 flow rate of 120 cm3 min−1. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the chemical composition revealed aromatic derivatives, phenols, ketones, and oxygenated compounds of high molecular weight that might be useful chemical products. These results indicate that pyrolyzed oil cannot be utilized as a biofuel directly but instead must be pretreated. The oil should be treated by a co-catalytic pyrolysis process to be considered a potential source for energy and valuable chemicals. In addition, the biochar was analyzed to determine whether it can be used for the production of activated carbon."
"Is the occiput-wall distance valid and reliable to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis?  2018Background: Hyperkyphosis may be frequently found nowadays due to the change in current lifestyles of sustained flexion postures and age-related system decline. The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs > 0.9, P < 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846). Conclusion: The findings support validity and reliability of OWD, and offer a clear cut-off point to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis for clinical utility in various settings."
"Optimization of process parameters using response surface methodology for Pd(II) extraction with quaternary ammonium salt from chloride medium: kinetic and thermodynamics study  2018, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.Abstract: In this study, liquid–liquid extraction with Aliquat 336 in the presence of cyclohexane as a mobile carrier was investigated to purify Pd(II) from industrial wastewater. Kinetic and thermodynamics analysis showed that Pd(II) extraction was of first-order reaction: the reaction was endothermic reaction which was governed by the diffusion region. The influence of temperature on isotherm model was also investigated. With an increase in reaction temperature, all three isotherms Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm become inaccurate. Results show that the Langmuir isotherm model was preferred for the study of the Pd(II) ion experimental isotherm. Response surface methodology was employed to study the five independent variables which have an effect on the percentage of extraction of palladium(II) ions as a dependent variable. Optimum extraction conditions for the five independent variables were as follows: Aliquat 336 concentration (0.6 M), pH of feed solution (2.0), stirring speed (600 rpm), reaction time (10 min.) and reaction temperature (318 K)."
"Loss of Gsα in osteocytes leads to osteopenia due to sclerostin induced suppression of osteoblast activity  2018The stimulatory subunit of G-protein, Gsα acts as a secondary messenger of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that primarily activates cAMP-induced signaling. GPCRs, such as the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR), are critical regulators of bone formation as shown by number of genetic manipulation studies targeting early osteoblast lineage cells. In this study, we have examined the role of Gsα in osteocytes, the terminally differentiated and most abundant cells of the osteoblast lineage. Mice lacking the stimulatory subunit of G-proteins (Gsα) in osteocytes (DMP1-GsαKO) have significant decrease of both trabecular and cortical bone, as assessed by μCT. Histomorphometric analysis showed that the osteopenia was mostly driven by more than 90% decrease in osteoblast numbers and activity whereas osteoclasts were only slightly decreased. The decrease in osteoblast number was associated with a striking lack of endocortical osteoblasts. We have previously shown that loss of the stimulatory subunit of G-proteins (Gsα) in osteocytes in vitro or in vivo induces high expression of sclerostin. To determine if the increased sclerostin levels contributed to the decreased endosteal bone lining cells and osteopenia, we treated wild-type mice with recombinant sclerostin and the DMP1-GsαKO mice with anti-sclerostin antibody. Treatment of wild-type mice with 100 μg/kg sclerostin for 3-weeks significantly reduced the numbers of bone lining cells and led to osteopenia. Next, the DMP1-GsαKO and control littermates were treated with the anti-sclerostin antibody (25 mg/kg, 2 times per week) for 4-weeks. Upon the antibody treatment, the endocortical osteoblasts reappeared in the DMP1-GsαKO mice to a comparable level to that of the vehicle treated control littermates. In control mice, E11/gp38 positive osteocytes were observed in parallel with the endocortical osteoblasts with higher dendrite density towards the endocortical osteoblasts. In DMP1-GsαKO mice, E11/gp38 positive osteocytes were lacking dendrites and were randomly scattered throughout the bone matrix. After treatment with anti-sclerostin antibody, DMP1-GsαKO mice showed increased E11/gp38 positive osteocytes near the endosteal bone surface and endosteal osteoblasts. The anti-sclerostin antibody treatment proportionally increased the bone volume but it could not completely rescue the osteopenia in the DMP1-GsαKO mice. Taken together, this data suggests that Gsα signaling in osteocytes leads to osteopenia driven, at least in part, by increased secretion of sclerostin."
"Intracatheter Antifungal Lock Leading to Detrimental Complications  2018 The AuthorsAs peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related fungal infection is associated with a high mortality rate, the international guidelines recommend immediate removal of the PD catheter in conjunction with at least 2-weeks of antifungal treatment. Some authors have reported successful management of such cases without removing the PD catheter - by instilling an antifungal lock into the retained PD catheter. However, the use of antifungal locks has generally not been well accepted as the standard treatment for fungal peritonitis in PD patients. We report two cases where antifungal lock were performed in PD patients presented with PD-related fungal infection that not only had no effect on abating the infection but also causing paradoxical outcomes."
"Optimization of exposure parameters in dental cone beam computed tomography using a 3-step approach  2018 Elsevier Inc.Objective: The aim of this study was to find the optimal balance among tube voltage (kV), tube current (mA), and exposure time (s) in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Study Design: Three human hemimandibles were scanned by using the 3D Accuitomo 170 scanner (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan). First, 3 combinations of kilovolt (kV) and milliampere (mA) were used at a constant radiation dose. Seven observers evaluated the images; the kV of the highest-scoring scan was considered optimal. Second, the lowest acceptable mA for visualizing different anatomic structures was determined. Finally, the samples were scanned by using 3 combinations of tube current and exposure time; the observers determined the combination with the highest image quality. Results: At a constant radiation dose, the highest available voltage (i.e., 90 kV) resulted in the highest image quality in terms of general impression, sharpness, noise, and artefacts. Depending on the anatomic structure, mA reductions of 20% to 40% compared with the default setting were possible. Fast-scan protocols showed equal or slightly better image quality compared with the standard-scan mode. Conclusions: For the CBCT model used in this study, optimization implies the use of the highest kV along with the shortest exposure time and a task-specific mA. The proposed stepwise optimization approach could be applied to any CBCT unit, preferably during commissioning."
"A randomized trial of low-dose gabapentin for post hospitalization relapse prevention in a Thai clinical sample of alcohol dependence  2018 Elsevier B.V.Pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder show a modest effect, and they are unavailable in certain countries. The study's aim is to investigate the effects of gabapentin on alcohol drinking. One hundred twelve Thai individuals with alcohol dependence and very high alcohol consumption were randomly assigned to either of two groups: gabapentin treatment or placebo. Oral treatment with at least 300 mg of gabapentin per day or placebo was administered once a day for twelve weeks. The alcohol drinking pattern was assessed by means of the timeline followback method. The drinking behaviours of the two groups were compared by means of the Poisson repeated measures model and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis. Twenty subjects (35.7%) from the gabapentin group and 14 subjects (25.0%) from the placebo group completed the study protocol. The participants in the gabapentin group did not differ from those in the placebo group with respect to demographics or baseline alcohol drinking behaviour. After follow-up, the gabapentin group showed a lower percentage of heavy drinking days per week than the placebo group (p < 0.005). GEE analysis showed treatment by time interaction on lowering drinking days within a week (p < 0.05). In conclusion, gabapentin may be used to reduce alcohol-drinking behaviours."
"Three-dimensional lower bound finite element limit analysis of Hoek-Brown material using semidefinite programming  2018 Elsevier LtdA reliable and accurate stability analysis in Hoek-Brown rock masses under fully three-dimensional geometries requires an efficient and powerful computational method. This paper presents a computational implementation of a three-dimensional lower bound finite element limit analysis using semidefinite programming for Hoek-Brown rock masses. Its computational performance is investigated extensively through a variety of boundary value problems in rock mechanics, namely triaxial compression, bearing capacity and cavity contraction. New lower bound solutions are numerically derived, including bearing capacity of square footings, uniaxial compression of cube and cylindrical rock specimens with fully rough platens and tension test on double notched rock specimens."
"Clinical and functional studies of two novel variants in the LPL gene in subjects with severe hypertriglyceridemia  2018 Elsevier B.V.Background: Two novel variants (p.Arg270Gly and p.Asp308Glyfs*3) in the LPL gene have recently been identified in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). In this study, we investigated clinical and genetic features of their families and examined the functional significance of these two variants in vitro. Methods: Clinical and genetic data were collected. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression in cld cells were performed. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mass and activity were measured. Results: In vitro studies showed that LPL mass and activity in the media of cells transfected with the p.Arg270Gly variant were significantly reduced. In the cell lysates, however, LPL mass was preserved but LPL activity was reduced, suggesting that the LPL defect was in the secretion and activity. For the p.Asp308Glyfs*3 variant, LPL mass in the cell lysate was relatively preserved compared to that of the wild-type, while LPL mass in the media was decreased albeit not significantly. LPL activities in the cell lysate and in the media of cells transfected with this variant were significantly reduced, suggesting that the p.Asp308Glyfs*3 variant might affect the activity, and possibly, secretion of LPL. Conclusions: These novel variants in the LPL gene were likely pathogenic with the defect in secretion and/or activity."
"Topical drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye: The effect of benzalkonium chloride on topical dexamethasone penetration into the eye in vivo  2018 Elsevier B.V.Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is a quaternary ammonium compound with antibacterial properties. It is used as preservative in aqueous eye drops but studies have shown that it can also act as a penetration enhancer increasing drug permeation from the eye surface into the eye. Here the effect of BAC on dexamethasone permeation into the eye was investigated in vivo. Dexamethasone in aqueous cyclodextrin-based eye drops with and without BAC, were administered to rabbits and the dexamethasone concentration in several eye tissues determined 2 h after the administration. The study shows that BAC has no effect on the drug penetration from the eye surface into the eye. The penetration enhancing effect of BAC is mainly based on in vitro observations where BAC is in contact with isolated epithelial membrane (e.g., cornea) for several hours. Under in vivo conditions, BAC is rapidly washed from the eye surface with the tear fluid before it can penetrate into the epithelia and disrupt its structure sufficiently to allow for enhanced drug permeation into the eye."
"Effect of pressure on the structure stability, electronic structure and band gap engineering in Zn16O1S15  2018 Elsevier B.V.Crystal structures and high pressure structural phase transitions of Zn16O1S15 have been investigated using density functional theory calculation. The two candidate high pressure structures namely Wurtzite and Zincblende were examined for theirs stability and properties up to 20 GPa. The co-exist phase of both structure which occurred during the different film growth conditions was fully explained. Phonon dispersion and the Born criteria reveal that Zincblende is only stable up to 10 GPa. Besides, Wurtzite structure yield no imaginary phonon frequencies and also satisfy the elastic constants sufficiency condition up to 20 GPa which indicated that the co-exist phase would eventually become the single Wurtzite structure above 10 GPa. The electronic structure and PDOS were also fully investigated using HSE06. The multiple band gap energy and mid O-3 state between fundamental ZnS band gap was revealed for the first time. The pressure effect on their electronic structure has been investigated for possible applications in adjustable optoelectronic device."
"Co-overexpression of native phospholipid-biosynthetic genes plsX and plsC enhances lipid production in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803  2018, The Author(s).The overexpression of native plsX and plsC genes involving in fatty acid/phospholipid synthesis first timely-reported the significantly enhanced lipid contents in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Growth rate, intracellular pigment contents including chlorophyll a and carotenoids, and oxygen evolution rate of all overexpressing (OX) strains were normally similar as wild type. For fatty acid compositions, saturated fatty acid, in particular palmitic acid (16:0) was dominantly increased in OX strains whereas slight increases of unsaturated fatty acids were observed, specifically linoleic acid (18:2) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3). The plsC/plsX-overexpressing (OX + XC) strain produced high lipid content of about 24.3%w/dcw under normal condition and was further enhanced up to 39.1%w/dcw by acetate induction. This OX + XC engineered strain was capable of decreasing phaA transcript level which related to poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis under acetate treatment. Moreover, the expression level of gene transcripts revealed that the plsX- and plsC/plsX-overexpression strains had also increased accA transcript amounts which involved in the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Altogether, these overexpressing strains significantly augmented higher lipid contents when compared to wild type by partly overcoming the limitation of lipid production."
"Two host gut-derived lactic acid bacteria activate the proPO system and increase resistance to an AHPND-causing strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei  2018 Elsevier LtdLactic acid bacteria (LAB) are group of beneficial bacteria that have been proposed as relevant probiotics with immunomodulatory functions. In this study, we initially isolated and identified host-derived LAB from the gut of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed two candidate LAB, the Lactobacillus plantarum strain SGLAB01 and the Lactococcus lactis strain SGLAB02, which exhibited 99% identity to the L. plantarum strain LB1-2 and the L. lactis strain R-53658, which were isolated from bee gut, respectively. The two LAB displayed antimicrobial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including the virulent acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND)-causing strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND). Viable colony count and SEM analysis showed that the two candidate LAB, administered via oral route as feed supplement, could reside and adhere in the shrimp gut. Double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing of LvproPO1 and LvproPO2 revealed a significant role of two LvproPOs in the proPO system as well as in the immune response against VPAHPND infection in L. vannamei shrimp. The effect of LAB supplementation on modulation of the shrimp proPO system was investigated in vivo, and the results showed that administration of the two candidate LAB significantly increased hemolymph PO activity, the relative mRNA expression of LvproPO1 and LvproPO2, and resistance to VPAHPND infection. These findings suggest that administration of L. plantarum and L. lactis could modulate the immune system and increase shrimp resistance to VPAHPND infection presumably via upregulation of the two LvproPO transcripts."
"Improved Survival of Elderly-fit Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Requiring Intensive Therapy: 3-Year Multicenter Analysis From TALWG  2018 Elsevier Inc.Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poorer prognosis than younger patients from previous studies. This 3-year multicenter study was conducted on elderly Thai patients with AML, and aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and factors impacting the survival outcome of the patients. From the 235 elderly patients with AML, patients with poor performance status and patients receiving low-intensive therapy had significantly poorer survival outcome. Background: Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poorer prognosis than younger ones. Several factors contribute to the poor outcomes for this patient group. Patients and Methods: This study investigated the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of elderly Thai patients with AML. This 3-year, prospective, multicenter study was focused on Thai patients with AML aged over 60 years who were diagnosed between 2014 and 2016. Results: Of 680 patients with AML, 235 elderly patients with AML (34.6%) were identified, with a mean age of 70 ± 8 years. Using a 3-group cytogenetic risk classification (favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk), the proportions of patients in each category were 3.6%, 73.8%, and 22.6%, respectively. The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 846 days. The median overall survival (OS) of the patients was 128.2 days (range, 0-1205 days), with a 1-year OS of 13%. From a multivariate analysis, the significant factors associated with an improved long-term OS were patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2 and those receiving intensive therapy. Conclusion: Our study confirms the high prevalence of AML in elderly patients with generally poor outcomes. Selected patients with a good performance status and those who received intensive induction treatment could have a long-term survival."
"Changes of cardiac function in diabetic dogs  2018 Elsevier B.V.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate cardiac function and compare the concentration of cardiac biomarkers including cardiac troponin I (cTnI), galectin-3 (Gal-3), and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) in diabetic and control dogs. Animals: Thirty-nine dogs were included. The diabetic and control groups consisted of 19 and 20 dogs, respectively. Methods: Plasma cTnI, Gal-3, and NT-proBNP concentrations were measured in the diabetic and control groups. Echocardiography was performed in all dogs to evaluate cardiac structure and function. Echocardiographic values and cardiac biomarker concentrations between the two groups were compared with the Mann–Whitney U test. The p-value < 0.05 was considered statistical significance. Results: No evidence of cardiac structural changes was detected in diabetic dogs on two-dimensional echocardiography. The echocardiographic values of diabetic and control dogs were within reference intervals. Echocardiographic changes indicating diastolic dysfunction assessed by spectral flow Doppler echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging were found in diabetic dogs (42.10%) compared with control dogs (10.00%; p = 0.022). Diabetic dogs with durations of diabetes mellitus > 1 year had an increased left ventricular wall thickness and echocardiographic changes suggesting diastolic dysfunction compared with those with duration of diabetes mellitus < 1 year. No evidence of systolic dysfunction was detected in diabetic dogs. No significant difference in plasma cTnI, Gal-3, and NT-proBNP concentrations was found between the two groups. Conclusions: Echocardiographic changes suggested that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was detected in diabetic dogs without changes in the concentration of cardiac biomarkers including cTnI, Gal-3, and NT-proBNP compared with the age- and breed-matched control dogs."
"Quinolone-resistant phenotype of Flavobacterium columnare isolates harbouring point mutations both in gyrA and parC but not in gyrB or parE  2018 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and CancerObjectives: The aim of this study was to determine mutations associated with a quinolone-resistant (QR) phenotype of Flavobacterium columnare isolates. Methods: The susceptibility of 53 F. columnare isolates to 11 antimicrobials, including 2 quinolones, was investigated by the disk diffusion method. Oxolinic acid (OXO) was subsequently chosen for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Sequence analysis of four genes within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of OXO-resistant F. columnare compared with susceptible isolates was subsequently performed. Results: The disk diffusion assay revealed that the majority of isolates were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials. However, 14 and 8 isolates were resistant to the quinolone antibiotics OXO and nalidixic acid, respectively. No multidrug resistance was observed. The MIC assay revealed five additional isolates that were resistant to OXO (≥4 μg/mL), making a total of 19 OXO-resistant isolates observed in this study. DNA sequencing identified missense mutations both in parC and gyrA but not in gyrB or parE in QR F. columnare isolates. Mutation in parC resulted in the change His87 → Tyr. For gyrA, 15 isolates of Thai origin exhibited a change at residue Ser83 to either Phe, Tyr or Ala, whereas 3 Vietnamese isolates contained two mutation sites (Ser83 → Phe and Asp87 → Tyr). Conclusion: This study is the first to reveal that QR phenotype F. columnare isolates harboured missense mutations both in parC and gyrA but not in gyrB or parE of the QRDRs."
"Mechanistic aspect based on the role of reactive oxidizing species (ROS) in macroscopic level on the glycerol photooxidation over defected and defected-free TiO2  2018 Elsevier B.V.The activity of commercial (defected-free) TiO2 and black (defected) TiO2 photocatalysts was comparatively tested in the glycerol photooxidation reaction. The preliminary results demonstrated that similar compounds, including glyceraldehyde (GCD), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glycolic acid (GCOA), formaldehyde (FMD) and glycolaldehyde (GCAD), were generated from the photocatalytic oxidation of glycerol via both photocatalysts, but they differed in their yields. The black TiO2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity to convert glycerol than the commercial TiO2, due to the presence of some defective structure and its low band gap energy, and also promoted the generation of GCAD as the main product. In contrast, the commercial TiO2 promoted the formation of GCD as the major product. The principle reactive oxidizing species (ROS) contributing for glycerol conversion via black TiO2 can be ranked in the order of O2 •->O12>OHb •>h+/OHs •>h+. The dominate ROS related to the conversion of glycerol to GCD and DHA were O2 •- and OHb •, respectively. The main ROS to alter GCD and DHA to GCAD/FMD was O2 •-, while the h+ was the principle ROS to convert GCD to GCOA. Finally, the pathway of glycerol conversion and product distribution over black TiO2 via various ROS in the presence of oxygen as electron acceptor is proposed."
"The crucial role of density functional nonlocality and on-axis CH3NH3 rotation induced I2 formation in hybrid organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbI3 cubic perovskite  2018, The Author(s).Effects of electronic nonlocality in density functional theory study of structural and energetic properties of a pseudocubic CH3NH3PbI3 are investigated by considering coherent rotation around C–N axis of a CH3NH3 cation. A number of truly non-local and semi-local exchange correlation density functionals are examined by comparing calculated structural parameters with experimental results. The vdW-DF-cx which takes into account the non-local van der Waals correlation and consistent exchange shows the best overall performance for density functional theory study of this system. Remarkable distinctions between results from vdW-DF-cx and those from PBEsol exchange correlation functionals are observed and indicate the need of including the non-local interaction in the study of this system, especially its dynamical properties. The obtained rotational barriers are 18.56 meV/formula and 27.71 meV/formula which correspond to rotational frequencies of 3.71 THz and 2.60 THz for vdW-DF-cx and PBEsol calculations, respectively. Interestingly, the maximally localised Wannier function analysis shows the hydrogen bonding assisted covalent character of two iodide anions at a moderate rotational angle which can lead to I2 formation and then material degradation."
"High tissue eosinophilia as a marker to predict recurrence for eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis  2018 ARS-AAOA, LLCBackground: Patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) have been shown to have greater disease severity and poorer treatment outcomes after sinus surgery. Although the inflammatory pattern of ECRS is essential to diagnosing this subtype, there is currently no consensus for diagnosis. Our aim in this study was to determine whether high tissue eosinophilia (HTE), measured as eosinophils per high-power field (eos/HPF), could be used to define ECRS based on likelihood of recurrence. Methods: Embase, Medline, and PubMed databases were searched for studies that reported HTE and recurrence in ECRS patients after surgical treatment. We used a random-effects bivariate meta-analysis to calculate summary sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) for detecting ECRS at different HTE cut-off scores using risk of recurrence as the primary outcome. Results: We identified 11 articles (n = 3183) that reported HTE associated with recurrence. A cut-off value of >55 eos/HPF showed the highest sensitivity (0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.91), specificity (0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99), and DOR (232.7; 95% CI, 91.0-595.1). Meta-regression analysis performed showed that the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies score (p = 0.1287), geographic location (p = 0.3745), follow-up time (p = 0.2879), and study design (p = 0.1865) did not affect the test accuracy. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that using eos/HPF has good diagnostic accuracy and may be a useful tool for identifying ECRS patients. Based on the results of our meta-analysis, we recommend a cut-off value of >55 eos/HPF for predicting the likelihood of recurrence of ECRS."
"Constitutive equations for vertical upward two-phase flow in rod bundle  2018 Elsevier LtdIn view of the quality assurance of two-phase flow simulations, CSAU (Code Scalability, Applicability, and Uncertainty) methodology and code V & V (Verification and Validation) have been proposed. The estimation of simulation uncertainty is indispensable in using best-estimate computational codes. A key of successful two-phase flow simulations is to use the state-of-the-art constitutive equations to close the mathematical system used in two-phase flow analyses. The advanced constitutive equations should be developed based on “physics” behind phenomena and should consider scaling parameters which enable their application beyond test conditions used for a code validation. Two-phase flow simulations in a rod bundle is important in various industrial apparatuses such as heat exchangers and nuclear reactors. Constitutive equations for two-phase flows in a vertical rod bundles have been advanced in recent five years. In view of this, this paper provides a comprehensive review of most advanced constitutive equations for two-phase flow analyses in a vertical rod bundle. The constitutive equations of two-phase flow parameters reviewed in this paper are flow regime map, void fraction, void fraction covariance and relative velocity covariance, interfacial area concentration and wall friction. In addition, an exact formulation of one-dimensional momentum equation in two-fluid model considering void fraction distribution is discussed."
"Serological evidence of duck Tembusu virus infection in free-grazing ducks, Thailand  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbHDuck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) has been reported in ducks raised in farming system since its emergence in 2010. No information is available on DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks, which are commonly raised and widespread in several Asian countries. To determine the presence of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand, retrospective serum samples collected from 1,000 free-grazing ducks during 2008–2015 were tested for DTMUV infection. Our result showed that 91 (9.10%) were positive for DTMUV neutralizing antibodies and DTMUV seropositive ducks have been detected in Thailand since 2008. To further investigate the seroprevalence and geographic distribution of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand, a cross-sectional serological survey of DTMUV was conducted in 2016. Of 1,200 free-grazing ducks in the 60 flocks from 20 provinces located in the major free-grazing duck raising areas of Thailand, 365 (30.42%) were positive for DTMUV neutralizing antibodies and 56 flocks (93.33%) had at least one DTMUV seropositive duck. Additionally, DTMUV seropositive ducks were observed in all provinces tested. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the presence of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks since 2008 and widespread DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand with a relatively high seroprevalence. These findings suggest the potential role of free-grazing ducks in the dissemination of DTMUV and highlight the necessity of systemic DTMUV surveillance in free-grazing ducks in addition to farm ducks for early detection, prevention, and control of this emerging disease."
"Evaluation of dielectric cure monitoring for in situ measurement of natural rubber vulcanization  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.A novel in situ rubber cure monitoring system (RCMS) has been developed for monitoring the progress of vulcanization based on the measurement of electrical properties. The sensors connected to an LCR meter were embedded in the compression mold and measured changes in the electrical properties of rubber during vulcanization. Frequencies ranging from 0.75 to 100 kHz were probed for capacitance and conductance, and 5 kHz frequency was found suitable for monitoring natural rubber vulcanization. The results show that capacitance during curing correlated with the time profile of torque from a moving die rheometer (MDR). The scorch time and optimum cure time obtained from MDR and RCMS were reported. The degree of cure and the cure rate from two methods were compared. Good correlations between the alternative methods were observed, supporting the potential of in situ RCMS during the vulcanization of natural rubber."
"A spectroscopic study of indigo dye in aqueous solution: A combined experimental and TD-DFT study  2018 Elsevier B.V.This study reports UV–Visible spectra and electronic structures of indigo (IG) in aqueous solution using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. In the visible region, the experimental absorption spectrum of the solution showed a broad peak with the longest wavelength of maximal absorption (λmax) value at 708 nm. For the theoretical method, a trans-IG monomer and a trans-IG bound with two water molecules (IG.2W) were optimized in the ground state using the B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 calculations with the 6-31 + G(d,p) basis set and the SCRF-CPCM model for taking solvent effect into account was also applied. Sequentially, the UV–Visible spectra and λmax of the optimized trans-IG and IG.2W models in the implicit water were simulated by the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The TD-DFT methods including BLYP, B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X, ωB97XD, LC-BLYP, and LC-ωPBE functionals without and with the D3 correction and the 6-31 + G(d,p) basis set were selected. The results pointed out that BLYP and BLYP-D3 were the best methods because they could reproduce the experimental λmax value of IG in aqueous solution. The predicted λmax values of IG.2W were almost equal to 708 nm (the experimental data), indicating that IG.2W could be responsible for optical properties of IG."
"Permian–Triassic back-arc basin development in response to Paleo-Tethys subduction, Sa Kaeo–Chanthaburi area in Southeastern Thailand  2018 International Association for Gondwana ResearchThe Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin in Southeastern Thailand developed behind the Sukhothai Arc along the western margin of the Indochina Block during the Permian to Triassic in response to the subduction of the Paleo-Tethys oceanic plate. To clarify its tectonic evolution of spreading, basin-infilling, and closure, we have investigated the provenance of its clastic sediments, the U-Pb ages of detrital zircons, the geochemistry of its basaltic rocks, and the structures in mélange. The rocks in the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin include two contrasting lithological units: the Thung Kabin Mélange, composed mainly of basaltic rocks, chert, limestone, and sandstone, along with mélange; and the Pong Nam Ron Formation, a thick succession of clastic sediments. Our observations suggest that the clastic sediments of the Pong Nam Ron Formation were deposited widely over the oceanic rocks (basaltic rocks, chert, and limestone) of the Thung Kabin Mélange. Geochemical analyses indicate that sandstones in both units (the Thung Kabin Mélange and the Pong Nam Ron Formation) are characterized by a provenance of mostly basaltic rocks. The U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from both units present similar age distributions: the youngest single-grain zircon (YSG) is early Late Triassic in age, the youngest cluster of zircons (YC1σ) is latest Permian to earliest Triassic in age, and there is a range of other Paleozoic and Proterozoic zircons. Based on these geochemical analyses and the U-Pb dating, the sandstones of both units had the same provenance. In addition, the basaltic rocks of the Thung Kabin Mélange are originated from back-arc basin basalts. These new observations have allowed us to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the basin. In the Early Permian, spreading took place in the basin accompanied by basaltic magmatism. Subsequently, corresponding to an inactive period of the Sukhothai Arc into the Middle Triassic, the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin subsided, and a deep-sea environment prevailed with the formation of Permian cherts, Permian limestones, and Middle Triassic cherts. During the Triassic, the basin was filled by clastic sediments and eventually closed. The clastic sediments were sourced directly from the back-arc basin basalts, as well as from the felsic volcanic rocks of the active Sukhothai Arc (which yield Permian to Triassic zircons), and from the continental materials of the Indochina Block (Paleozoic and Proterozoic zircons). After the closure of the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin, the discussed area was affected by the termination fault-fan related to the Mae Ping Fault Zone."
"Ultrasound evaluation of arterial anastomosis of the forehead  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Color Doppler ultrasound has a potential role as an imaging guide in aiding filler injections which are blinded procedures. Objective: This study investigated the forehead arteries and provided insight into their anastomoses. This was performed by challenging their function to provide blood through these anastomoses when the main artery was temporary occluded by compression. Methods: Three arteries were identified on each side of the forehead, the supratrochlear, the supraorbital and the superficial temporal arteries. Under ultrasound monitoring, each target artery and corresponding anastomosis was studied separately by compressions performed in a sequential and accumulative manner. Results: Data from the current study imply that accidental cannulation of either the supratrochlear artery or the supraorbital artery can cause ophthalmic artery embolization in every case recorded. If the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery is cannulated, the chance of blindness as a complication occurs in one fifth of volunteers. Anastomosis between both sides of the terminal branches of ophthalmic arteries creates the possibility of bilateral ocular complications when accidental cannulation occurs at one of these branches, especially the supratrochlear artery. Thus, injury to the supratrochlear artery carries a greater risk of complication than the supraorbital artery. Conclusion: These findings emphasize that the chance of ocular complication is less when accidental cannulation occurs at the superficial temporal artery compared with injury to the supratrochlear or the supraorbital arteries as the terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery. Ultrasound can assist in the identification and evaluation of all the arteries at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of vascular complications."
"Factorizable non-atomic copulas  2018 Elsevier B.V.Generalizing the notion of invariant sets by Darsow and Olsen, Sumetkijakan studied a subclass of singular copulas, the so-called non-atomic copulas, defined via its associated σ-algebras. It was shown that the Markov operator of every non-atomic copula is partially factorizable, i.e. it is the composition of left and right invertible Markov operators on a subspace of L1([0,1]) depending on the copula. Here, we further investigate the associated σ-algebras of the product of certain copulas and obtain (1) a sharper result on the partial factorizability of non-atomic copulas and (2) the existence and uniqueness of a completely factorizable copula that shares the same set of associated σ-algebras as that of a given non-atomic copula."
"Characterization of N-type and P-type Aluminum Antimonides on Si substrates for room-temperature optoelectronic devices  2018 Elsevier LtdTo develop Aluminum Antimonide (AlSb) -based optoelectronic devices on Si substrates, AlSb films were investigated for a good crystalline quality and suitable optical and electrical properties. Under an optimized growth condition by RF-magnetron sputtering technique, the AlSb films were grown at a sputtering power of 250 W and a pressure of 0.01 mbar in argon atmosphere and a precursor Al:Sb ratio of about 88:12. The undoped AlSb films were found to have a cubic crystal structure with (111) preferred orientation and a lattice constant of 5.9985 Å under compressive strain. For the doped AlSb samples with optimized doping contents, the AlSb:Si and AlSb:Cu films with higher compressive strain were found to have a smaller lattice constant of 5.9588 Å and 5.9667 Å respectively. Raman spectroscopy indicated strain states and lower crystalline quality induced by doping. The optical properties, analyzed by UV–Vis spectrophotometry, showed that the undoped AlSb film was transparent to IR at around 850 nm, where the doped films were transparent to IR at longer wavelengths. To evaluate the electrical properties of the AlSb films, n-type AlSb:Cu and p-type AlSb:Si films were characterized by Hall-Effect measurements. To develop AlSb-based optoelectronic devices, a PIN diode structure was grown on Si substrate. The smooth interfaces between the AlSb layers and with Si substrate were confirmed by cross-sectional TEM micrographs. Finally, I-V measurements showed diode characteristics with a turn-on voltage of about + 1.5 V for forward bias and −0.5 V for reverse bias. In summary, the AlSb-based diode structure on Si substrate had been successfully fabricated by optimized sputtering deposition. This is promising for future development of the AlSb-based optoelectronic devices."
"Cortical Bone Loss in a Spontaneous Murine Model of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by loss of T- and B-cell tolerance to autoantigens, are at increased risk for osteoporosis and fractures. Mice deficient in Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIB) exhibit spontaneous SLE and its restoration rescues the disease. To determine whether deleting FcγRIIB affects cortical bone mass and mechanical properties, we analyzed cortical bone phenotype of FcγRIIB knockouts at different ages. FACS analysis revealed that 6-month-old FcγRIIB−/− mice had increased B220lowCD138+ cells, markers of plasma cells, indicating active SLE disease. In contrast, 3-month-old FcγRIIB−/− mice did not develop the active SLE disease. µCT analysis indicated that FcγRIIB deletion did not affect cortical bone in 3-month-old mutants. However, 6- and 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males and females had osteopenic cortical bone and the severity of bone loss increased with disease duration. FcγRIIB deletion decreased cross-sectional area, cortical area, and marrow area in 6-month-old males. Cortical area and cortical thickness were decreased in 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males. Lack of FcγRIIB decreased cortical thickness without affecting cortical area in females. However, deletion of a single FcγRIIB allele was insufficient to induce cortical bone loss. The bending strength was decreased in 6- and 10-month-old FcγRIIB-deficient males compared to WT controls. A microindentation analysis demonstrated significantly decreased hardness in both 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males and females. Our data indicate that FcγRIIB contributes to the regulation of cortical bone homeostasis subsequent to SLE development and that deletion of FcγRIIB in mice leads to SLE-like disease associated with cortical bone loss and decreased bending strength and hardness."
"Cytotoxicity against cancer cells of chitosan oligosaccharides prepared from chitosan powder degraded by electrical discharge plasma  2018 Elsevier LtdChitosan oligosaccharides, which obtain from degradation of chitosan, possess some interesting molecular weight-dependent biological properties, especially anticancer activity. Therefore, the conversion of chitosan to chitosan oligosaccharides with specific molecular weight has been continuously investigated in order to find effective strategies that can achieve both economic feasibility and environmental concerns. In this study, a novel process was developed to heterogeneously degrade chitosan powder by highly active species generated by electrical discharge plasma in a dilute salt solution (0.02 M) without the addition of other chemicals. The degradation rate obtained from the proposed process was comparable to that obtained from some other methods with the addition of acids and oxidizing agents. Separation of the water-soluble degraded products containing chitosan oligosaccharides from the reaction solution was simply done by filtration. The obtained chitosan oligosaccharides were further evaluated for an influence of their molecular weights on cytotoxicity against cancer cells and the selectivity toward cancer and normal cells."
"Inhibition of amyloid fibril formation in the variable domain of λ6 light chain mutant Wil caused by the interaction between its unfolded state and epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate  2018 Elsevier B.V.Background: Light chains are abnormally overexpressed from disordered monoclonal B-cells and form amyloid fibrils, which are then deposited on the affected organ, leading to a form of systemic amyloidosis known as AL (Amyloid Light chain) amyloidosis. A green tea catechin, epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), which is thought to inhibit various amyloidoses, is a potent inhibitor of amyloid fibril formation in AL amyloidosis. Methods: An amyloidogenic variable domain in λ6 light chain mutant, Wil was incubated in the presence of EGCG. The incubation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC. The interaction between Wil and EGCG was observed by using NMR and tryptophan fluorescence. Results: EGCG inhibited the amyloid fibril formation of Wil at pH 7.5 and 42 °C. Under these conditions, most Wil populations were in the unfolded state and several chemical reactions, i.e., oxidation and/or covalent bond oligomerization could be induced by auto-oxidated EGCG. Moreover, we found that EGCG bound to the unfolded state of Wil with higher affinity (Kd = 7 μM). Conclusions: Inhibition of amyloid fibril formation of Wil was caused by 1) EGCG binding to unfolded state rather than folded state and 2) chemical modifications of Wil by auto oxidation of EGCG. General significance: In the competitive formation of amyloid fibrils and off-pathway oligomers, EGCG produces the latter immediately after it preferentially binds to the unfolded state. It may be general mechanism of EGCG inhibition for amyloidosis."
"Measurement of ballistic impact performance of fiber reinforced polybenzoxazine/polyurethane composites  2018 Elsevier LtdThe objective of this study is to measure impact performance of the composite based on glass and aramid fiber reinforced polybenzoxazine/polyurethane composites. Experimental panels were manufactured from E and S glass fiber reinforced polybenzoxazine backed by aramid fiber reinforced 80/20 polybenzoxazine/polyurethane and subjected to 7.62 × 51 mm at a velocity of 847 ± 9.1 m/s. Bases on test results the specimens did not have any perforation. Comparing the same number of ply, cone deformation on the last panel of S glass composite was significantly lower than that of specimen manufactured using E-glass composite. Such panels were tested for their resistance and the specimens completely resisted the penetration of projectiles for six shots. The numerical study of ballistic impact was undertaken to predict the ballistic limit velocity of the samples in which the value was measured to be 930 m/s. Results determined in this work indicated that such panels have an excellent ballistic characteristics to be used as raw material to manufacture body armor."
"Development of a high throughput yeast-based screening assay for human carbonic anhydrase isozyme II inhibitors  2018, The Author(s).Carbonic anhydrase (CA; EC 4.2.1.1) catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2) to bicarbonate and proton. There are 16 known isozymes of α-CA in humans, which differ widely in their kinetics, subcellular localization and tissue-specific distribution. Several disorders are associated with abnormal levels of CA, and so the inhibition of CA has pharmacological application in the treatment of many diseases. Currently, searching for novel CA inhibitors (CAI) has been performed using in vitro methods, and so their toxicity remains unknown at the time of screening. To obtain potentially safer CAIs, a screening procedure using an in vivo assay seems to have more advantages. Here, we developed a yeast-based in vivo assay for the detection of inhibitors of the human CA isozyme II (hCAII). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant deprived of its own CA (Δnce103 strain) can grow under a high CO2 condition (5% (v/v) CO2) but not at an ambient level. We constructed Δnce103 strains expressing various levels of hCAII from a plasmid harboring the hCAII gene arranged under the control of variously modified GAL1 promoter and relying on the expression of hCAII for growth under low CO2 condition. Using a multidrug-sensitive derivative of the Δnce103 strain expressing a low level of hCAII, we finally established a high throughput in vivo assay for hCAII inhibitors under a low CO2 condition. Cytotoxicity of the candidates obtained could be simultaneously determined under a high CO2 condition. However, their inhibitory activities against other CA isozymes remains to be established by further investigation."
"Nephrology nurses' perceptions of discussing sexual health issues with patients who have end-stage kidney disease  2018 European Dialysis and Transplant Nurses Association/European Renal Care AssociationBackground: Despite sexual dysfunction (SD) being common among, and affecting quality of life in people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving dialysis, sexuality is not a subject that patients and nephrology nurses usually discuss. Objective: To explore Thai nephrology nurses’ perceptions about discussing sexual health issues with patients receiving dialysis. Material and Methods: A phenomenological approach was applied and data were collected using semi-structured individual interviews. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 participants from four Southern regional hospitals in Thailand between April and June 2016. Recruitment continued until data saturation was reached. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's method. Findings: Participants were aged between 27 and 53 years: mean 42.95 (±7.62 SD). Nineteen were female and sixteen were married. Five themes emerged: (1) improving knowledge in order to enhance confidence before discussing sexuality with patients; (2) gaining patients’ trust before discussing sexuality; (3) finding an appropriate time to discuss sexuality; (4) organising a suitable setting in which to discuss sexuality and (5) feelings of appreciation for helping patients and their partners overcome their sexual health issues. Conclusion: These findings provide an understanding of Thai nurses’ perceptions about the challenges in communicating with patients experiencing ESKD regarding sexual health problems and concerns. The findings suggest that sexual health education and training would enhance the confidence of Thai nephrology nurses in initiating sexuality-related discussions with their patients."
"Effects of decongestant addition to intranasal corticosteroid for chronic rhinitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis  2018 ARS-AAOA, LLCBackground: Intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) is the most efficacious medicine for treating chronic rhinitis. A decongestant and INCS combination (INCS-D) is considered for nasal congestion that is not improved by INCS. This study aimed to investigate the effects of INCS-D on chronic rhinitis. Methods: Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Randomized controlled trials studying the effects of INCS-D vs INCS alone for treating chronic rhinitis were included. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Outcomes were nasal symptoms, disease-specific quality of life, objective tests for nasal patency, and adverse events. Results: Six studies (1071 patients) met the inclusion criteria. There were no differences between INCS-D and INCS on total nasal symptom scores (standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.09 to 0.40; p = 0.18), nasal congestion scores (SMD −0.13; 95% CI, −0.46 to 0.20; p = 0.43), and the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score (SMD −0.12; 95% CI, −0.66 to 0.42; p = 0.66). After 1 week, there were no differences on objective tests for nasal patency (acoustic rhinometry: SMD 0.04; 95% CI, −0.68 to 0.76, p = 0.91; and peak nasal inspiratory flow: SMD 0.08; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.32; p = 0.52). Adverse events were not different between INCS-D and INCS (risk ratio 1.09; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.62). Conclusion: Meta-analyses did not show benefits of topical decongestants addition to INCS. Adverse events of INCS-D were comparable with INCS."
"Simultaneous assessment of various quality attributes and shelf life of packaged bratwurst using hyperspectral imaging  2018 Elsevier LtdA simultaneous evaluation of various quality attributes of packaged bratwurst using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was developed. Changes in physicochemical (L* a* b* color values, pH and thiobarbituric acid (TBA)), microbiological (total viable counts (TVC) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB)) and sensory (color, odor and overall acceptability) characteristics of the packaged sausages were monitored during storage at 4 ± 1 °C. Reflectance spectra covering a wavelength range of 400–1000 nm of the samples were acquired using HSI. The relationships between the quality attributes and the spectroscopic reflectance were investigated using canonical correlation analysis. Among all quality attributes, L* color value, TBA, TVC, LAB, odor and overall acceptability appeared to be highly associated with the reflectance. To facilitate the HSI for rapid image acquisition and data processing, partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was employed for selection of optimal wavelengths. The selected wavelengths were then assembled into multispectral data and used as input variables to optimize the PLSR and artificial neural network models for the prediction of quality attributes of the sausage samples. The HSI technique can be used for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of the product's quality and shelf life."
"Finite element modelling of flexural behaviour of geosynthetic cementitious composite mat (GCCM)  2018 Elsevier LtdThis paper presents a finite element modelling of a new geosynthetic cementitious composite material called GCCM. The framework adopted a concept of concrete externally bonded by fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP). The existing bond-slip model was used to predict a flexural behaviour of GCCM, considering the effect of needle-punch process during manufacturing. The finite element modelling was calibrated against the experimental data of bending tests. The parameter optimisation was employed to define a set of the bond-slip model parameters. The analytical load-displacement curves predicted by the bond-slip model could agree well with those obtained from the experiments."
"Chitosan/alginate nanoparticles as a promising approach for oral delivery of curcumin diglutaric acid for cancer treatment  2018Curcumin diglutaric acid (CG) is a prodrug of curcumin that shows better solubility and antinociceptive activity compared to curcumin. To improve its properties further, CG was encapsulated into polysaccharide-based nanoparticles in this study. A chitosan/alginate nanoparticulate system was chosen for encapsulation of CG due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, mucoadhisiveness and good film formation. CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles were prepared by o/w emulsification and ionotropic gelification, with the conditions optimized using response surface methodology. A chitosan/alginate mass ratio of 0.04:1, CG concentration of 3 mg/mL and Pluronic®F127 concentration of 0.50% (w/v) were determined to be optimal for the nanoparticle preparation. FTIR and XRD confirmed encapsulation of CG into the chitosan/alginate nanoparticles. The CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles showed better stability under UV radiation and in a simulated gastrointestinal environment, compared to a CG dispersion in water. The nanoparticles showed slow cumulative release of CG in simulated gastrointestinal fluids without enzymes and in body fluid. A Weibull model of the best fit for all conditions suggested that the release pattern of CG from CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles was mainly controlled by Fickian diffusion and erosion of polymer materials. Finally, CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles showed higher in vitro cellular uptake in human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2 cells) and better anticancer activity against Caco-2, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Therefore, the CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles are a promising approach for oral administration of CG for cancer treatment."
"Ethanol as an electrolyte additive for alkaline zinc-air flow batteries  2018, The Author(s).Zinc-air flow batteries exhibit high energy density and offer several appealing advantages. However, their low efficiency of zinc utilization resulted from passivation and corrosion of the zinc anodes has limited their broad application. In this work, ethanol, which is considered as an environmentally friendly solvent, is examined as an electrolyte additive to potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous electrolyte to improve electrochemical performance of the batteries. Besides, the effects of adding different percentages of ethanol (0–50% v/v) to 8 M KOH aqueous electrolyte were investigated and discussed. Cyclic voltammograms revealed that the presence of 5–10% v/v ethanol is attributed to the enhancement of zinc dissolution and the hindrance of zinc anode passivation. Also, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that adding 5–10% v/v ethanol could effectively suppress the formation of passivating layers on the active surface of the zinc anodes. Though the addition of ethanol increased solution resistance and hence slightly decreased the discharge potential of the batteries, a significant enhancement of discharge capacity and energy density could be sought. Also, galvanostatic discharge results indicated that the battery using 10% v/v ethanol electrolyte exhibited the highest electrochemical performance with 30% increase in discharge capacity and 16% increase in specific energy over that of KOH electrolyte without ethanol."
"Environmental risk factors and nonpharmacological and nonsurgical interventions for obesity: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials  2018 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal FoundationBackground: Multiple environmental factors have been implicated in obesity, and multiple interventions, besides drugs and surgery, have been assessed in obese patients. Results are scattered across many studies and meta-analyses, and they often mix obese and overweight individuals. Materials and methods: PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched through 21 January 2017 for meta-analyses of cohort studies assessing environmental risk factors for obesity, and randomized controlled trials investigating nonpharmacological and nonsurgical therapeutic interventions for obesity. We excluded data on overweight participants. Evidence from observational studies was graded according to criteria that included the statistical significance of the random-effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of obesity cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction intervals, small-study effects and excess significance. The evidence of intervention studies for obesity was assessed with the GRADE framework. Results: Fifty-four articles met eligibility criteria, including 26 meta-analyses of environmental risk factors (166 studies) and 46 meta-analyses of nondrug, nonsurgical interventions (206 trials). In adults, the only risk factor with convincing evidence was depression, and childhood obesity, adolescent obesity, childhood abuse and short sleep duration had highly suggestive evidence. Infancy weight gain during the first year of life, depression and low maternal education had convincing evidence for association with paediatric obesity. All interventions had low or very-low-quality evidence with one exception of moderate-quality evidence for one comparison (no differences in efficacy between brief lifestyle primary care interventions and other interventions for paediatric obesity). Summary effect sizes were mostly small across compared interventions (maximum 5.1 kg in adults and 1.78 kg in children) and even these estimates may be inflated. Conclusions: Depression, obesity in earlier age groups, short sleep duration, childhood abuse and low maternal education have the strongest support among proposed risk factors for obesity. Furthermore, there is no high-quality evidence to recommend treating obesity with a specific nonpharmacological and nonsurgical intervention among many available, and whatever benefits in terms of magnitude of weight loss appear small."
"A colorimetric paper-based analytical device coupled with hollow fiber membrane liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) for highly sensitive detection of hexavalent chromium in water samples  2018 Elsevier B.V.A simple and highly sensitive procedure based on the combination of hollow fiber membrane liquid phase microextraction and a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (µPAD) was developed for pre-concentration and determination of hexavalent chromium in water samples. The hexavalent chromium was pre-concentrated using the HF-LPME technique via ion exchange or a coupled transport process through a supported ionic liquid (Aliquat 336) prior to colorimetric detection with diphenylcarbazide on the µPAD. The violet colour could be seen by the naked eye. Images from the µPADs were scanned using a commercial desktop scanner at 600 dpi resolution. ImageJ software was used for quantitative analysis by measuring the intensity values at green colour channel since it gave the best sensitivity among the RGB colour. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range 10–90 µg L-1, with a limit of detection of 3 µg L-1. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the level of hexavalent chromium spiked into natural water samples at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level, and the results were in good agreement with those obtained using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The developed method was able to improve the detection limit of the conventional µPAD, and was expected to be used for the effective analysis of hexavalent chromium in natural water."
"Detection of Aujeszky's disease virus DNA and antibody in swine oral fluid specimens  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbHAujeszky's disease virus (ADV) continues to circulate in commercial swine populations in many regions and in feral swine populations in most parts of the world, that is, ADV continues to present a risk to pork producers everywhere. Current DIVA vaccines and assays are highly effective in the control and/or eradication of ADV, but detection of wild-type ADV infection relies on testing individual pig specimens, for example, serum or muscle exudate (“meat juice”). Oral fluid specimens have been shown to be highly effective for the surveillance of a variety of swine pathogens and could offer the means to improve the efficiency of ADV surveillance in the field. In this study, the temporal patterns of ADV DNA and antibody detection in oral fluid and serum specimens were established in ADV-inoculated pigs (n = 14) using gB and gE PCRs, virus neutralization (VN) and three commercial serum antibody ELISAs (gB bELISA, gI bELISA and ADV iELISA). ADV DNA was detected in oral fluid samples (20% to 100%) from 3 to 21 days postinoculation (DPI), but not in serum. ADV antibody was detected in oral fluid specimens at DPI ≥ 10 with the gB bELISA (36% to 79%) and ADV iELISA (29% to 100%), but not the gI bELISA. These results suggest that oral fluid could be used as an alternative to individual pig sampling for ADV surveillance using PCR- and/or antibody-based assays."
"Acemannan increased bone surface, bone volume, and bone density in a calvarial defect model in skeletally-mature rats  2018 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of ChinaBackground/purpose: Acemannan, a β-(1–4)-acetylated polymannose extracted from Aloe vera gel, has been proposed as biomaterial for bone regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acemannan in calvarial defect healing. Materials and methods: Acemannan was processed to freeze-dried sponge form and disinfected by UV irradiation. Thirty-five female Sprague–Dawley rats were used in the in vivo study. Seven-mm diameter mid-calvarial defects were created and randomly allocated into blood clot control (C), acemannan 1 mg (A1), 2 mg (A2), 4 mg (A4), and 8 mg (A8) groups (n = 7). After four weeks, the calvarial specimens were subjected to microcomputed tomography (microCT) and histopathological analysis. Results: MicroCT revealed a significant increase in bone surface and bone volume in the A1 and A2 groups, and tissue mineral density in the A4 and A8 groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Histologically, the acemannan-treated groups had denser bone matrix compared with the control group. Conclusion: Acemannan is an effective bioactive agent for bone regeneration, enhancing bone growth as assayed in two- and three-dimensions."
"Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of PenA β-lactamase in acquired Burkholderia pseudomallei β-lactam resistance  2018 The Author(s).Therapy of Burkholderia pseudomallei acute infections is largely limited to a few β-lactam antibiotics such as ceftazidime or meropenem. Although relatively rare, resistance emergence during therapy leads to treatment failures with high mortality rates. In the absence of acquired external resistance determinants in B. pseudomallei emergence of β-lactam resistance is invariably caused by mutational modification of genomically encoded factors. These include the deletion of the ceftazidime target penicillin-binding protein 3 or amino acid changes in the Class A PenA β-lactamase that expand its substrate spectrum, as well as penA gene duplication and amplification or its overexpression via transcriptional up-regulation. Evidence is presented that penA is co-transcribed with the upstream nlpD1 gene, that the transcriptional terminator for nlpD1 serves as a penA attenuator and that generation of a new promoter immediately upstream of the terminator/attenuator by a conserved G to A transition leads to anti-termination and thus constitutive PenA expression and extended β-lactam resistance. Further evidence obtained with the extensively β-lactam resistant clinical isolate Bp1651 shows that in addition to PenA overexpression and structural mutations other adaptive mechanisms contribute to intrinsic and acquired B. pseudomallei β-lactam resistance."
"A fluorometric paper-based sensor array for the discrimination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with novel salicylidene derivatives  2018 Elsevier LtdIn this paper, novel salicylidene fluorescent sensors (1, 2, and 3) were successfully synthesized by the one pot condensation reaction and coated onto filter paper to produce fluorometric paper-based sensor array. The compound 1, 2, and 3 paper-based sensor arrays exhibited rapid fluorescent signal in response to exposure to 15 different VOC vapors. A smartphone was used as an alternative device to monitor the appearance of fluorescent signals. The images photographed using the smartphone camera were analyzed for RGB values by a conventional image-processing program. The ΔRGB data set (3 fluorophores × 15 VOC vapors × 4 repeats) from fluorescent images of 15 VOC vapors analysis have been statistically categorized by using principal component analysis (PCA) into 15 clusters with 100% discriminating accuracy. The proposed sensor array showed high potential as a portable electronic nose (e-nose) system for VOC vapors discrimination."
"GRAMD1B regulates cell migration in breast cancer cells through JAK/STAT and Akt signaling  2018 The Author(s).Dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis, which is associated with high relapse risks. However, mechanisms underlying JAK/STAT signaling-mediated breast tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here, we showed that GRAMD1B expression is upregulated on IL-6 but downregulated upon treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 in the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably, Gramd1b knockdown caused morphological changes of the cells, characterized by the formation of membrane ruffling and protrusions, implicating its role in cell migration. Consistently, GRAMD1B inhibition significantly enhanced cell migration, with an increase in the levels of the Rho family of GTPases. We also found that Gramd1b knockdown-mediated pro-migratory phenotype is associated with JAK2/STAT3 and Akt activation, and that JAK2 or Akt inhibition efficiently suppresses the phenotype. Interestingly, AG490 dose-dependently increased p-Akt levels, and our epistasis analysis suggested that the effect of JAK/STAT inhibition on p-Akt is via the regulation of GRAMD1B expression. Taken together, our results suggest that GRAMD1B is a key signaling molecule that functions to inhibit cell migration in breast cancer by negating both JAK/STAT and Akt signaling, providing the foundation for its development as a novel biomarker in breast cancer."
"Metabolic variation in the pulps of two durian cultivars: Unraveling the metabolites that contribute to the flavor  2018 Elsevier LtdDurian (Durio zibethinus M.) is a major economic fruit crop in Thailand. In this study, two popular cultivars, namely Chanee and Mon Thong, were collected from three orchards located in eastern Thailand. The pulp metabolome, including 157 annotated metabolites, was explored using capillary electrophoresis-time of flight/mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS). Cultivars and harvest years had more impact on metabolite profile separation than cultivation areas. We identified cultivar-dependent metabolite markers related to durian fruit quality traits, such as nutritional value (pyridoxamine), odor (cysteine, leucine), and ripening process (aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid). Interestingly, durian fruit were found to contain high amounts of γ-glutamylcysteine (810.3 ± 257.5 mg/100 g dry weight) and glutathione (158.1 ± 80.4 mg/100 g dry weight), which act as antioxidants and taste enhancers. This metabolite information could be related to consumer preferences and exploited for durian fruit quality improvement."
"A comparative study of mango seed kernel starches and other commercial starches: the contribution of chemical fine structure to granule crystallinity, gelatinization, retrogradation, and pasting properties  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Mango seed kernels (MSK) are the waste from mango processing plants; but they still contain valuable nutrients. In this study, the physicochemical properties of starches isolated from seed kernels of three Thai mango cultivars (Namdokmai, Kaew, and Chokanan), mainly used in the industry, were characterized and compared with those of other commercial starches namely tapioca, corn, low-, and high-amylose rice. MSK starches possessed a smooth-oval shape granule with average diameter of 12.90–13.20 µm. They were higher in lipid (0.53–0.55%) and amylose (31.50–33.12%) than other starches. Amylopectin and amylose of MSK starches had a relatively low molecular weight. Amylopectin of MSK starches had higher proportion of B1 and B2 chains but lower proportion of A chain than those of other starches. These chemical properties contributed to changes in value of following properties of MSK starches: higher crystallinity (40.20–41.30%), higher gelatinization temperature (78.13–82.39 °C) and enthalpy (17.32–19.45 J/g), higher pasting temperature (81.6–84.4 °C) and peak viscosity (356.2–423.8 rapid viscoanalyzer units). Amylopectin of MSK starches also retrograded to a higher extent than that of other starches. Based on their physicochemical properties, MSK starches; especially Kaew cultivar, could be a potential source of resistant starch; particularly of RS2."
"Investigation of benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthetic pathway and its transcriptional regulation in lotus  2018 The Author(s).Lotus predominantly accumulates benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), but their biosynthesis and regulation remain unclear. Here, we investigated structural and regulatory genes involved in BIA accumulation in lotus. Two clustered CYP80 genes were identified to be responsible for the biosynthesis of bis-BIAs and aporphine-type BIAs, respectively, and their tissue-specific expression causes divergence in alkaloid component between leaf and embryo. In contrast with the common (S)-reticuline precursor for most BIAs, aporphine alkaloids in lotus leaf may result from the (S)-N-methylcoclaurine precursor. Structural diversity of BIA alkaloids in the leaf is attributed to enzymatic modifications, including intramolecular C-C phenol coupling on ring A and methylation and demethylation at certain positions. Additionally, most BIA biosynthetic pathway genes show higher levels of expression in the leaf of high-BIA cultivar compared with low-BIA cultivar, suggesting transcriptional regulation of BIA accumulation in lotus. Five transcription factors, including three MYBs, one ethylene-responsive factor, and one basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), were identified to be candidate regulators of BIA biosynthesis in lotus. Our study reveals a BIA biosynthetic pathway and its transcriptional regulation in lotus, which will enable a deeper understanding of BIA biosynthesis in plants."
"An α-1,6-and α-1,3-linked glucan produced by Leuconostoc citreum ABK-1 alternansucrase with nanoparticle and film-forming properties  2018 The Author(s).Alternansucrase catalyses the sequential transfer of glucose residues from sucrose onto another sucrose molecule to form a long chain polymer, known as ""alternan"". The alternansucrase-encoding gene from Leuconostoc citreum ABK-1 (Lcalt) was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Lcalt encoded LcALT of 2,057 amino acid residues; the enzyme possessed an optimum temperature and pH of 40 °C and 5.0, respectively, and its' activity was stimulated up to 2.4-fold by the presence of Mn2+. Kinetic studies of LcALT showed a high transglycosylation activity, with Km 32.2 ± 3.2 mM and kcat 290 ± 12 s-1. Alternan generated by LcALT (Lc-alternan) harbours partially alternating α-1,6 and α- 1,3 glycosidic linkages confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and partial hydrolysis of Lc-alternan products. In contrast to previously reported alternans, Lc-alternan can undergo self-assembly, forming nanoparticles with an average size of 90 nm in solution. At concentrations above 15% (w/v), Lc-alternan nanoparticles disassemble and form a high viscosity solution, while this polymer forms a transparent film once dried."
"Cypripedin diminishes an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in non-small cell lung cancer cells through suppression of Akt/GSK-3β signalling  2018 The Author(s).Lung cancer appears to have the highest rate of mortality among cancers due to its metastasis capability. To achieve metastasis, cancer cells acquire the ability to undergo a switch from epithelial to mesenchymal behaviour, termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Drug discovery attempts have been made to find potent compounds that will suppress EMT. Cypripedin, a phenanthrenequinone isolated from Thai orchid, Dendrobium densiflorum, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities. In this study, we found that cypripedin attenuated typical mesenchymal phenotypes, including migratory behaviour, of non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells, with a significant reduction of actin stress fibres and focal adhesion and with weakened anchorage-independent growth. Western blot analysis revealed that the negative activity of this compound on EMT was a result of the down-regulation of the EMT markers Slug, N-Cadherin and Vimentin, which was due to ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (Akt) inactivation. As a consequence, the increase in the Slug degradation rate via a ubiquitin-proteasomal mechanism was encouraged. The observation in another lung cancer H23 cell line also supported this finding, indicating that cypripedin exhibits a promising pharmacological action on lung cancer metastasis that could provide scientific evidence for the further development of this compound."
"Genome-wide association study identified new susceptible genetic variants in HLA class i region for hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma  2018 The Author(s).We have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 473 Japanese HBV (hepatitis B virus)-positive HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) patients and 516 HBV carriers including chronic hepatitis and asymptomatic carrier individuals to identify new host genetic factors associated with HBV-derived HCC in Japanese and other East Asian populations. We identified 65 SNPs with P values < 10-4 located within the HLA class I region and three SNPs were genotyped in three independent population-based replication sets. Meta-analysis confirmed the association of the three SNPs (rs2523961: OR = 1.73, P = 7.50 × 10-12; rs1110446: OR = 1.79, P = 1.66 × 10-13; and rs3094137: OR = 1.73, P = 7.09 × 10-9). We then performed two-field HLA genotype imputation for six HLA loci using genotyping data to investigate the association between HLA alleles and HCC. HLA allele association testing revealed that HLA-A ∗ 33:03 (OR = 1.97, P = 4.58 × 10-4) was significantly associated with disease progression to HCC. Conditioning analysis of each of the three SNPs on the HLA class I region abolished the association of HLA-A ∗ 33:03 with disease progression to HCC. However, conditioning the HLA allele could not eliminate the association of the three SNPs, suggesting that additional genetic factors may exist in the HLA class I region."
"The Influence of Nonionic Surfactant Adsorption on Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Oil Palm Fruit Bunch  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Nonionic surfactants have been utilized to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. However, the role of surfactant adsorption affecting enzymatic hydrolysis has not been elaborated well. In this work, nonionic surfactants differing in their molecular structures, namely the polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), the secondary alcohol ethoxylate (Tergitol 15-S-9), and the branched alcohol ethoxylate (Tergitol TMN-6), were studied for their effects on the enzymatic hydrolysis of palm fruit bunch (PFB). The PFB was pretreated with a 10% w/v sodium hydroxide solution and then hydrolyzed using the cellulase enzyme from Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 26921) at 50 °C and pH 5. The optimal conditions providing similar yields of reducing sugar required Tween 80 and Tergitol TMN-6 at 0.25% w/v, while Tergitol 15-S-9 was required at 0.1% w/v. All the surfactants improved the enzymatic conversion efficiency and reduced unproductive binding of the enzyme to lignin. In addition, the adsorption isotherm of cellulase was fit well by the Freundlich isotherm, while adsorption of the three nonionic surfactants agreed well with the Langmuir isotherm. Adsorption capacities of the three nonionic surfactants were consistent with their enhancement efficiencies in hydrolysis. The critical micelle concentration was observed as a key property of nonionic surfactant for adsorption capacity."
"Evaluation of FOCEI and SAEM Estimation Methods in Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis Using NONMEM ® Across Rich, Medium, and Sparse Sampling Data  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature. Background and Objectives: First-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) is one of the most commonly used estimation methods in nonlinear mixed effects modeling, while the stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM) is the newer estimation algorithm. This work aimed to compare the performance of FOCEI and SAEM methods when using NONMEM ® with the classical one- and two-compartment models across rich, medium, and sparse data. Methods: One- and two-compartment models of the previous studies were used to simulate data in three scenarios: rich, medium, and sparse data. For each scenario, there were 100 data sets, containing 100 individuals in each data set. Every data set was estimated with both FOCEI and SAEM methods. The simulation and estimation were performed using NONMEM ® . The completion rates, percentage of relative estimation errors (%RERs), root mean square errors (RMSEs), and runtimes were considered to assess the completion, accuracy, precision, and speed of estimation, respectively. Results: Both FOCEI and SAEM methods provided comparable completion rates, median %RERs (ranged from − 9.03 to 3.27% for FOCEI and − 9.17 to 3.27% for SAEM) and RMSEs (ranged from 0.0004 to 1.244 for FOCEI and 0.0004 to 1.131 for SAEM) for most parameters in both models across three scenarios. The run times were much shorter with FOCEI (ranged from 0.18 to 0.98 min) compared to SAEM method (ranged from 4.64 to 12.03 min). Conclusions: For the classical one- and two-compartment models, FOCEI method exhibited comparable performance similar to SAEM method but with significantly shorter runtimes across rich, medium, and sparse sampling scenarios."
"Yttrium (III) Recovery with D2EHPA in Pseudo-Emulsion Hollow Fiber Strip Dispersion System  2018 The Author(s).Yttrium (Y) is an essential lanthanide rare earth element and can be effectively extracted and purified using a hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) system. However, the stability of HFSLM system is a significant challenge. Pseudoemulsion-hollow fiber strip dispersion (PEHFSD) system, providing excellent stability, is attracting research attention. In this work, the recovery of Y(III) by PEHFSD system using di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) as a carrier was investigated. The effects of several operating parameters, including the initial concentration of Y(III) in the feed phase, the flow rate of feed, the stirring speed and the volumetric ratio of feed to strip on Y(III) separation were studied. The Y(III) transport was analyzed on the concentration ratio of Y(III) ions, percent extraction, percent stripping and overall mass transfer coefficient (K p ). The PEHFSD system outperformed HFSLM system regarding separation performance and stability. K p of HFSLM system decreased after the second run, but K p of PEHFSD system remained constant even at the fifth run. The dispersed droplets in the strip dispersion phase in the PEHFSD system enhanced separation performance and stability of the membrane module."
"Relativistic finite-difference time-domain analysis of high-speed moving metamaterials  2018 The Author(s).In this paper, we apply a relativistic finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method by using the Lorentz transformation to analyze metamaterials moving at a high speed. As an example, we consider a slab of left-handed metmaterial (LHM) with both relative permittivity and permeability equal to -1. Simulation results show that when the LHM slab moves at a high speed, its electromagnetic responses are drastically different from the static case. Specifically, when the LHM slab moves toward the source, for the case of normal incidence, there exists a special velocity at which fields experience a zero spatial phase delay through the LHM slab; while for the oblique incidence, above a certain velocity fields inside the LHM become evanescent. On the other hand, when the LHM slab moves away from the source, for the case of normal incidence, at the same special velocity the magnitudes of both electric and magnetic fields inside the LHM slab reach their minimum values; for the oblique incidence, the slab functions as a field converter. Besides, the transmitted waves through the LHM slab experience a red-shift (to a lower frequency) and the shift is proportional to the velocity of the LHM slab regardless of the moving direction."
"Novel canine circovirus strains from Thailand: Evidence for genetic recombination  2018 The Author(s).Canine circoviruses (CanineCV's), belonging to the genus Circovirus of the Circoviridae family, were detected by next generation sequencing in samples from Thai dogs with respiratory symptoms. Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of nearly complete CanineCV genomes suggested that natural recombination had occurred among different lineages of CanineCV's. Similarity plot and bootscaning analyses indicated that American and Chinese viruses had served as major and minor parental viruses, respectively. Positions of recombination breakpoints were estimated using maximum-likelihood frameworks with statistical significant testing. The putative recombination event was located in the Replicase gene, intersecting with open reading frame-3. Analysis of nucleotide changes confirmed the origin of the recombination event. This is the first description of naturally occurring recombinant CanineCV's that have resulted in the circulation of newly emerging CanineCV lineages."
"Identification of the effector domain of biglycan that facilitates BMP-2 osteogenic function  2018 The Author(s).We have reported that recombinant biglycan (BGN) core protein accelerates bone formation in vivo by enhancing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 function. The purpose of the present study was to identify the specific domain (""effector"") within the BGN core protein that facilitates BMP-2 osteogenic function. Thus, we generated various recombinant and synthetic peptides corresponding to several domains of BGN, and tested their effects on BMP-2 functions in vitro. The results demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeats 2-3 domain (LRR2-3) of BGN significantly enhanced the BMP-2 induced Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation, osteogenic gene expression, and alkaline phosphatase activity in myogenic C2C12 cells. Furthermore, addition of LRR2-3 to osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells accelerated in vitro mineralization without compromising the quality of the mineral and matrix. These data indicate that LRR2-3 is, at least in part, responsible for BGN's ability to enhance BMP-2 osteogenic function, and it could be useful for bone tissue regeneration."
"Screening cyanobacteria from marine coastal waters of Thailand for biohydrogen production  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis. H 2 can be produced by cyanobacterial bidirectional hydrogenase, but mainly during anaerobic dark fermentation. Here, we screened H 2 producing cyanobacteria isolated from marine environments in Thailand and optimized physiological conditions for maximizing H 2 production of the selected isolate. Most of the 54 cyanobacterial strains isolated and purified from samples of seawater, stones, sand, and shells in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea, southern part of Thailand produced H 2 when cells were incubated in nitrogen-deprived medium under dark/anaerobic condition. The filamentous non-heterocystous cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. RMK-SH10 gave the highest H 2 yield with highest H 2 production rate found in 7-day grown cells. Geitlerinema sp. RMK-SH10 showed maximum H 2 production rate of 0.271 ± 0.013 μmol H 2 mg −1 dry weight h −1 when incubated in NaNO 3 -free ASN III medium containing 0.2 M NaCl, 18.9 mmol C-atom of glucose L −1 , and 0.1 μM Ni 2+ . These results suggest that the marine filamentous cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. RMK-SH10 has high potential as a H 2 producer amenable for further improvement by genetic manipulation."
"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy of ginger in the prevention of abdominal distention in post cesarean section patients  2018 The Author(s).The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ginger in the prevention of abdominal distention in post cesarean section patients. A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted. One hundred and seventy-eight post cesarean section patients were either randomized to the study group receiving oral ginger capsules or to the placebo group receiving oral placebo capsules. The average age of the studied women was 32.3 years. The incidence of postoperative abdominal distention was not different between the ginger and the placebo groups (20.2% vs 29.2%, p = 0.328). The efficacy to relieve abdominal distention was superior in the ginger group than the placebo group (91% vs 65.2%, p < 0.001). With regards to quality of life, the number of patients who had the ability to eat was higher in the ginger group than in the placebo group (59.6% vs 43.8%, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in time to first flatus, maternal satisfaction, and side effects. Ginger does not decrease the incidence of post cesarean section abdominal distention. But, ginger is more effective than the placebo in relieving the severity of abdominal distention on the fourth day after operation and improving the ability to eat."
"Prevalence and risk factors of depression among Indonesian elderly: A nursing home-based cross-sectional study  2018Background: The burden of depressive elderly is high globally. However, nursing home-based studies on prevalence and risk factors of depression are scarce due to feasibility and difficulties in data collection. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted at three nursing homes (NHs) in three districts in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. A total of 181 elderly NH residents aged ≥60 were recruited purposively. Information regarding socio-demographics, health-related characteristics and social support among respondents were collected by a modified questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. A short form Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Indonesian version was employed to assess levels of depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the data. Results: Overall, the prevalence of geriatric depression was assessed to be at 42.5% (31.5% in women and 11% in men). Risk factors that were found to be significantly associated with depression in the univariate analysis were female, none or lack of social support, had ≥3 chronic diseases, and perceived inadequacy of care. In the multivariate analysis, perceived inadequacy of care remained significant risk factor for depression amongst the elderly NH residents. Limitations: Besides a number of important variables were determined by self-report, the used sampling technique was purposive. In addition, the elderly who had severe cognitive impairment or dementia and were not able to communicate meaningfully were excluded from this study. Conclusions: The prevalence rates of depression were relatively high among elderly NH residents in our study area. Adequate health services are needed in order to reduce the risk of depression among elderly NH residents."
"MitoQ supplementation prevent long-term impact of maternal smoking on renal development, oxidative stress and mitochondrial density in male mice offspring  2018 The Author(s).To investigate the effect of maternal MitoQ treatment on renal disorders caused by maternal cigarette smoke exposure (SE). We have demonstrated that maternal SE during pregnancy increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult offspring. Mitochondrial oxidative damage contributes to the adverse effects of maternal smoking on renal disorders. MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that has been shown to protect against oxidative damage-related pathologies in many diseases. Female Balb/c mice (8 weeks) were divided into Sham (exposed to air), SE (exposed to cigarette smoke) and SEMQ (exposed to cigarette smoke with MitoQ supplemented from mating) groups. Kidneys from the mothers were collected when the pups weaned and those from the offspring were collected at 13 weeks. Maternal MitoQ supplementation during gestation and lactation significantly reversed the adverse impact of maternal SE on offspring's body weight, kidney mass and renal pathology. MitoQ administration also significantly reversed the impact of SE on the renal cellular mitochondrial density and renal total reactive oxygen species in both the mothers and their offspring in adulthood. Our results suggested that MitoQ supplementation can mitigate the adverse impact of maternal SE on offspring's renal pathology, renal oxidative stress and mitochondrial density in mice offspring."
"Bio-composite hydrogels of cellulose and vulcanized natural rubber with nanointerconnected layers for reinforced water-retaining materials  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The bio-composite hydrogels consisting of cellulose and vulcanized natural rubber (VNR) were successfully prepared by phase inversion. The hydrogel preparation of cellulose and VNR was performed by mixing a cellulose solution in 6 wt% lithium chloride in N,N-dimethylacetamide with VNR in toluene at a 10, 15 and 20 wt% VNR loading level. The solution was then exposed to ethanol vapor for 1 day. The cellulose–VNR composites at 10–20 wt% VNR showed an excellent reinforcement, in terms of higher elastic and mechanical properties, even though the composite hydrogels retained a high amount of water (about 870–2400%). The nanosize morphology of the composite hydrogels indicated that the roughly aggregated VNR found in the cellulose medium formed with an interconnection layer between both the cellulose and VNR components, where the VNR was surrounded with fibrous cellulose medium. The resulting interconnection between the hydrophobic VNR and hydrophilic cellulose domains at higher VNR-loading levels enhanced the mechanical and elasticity properties of the bio-composite hydrogels."
"Genetic homogeneity of goat malaria parasites in Asia and Africa suggests their expansion with domestic goat host  2018 The Author(s).Plasmodium was first identified in a goat in Angola in 1923, and only recently characterized by DNA isolation from a goat blood sample in Zambia. Goats were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent approximately 10,000 years ago, and are now globally distributed. It is not known if the Plasmodium identified in African goats originated from parasites circulating in the local ungulates, or if it co-evolved in the goat before its domestication. To address this question, we performed PCR-based surveillance using a total of 1,299 goat blood samples collected from Sudan and Kenya in Africa, Iran in west Asia, and Myanmar and Thailand in southeast Asia. Plasmodium DNA was detected from all locations, suggesting that the parasite is not limited to Africa, but widely distributed. Whole mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed that there was only one nucleotide substitution between Zambian/Kenyan samples and others, supporting the existence of a goat-specific Plasmodium species, presumably Plasmodium caprae, rather than infection of goats by local ungulate malaria parasites. We also present the first photographic images of P. caprae, from one Kenyan goat sample."
"Cyperenoic acid suppresses osteoclast differentiation and delays bone loss in a senile osteoporosis mouse model by inhibiting non-canonical NF-κB pathway  2018 The Author(s).Cyperenoic acid is a terpenoid isolated from the root of a medicinal plant Croton crassifolius with a wide range of biological activities. In this study, the effects of cyperenoic acid on osteoclast differentiation were investigated both in vitro and in vivo using receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced bone marrow-derived osteoclasts and senescence-accelerated mouse prone 6 (SAMP6). Cyperenoic acid significantly suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation at the concentrations with no apparent cytotoxicity. The half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) for osteoclast differentiation was 36.69 μM ± 1.02. Cyperenoic acid treatment evidently reduced the expression of two key transcription factors in osteoclast differentiation, NFATc1 and c-Fos. Detailed signaling analysis revealed that cyperenoic acid did not affect MAPK pathways and canonical NF-κB pathway but impaired activation of p100/p52 in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway upon RANKL stimulation. Moreover, the expression of osteoclast-related genes, nfatc1, ctsk, irf8, acp5 and cfos were disrupted by cyperenoic acid treatment. The bone resorption activity by cyperenoic acid-treated osteoclasts were impaired. In a senile osteoporosis mouse model SAMP6, mice fed on diet supplemented with cyperenoic acid showed delay in bone loss, compared to the control. Taken together, plant-derived cyperenoic acid shows great potential as therapeutic agent for osteoporosis."
"The Compensatory Immune-Regulatory Reflex System (CIRS) in Depression and Bipolar Disorder  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Here, we review a novel concept namely the compensatory immune-regulatory reflex system (CIRS) as applied to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). There is evidence that a substantial subset of individuals with MDD and BD exhibit an activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), as indicated by an increased production of macrophagic M1 and T helper (Th)-1 pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 trans-signaling, positive acute phase proteins (APPs), and complement factors. These immune aberrations appear to be evident during the course of major affective episodes of either depressive or (hypo) manic polarity. Here, we review (a) the current state of the art of CIRS functions in both mood disorders and (b) the possible role of CIRS-related biomarkers for the understanding of affective disorders within the framework of precision psychiatry that could also provide novel drug targets for both MDD and BD. CIRS-related abnormalities in mood disorders include elevated Th-2 and T regulatory (Treg) activities with increased IL-4 and IL-10 production, classical IL-6 signaling, increased levels of sIL-1R antagonist (sIL-1RA), soluble IL-2 (sIL-2R) and tumor necrosis factor–α- receptors, and positive APPs, including haptoglobin, hemopexin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α1-antitrypsin, and ceruloplasmin. It is concluded that CIRS is involved in MDD and BD by regulating the primary immune-inflammatory response, thereby contributing to spontaneous and antidepressant-promoted recovery from the acute phase of illness. Signs of activated IRS and CIRS pathways are observed in the remitted phases of both disorders indicating that there is no return to the original homeostasis after an acute episode, while later episodes of mood disorders are characterized by sensitized IRS and CIRS responses. New z-unit weighted composite biomarker scores are proposed, which reflect different aspects of IRS versus CIRS activation and may be used to estimate different IRS/CIRS activity ratios in mood and other neuroimmune disorders."
Structural prediction of host-guest structure in lithium at high pressure  2018 The Author(s).Ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) technique is used to identify the high-pressure phases of lithium (Li). We proposed the transition mechanism from the fcc to host-guest (HG) structures at finite temperature and high pressure. This complex structural phase transformation has been calculated using ab initio lattice dynamics with finite displacement method which confirms the dynamical harmonic stabilization of the HG structure. The electron distribution between the host-host atoms has also been investigated by electron localization function (ELF). The strongly localized electron of p bond has led to the stability of the HG structure. This remarkable result put the HG structure to be a common high-pressure structure among alkali metals.
"The Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Neuroprogressive Diseases: Emerging Pathophysiological Role and Translational Implications  2018, The Author(s).The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main cellular organelle involved in protein synthesis, assembly and secretion. Accumulating evidence shows that across several neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive diseases, ER stress ensues, which is accompanied by over-activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although the UPR could initially serve adaptive purposes in conditions associated with higher cellular demands and after exposure to a range of pathophysiological insults, over time the UPR may become detrimental, thus contributing to neuroprogression. Herein, we propose that immune-inflammatory, neuro-oxidative, neuro-nitrosative, as well as mitochondrial pathways may reciprocally interact with aberrations in UPR pathways. Furthermore, ER stress may contribute to a deregulation in calcium homoeostasis. The common denominator of these pathways is a decrease in neuronal resilience, synaptic dysfunction and even cell death. This review also discusses how mechanisms related to ER stress could be explored as a source for novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive diseases. The design of randomised controlled trials testing compounds that target aberrant UPR-related pathways within the emerging framework of precision psychiatry is warranted."
"Analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome of the giant honeybee, Apis dorsata, (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Thailand  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The giant honeybee, Apis dorsata, is a species native to the East Asian continent and some islands of Sundaland and the Philippines. We analyzed, for the first time, the complete mitochondrial genome of A. dorsata from Thailand using next generation sequencing. The mitochondrial genome was found to be a circular molecule of 15,279 bp in length, which consisted of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and an AT rich region. Start codons ATA, ATG and ATT were found in two, three and ten genes, respectively, while stop codons TAA and TAG were observed in 12 and 1 gene, respectively. All tRNA genes formed typical cloverleaf secondary structures, except for His (H) and Tyr (Y). The heavy (H)-strand was found to have nine PCGs and 14 tRNA genes, while the light (L)-strand was found to contain four protein-coding, eight tRNA, and two rRNA genes."
"Polygonumins A, a newly isolated compound from the stem of Polygonum minus Huds with potential medicinal activities  2018 The Author(s).Polygonumins A, a new compound, was isolated from the stem of Polygonum minus. Based on NMR results, the compound's structure is identical to that of vanicoside A, comprising four phenylpropanoid ester units and a sucrose unit. The structure differences were located at C-3″″′. The cytotoxic activity of polygonumins A was evaluated on several cancer cell lines by a cell viability assay using tetrazolium dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The compound showed the highest antiproliferative (p < 0.05) activities against K562 (Human Leukaemia Cell Line), MCF7 (Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), and HCT116 (Colorectal cancer cells) cells. Cytotoxic studies against V79-4 cells were carried out and showed that polygonumins A was toxic at 50 μg/ml, suggesting that this compound may be used as an anticancer drug without affecting normal cells. Polygonumins A also showed promising activity as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with 56% relative inhibition. Molecular docking results indicated that the compound possesses high binding affinity towards the HIV protease over the low binding free energy range of -10.5 to -11.3 kcal/mol. P. minus is used in Malaysian traditional medicine for the treatment of tumour cells. This is the first report on the use of P. minus as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor."
"The High-Pressure Superconducting Phase of Arsenic  2018 The Author(s).Ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) technique is predicted a stable structure of arsenic (As). We find that the body-centered tetragonal (bct) structure with spacegroup I41/acd to be the stable structure at high pressure. Our calculation suggests transition sequence from the simple cubic (sc) structure transforms into the host-guest (HG) structure at 41 GPa and then into the bct structure at 81 GPa. The bct structure has been calculated using ab initio lattice dynamics with finite displacement method confirm the stability at high pressure. The spectral function α2 F of the bct structure is higher than those of the body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. It is worth noting that both bct and bcc structures share the remarkable similarity of structural and property. Here we have reported the prediction of temperature superconductivity of the bct structure, with a T c of 4.2 K at 150 GPa."
"The model of circulating immune complexes and interleukin-6 improves the prediction of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus  2018 The Author(s).Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease resulting in autoantibody production, immune complex deposition, and complement activation. The standard biomarkers such as anti-dsDNA and complements (C3 and C4) do not always correlate with active clinical SLE. The heterogeneity of SLE patients may require additional biomarkers to designate disease activity. Ninety SLE patients participated in this study. Evaluation of disease activity was achieved with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and modified SLEDAI-2K. The measured serum biomarkers were anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, ESR, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and circulating immune complexes (CIC). IL-6, ESR and CIC significantly increased in active clinical SLE. Complement, anti-dsDNA, ESR and CIC correlated with SLEDAI-2K while only anti-dsDNA, CIC, ESR and IL-6 correlated with modified SLEDAI-2K. A combination of biomarkers gave a higher odds ratio (OR) than any single biomarker. A combination of IL-6 or CIC exhibited the highest OR (OR = 7.27, 95%CI (1.99-26.63), p = 0.003) while either complement or anti-dsDNA showed a moderate odds ratio (OR = 3.14, 95%CI (1.16-8.48), p = 0.024) of predicting clinical active SLE. The combination of CIC and IL-6 strongly predicts active clinical SLE. CIC and IL-6 can be used in addition to standard biomarkers to determine SLE activity."
"Oxidized Carbon Black: Preparation, Characterization and Application in Antibody Delivery across Cell Membrane  2018 The Author(s).Modulating biomolecular networks in cells with peptides and proteins has become a promising therapeutic strategy and effective biological tools. A simple and effective reagent that can bring functional proteins into cells can increase efficacy and allow more investigations. Here we show that the relatively non-toxic and non-immunogenic oxidized carbon black particles (OCBs) prepared from commercially available carbon black can deliver a 300 kDa protein directly into cells, without an involvement of a cellular endocytosis. Experiments with cell-sized liposomes indicate that OCBs directly interact with phospholipids and induce membrane leakages. Delivery of human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs, 150 kDa) with specific affinity towards dengue viruses (DENV) into DENV-infected Vero cells by OCBs results in HuMAbs distribution all over cells' interior and effective viral neutralization. An ability of OCBs to deliver big functional/therapeutic proteins into cells should open doors for more protein drug investigations and new levels of antibody therapies and biological studies."
"One-pot synthesis of wormhole-like mesostructured silica with a high amine loading for enhanced adsorption of clofibric acid  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.A series of ordered amine-functionalized hexagonal mesoporous silicas (HMS-NH2) were synthesized successfully via direct co-condensation using dodecylamine as a structure-directing agent in the presence of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS), [aminoethylamino]propyltrimethoxysilane or [(2-aminoethylamino)ethylamino]propyltrimethoxysilane (AEEA) as amine group precursors. Tetrahydrofuran was used as the organic solvent to control the interaction and sol–gel reaction of the silica source and aminosilanes. The effect of the type and concentration of the added aminosilanes on the physicochemical properties of the resulting HMS-NH2 materials were investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and solid-state 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed a successful functionalization of the HMS surface with different amine groups. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy indicated that their wormhole-like mesostructured framework was retained after functionalization at a high APS loading level (15 mol%) or using AEEA as the aminosilane precursor. A high degree (88–98%) of aminosilanes was incorporated into the HMS framework, corresponding to an amine concentration of 0.72–2.16 mmol g−1. The HMS-NH2 materials had a high surface area (272–627 m2 g−1), a large total pore volume (0.48–1.92 cm3 g−1) and exhibited an enhanced adsorption capacity for clofibric acid in aqueous solution."
"Intelligent monitoring and prediction of tool wear in CNC turning by utilizing wavelet transform  2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.In order to realize an intelligent CNC machine, this research proposed the in-process tool wear monitoring system regardless of the chip formation in CNC turning by utilizing the wavelet transform. The in-process prediction model of tool wear is developed during the CNC turning process. The relations of the cutting speed, the feed rate, the depth of cut, the decomposed cutting forces, and the tool wear are investigated. The Daubechies wavelet transform is used to differentiate the tool wear signals from the noise and broken chip signals. The decomposed cutting force ratio is utilized to eliminate the effects of cutting conditions by taking ratio of the average variances of the decomposed feed force to that of decomposed main force on the fifth level of wavelet transform. The tool wear prediction model consists of the decomposed cutting force ratio, the cutting speed, the depth of cut, and the feed rate, which is developed based on the exponential function. The new cutting tests are performed to ensure the reliability of the tool wear prediction model. The experimental results showed that as the cutting speed, the feed rate, and the depth of cut increase, the main cutting force also increases which affects in the escalating amount of tool wear. It has been proved that the proposed system can be used to separate the chip formation signals and predict the tool wear by utilizing wavelet transform even though the cutting conditions are changed."
"Rare zooxanthellate Nanipora octocoral (Helioporacea) in the Gulf of Thailand  2017, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.The octocoral Nanipora kamurai is the fifth species of octocoral described with an aragonite skeleton. So far, it has only been known from a single location in Okinawa, Japan. Here, we report on the second recorded location of the genus Nanipora, in the Gulf of Thailand, where its colonies were found in relatively high densities. A total of 143 separate Nanipora colonies were counted in transects on a coral reef at Koh Tao, Thailand. They were found living on dead coral skeletons and on the shell of a living Tridacna squamosa clam. Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and mitochondrial mismatch repair protein (mtMutS) sequences showed that they belong to N. kamurai or to a close relative of this species. Additionally, a symbiotic relationship with Symbiodinium was observed for the first time in Nanipora, confirmed by sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) of the dinoflagellate."
"THE great transition: Implications from environmental policy for the quality-quantity trade-off in children-rearing  2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.We develop an overlapping-generations model with human capital accumulation and endogenous fertility containing a pollution externality. We study the effects of an environmental policy on individuals' quality-quantity trade-off on children. In a Malthusian poverty trap, we show that a more stringent policy induces a reduction of fertility. In a state of perpetual development, we find a similar result and show that higher environmental quality, growth and welfare are compatible goals. Moreover, we show that the policy can be used as an instrument for initiating a country's great transition from a state of poverty to a state of development."
"An integrative identification guide to the Hydrozoa (Cnidaria) of Bocas del Toro, Panama  2018,  2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This work is the first attempt to assess the biodiversity of the Hydrozoa in the Archipiélago de Bocas del Toro (Panamá, Caribbean Sea) using morphology and molecular taxonomy, and to produce field identification tools to help future identification and monitoring efforts in the area. We sampled, identified, vouchered, and barcoded 112 specimens of Hydrozoa from shallow coastal waters (0–22 m depth) in the Archipiélago de Bocas del Toro. The specimens belong to 70 taxa, of which 53 were identified at the species level, and 17 were identified at the genus or family level. We produced 64 sequences of the large ribosomal subunit of the mitochondrial RNA (mt lsu-rRNA, 16S), the genetic marker generally used for barcoding Hydrozoa. We updated the local checklist that now comprises 118 species, and produced 87 detailed taxon identification tables that display species descriptions augmented with pictures, geographic distribution (worldwide and in Bocas del Toro), GenBank accession numbers for the 16S mitochondrial gene, and a synopsis of the families they belong to."
"Factors associated with death acceptance among thai patients with advanced cancer  2018, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative. All rights reserved.Patients with advanced cancer cope with various issues, especially psychological symptoms, such as anxiety about death. Previous research from various countries indicates that most advanced cancer patients perceive distress before death, which means they cannot accept death peacefully. The purpose of this study was to examine the factors associated with death acceptance of Thai patients with advanced cancer. The participants were 242 adult patients with advanced cancer from three tertiary hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand. The research instruments consisted of 7 questionnaires: a personal information questionnaire, the death anxiety questionnaire, Buddhist beliefs about death questionnaire, the unfinished task questionnaire, general self-efficacy scale, family relationship questionnaire, and death acceptance scale. These instruments were tested for their content validity by a panel of experts. All instruments except the first one were tested for reliability, and their Cronbach's alpha coefficient were .86, .72, .74, .74, .89, and .70, respectively. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation, Point-biserial correlation coefficient, and stepwise multiple regression were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that a total of 42% of variance of death acceptance among Thai patients with advanced cancer was explained by death anxiety, Buddhist beliefs about death, and self-efficacy. Knowing these factors provides further information for nurses to help patients to cope with their death. From this crucial knowledge, nurses can develop interventions in decreasing or controlling anxiety about death, promoting Buddhist beliefs about death, and enhancing self-efficacy of advanced cancer patients. Therefore, a better quality of life and good death can be achieved."
"Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of TTP: An integrated approach  2018 American Society of Hematology. All rights reserved.Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening disease with an incidence of approximately 2 persons per million per year. It is characterized by severe deficiency of the von Willebrand cleaving protease, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), leading to formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature. Prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, particularly plasma exchange, may be life-saving. Diagnosis of TTP is challenging because of its diverse clinical manifestations, overlap in clinical presentation with other thrombotic microangiopathies, and limited availability of ADAMTS13 testing. Clinical prediction scores have been developed to estimate the pretest probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and may be used as an adjunct to clinical judgment to guide initial management decisions. An ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 10% supports the diagnosis of TTP in appropriate clinical contexts, but many centers do not offer testing in-house and must send out the test to a reference laboratory with a turnaround time of several days. In such instances, initial management decisions must be made without the benefit of laboratory testing. In patients with TTP, inhibitor tests may be useful for distinguishing immune-mediated from congenital TTP. In this article, we review the epidemiology, natural history, and clinical presentation of TTP and laboratory assays for TTP including ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor assays. We also describe an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected TTP that integrates clinical and laboratory assessment."
"Regulation of periostin expression by Notch signaling in hepatocytes and liver cancer cell lines  2018 Elsevier Inc.Notch signaling is involved in both differentiation of hepatocyte progenitors and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanism whereby Notch signaling regulates cellular transformation in hepatocytes is still controversial. This study investigated the impact of overexpressing truncated intracellular Notch1 (NICD1) on transcriptomic profiles of immortalized human hepatocytes. RNA sequencing and gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that extracellular matrix organization and hyaluronan biosynthesis process gene sets are among those affected by Notch hyperactivation. The relationship between Notch signaling and periostin, an extracellular matrix protein highly expressed in HCC, were further studied. Modulating Notch signaling through NICD1 overexpression or treatment with a gamma secretase inhibitor resulted in increased or decreased periostin expression, respectively, in HCC and liver bile duct carcinoma cell lines. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database, mRNA levels of NOTCH1 and POSTN are positively correlated in tumor tissues but not in nontumor tissues. Two consensus RBPJ binding motifs were identified in the −3932/-3921 and + 2522/+2533 bp of POSTN regulatory regions, and NOTCH1 is associated with these binding sites in a liver bile duct carcinoma cell line. Taken together, these results indicate that Notch signaling directly regulates transcription of POSTN in hepatocytes and liver cancer cell lines and may be a candidate for drug targeting in liver cancer."
"Evidence for the Associated Production of a Single Top Quark and a Photon in Proton-Proton Collisions at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.The first evidence of events consistent with the production of a single top quark in association with a photon is reported. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV and recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. Events are selected by requiring the presence of a muon (μ), a photon (γ), an imbalance in transverse momentum from an undetected neutrino (ν), and at least two jets (j) of which exactly one is identified as associated with the hadronization of a b quark. A multivariate discriminant based on topological and kinematic event properties is employed to separate signal from background processes. An excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed, with a significance of 4.4 standard deviations. A fiducial cross section is measured for isolated photons with transverse momentum greater than 25 GeV in the central region of the detector. The measured product of the cross section and branching fraction is σ(pp→tγj)B(t→μνb)=115±17(stat)±30(syst) fb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction."
"Analysis of socioeconomic and behavioral factors influencing participation in community-based recycling program: A case of peri-urban town in Thailand  2018 by the authors.This study analyzed the factors influencing a community-based waste recycling program to achieve a recycling rate 5-11 times/members higher than average community-based recycling programs in Thailand. This study identified key factors and insights from waste bank members to provide recommendations for improving the performance of other community-based programs. A face-to-face survey was conducted in Phang Khon Municipality (PKM), Thailand, where the waste bank is situated. A total of 386 questionnaires were analyzed by descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression analysis. The investigation tested how selected variables, such as socioeconomic factors, attitude toward sound waste management practices, types of waste separation, and additional willingness to pay for improving the waste management system, have an influence on different groups of recyclers and impact recycling performance. The findings revealed that members of the waste bank have different socioeconomic and pro-recycling characteristics, i.e., attitude toward proper waste management practices, recycling practice, and additional willingness to pay for improving the waste management system, compared to respondents who recycle through direct waste selling, and who do not recycle. Based on key factor findings in this study, policy recommendation for waste management entities are provided."

"Thin cloud removal using local minimization and logarithm image transformation in HSI color space  2018 IEEE.In observation of land information using satellite images, clouds are one of the most serious obstacles due to their opacity property which can block the visibility of ground objects and can also be blended with the underlying details. Hence, retrieval the actual information covered by clouds is frequently necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel method to remove clouds by taking an advantage of HSI color space instead of directly removing clouds in RGB color space. The proposed method uses a concept of dark channel prior method to estimate the cloud appearance called the scattering light and perform a subtraction in only the intensity channel to avoid an effect to the original color and also enhance the intensity with gamma correction to recover some information accidentally removed from the previous step and restore obscure details distorted by clouds. Furthermore, since clouds involve in both intensity and saturation channel, we increase the saturation that was reduced as a result from clouds by using logarithm image transformation as well. From the results, the proposed method can remove clouds that are not extremely opaque and preserve the actual information such as color and texture due to the higher contrast gain in the experiments comparing to the results obtained from other single-image methods."

"Magnetization of NdFeB Permanent Magnet Considering Demagnetization Effect  2018 KIEE EMECS (KIEE Electrical Machinery and Energy Conversion Systems).Electrical machine efficiency improvement has been paid more attention over the past years. Using Permanent Magnets (PMs) in various modern electrical machines is one of the most favorable approaches to increase machine efficiency. However, PMs still have a significant disadvantage that is the demagnetization issue. Therefore, these demagnetized PMs need to magnetize for regaining their initial capability considering the demagnetization level. Therefore, first of all, this paper proposes the demagnetization behavior of NdFeB PMs due to thermal effect. Then, these PMs are magnetized using a proposed simple magnetizing technique considering various demagnetization conditions. Finally, the results indicate that the most complete demagnetized PMs are able to significantly recover to their initial capability."
"Demonstration of Photovoltaic Effects in Hybrid Type-I InAs/GaAs Quantum Dots and Type-II GaSb/GaAs Quantum Dots  2018 IEEE.We fabricate hybrid quantum dot (QD) solar cells by combining type-I InAs/GaAs QDs and type-II GaSb/ GaAs QDs, where the benefits of strong light absorption of type-I QDs and long carrier lifetime of type-II QDs are combined in a single device by using molecular beam epitaxy. We confirm the processes of photon absorption and emission by type-I QDs and reabsorption by type-II QDs by investigating their photoluminescence properties. The photovoltaic effects in such hybrid QD solar cells are also demonstrated. Our hybrid QD nanostructures would find potential applications in high efficiency QD-based solar cells operating under concentrated sunlight."
"Liquid-Phase Sintering and Properties of PIMed 10-20 vol.% SiCp-Reinforced Aluminium Composites  2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.Liquid-phase sintering and properties of powder injection moulded aluminium composite reinforced with SiCp has been investigated via thermal-phase analyses and hardness property. Mixing of 10 and 20 vol.% SiCp and aluminium powder was done via ball milling prior to feedstock preparation at 55% solid loading. Powder injection moulding was carried out at 170°C, followed by solvent and thermal debinding. The brown samples were sintered in a nitrogen atmosphere at 650-660°C, prior to age-hardening. Experimental result shows relatively high % linear shrinkage of 9.9-21.9 % and high % volumetric shrinkage of 34.5-46.5%. Thermal analysis indicates the formation of the liquid around 632 °C, facilitating liquid phase sintering. The composite microstructures consists of uniformly distributed SiCp throughout the densified aluminium matrix. SiCp addition scales up SiCp clustering, accompanying with gap porosity. The composite reinforced with 10 vol.% SiCp possesses higher sintered density at 2.63 g/cm3, yielding 93.1% theoretical. However the maximum macro Vickers hardness was measured at 164.2 Hv for 20 vol.% SiCp - reinforced aluminium composite in the age-hardened condition. Liquid phase sintering was found effective for the microstructure evolution of the PIMed composite, rendering densification. Hardening is influenced by SiCp addition and the roles of AlN, Al2Cu and Mg2Si precipitates."
"Discovery and Characterization of Cyclotides from Rinorea Species Copyright  2018 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.Cyclotides are macrocyclic cystine-knotted peptides most commonly found in the Violaceae plant family. Although Rinorea is the second-largest genera within the Violaceae family, few studies have examined whether or not they contain cyclotides. To further our understanding of cyclotide diversity and evolution, we examined the cyclotide content of two Rinorea species found in Southeast Asia: R. virgata and R. bengalensis. Seven cyclotides were isolated from R. virgata (named Rivi1-7), and a known cyclotide (cT10) was found in R. bengalensis. Loops 2, 5, and 6 of Rivi1-4 contained sequences not previously seen in corresponding loops of known cyclotides, thereby expanding our understanding of the diversity of cyclotides. In addition, the sequence of loop 2 of Rivi3 and Rivi4 were identical to some related noncyclic ""acyclotides"" from the Poaceae plant family. As only acyclotides, but not cyclotides, have been reported in monocotyledons thus far, our findings support an evolutionary link between monocotyledon-derived ancestral cyclotide precursors and dicotyledon-derived cyclotides. Furthermore, Rivi2 and Rivi3 had comparable cytotoxic activities to the most cytotoxic cyclotide known to date: cycloviolacin O2 from Viola odorata; yet, unlike cycloviolacin O2, they did not show hemolytic activity. Therefore, these cyclotides represent novel scaffolds for use in future anticancer drug design."

"A novel paper-based colorimetry device for the determination of the albumin to creatinine ratio  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A novel paper-based analytical device (PAD) was fabricated and developed for the simple and rapid determination of the albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) in urine samples. The detection was based on a colorimetric reaction using bromocresol green (BG) in a phosphate buffer (PB) at pH 4 for the determination of albumin (AL) and creatinine (CR). BG changes color from greenish-yellow to bluish-green in the presence of AL and/or CR. Picric acid (PA) in 0.25 M NaOH was used to detect CR, and PA changes color from yellow to orange. Under the optimal conditions, the working range was 10 to 350 mg dL-1 with a detection limit of 7.1 and 5.4 mg dL-1 for AL + CR and CR detection, respectively. The repeatability was evaluated, and the %RSD value was less than 8.23 (n = 10). The ACR was obtained by calculating the AL and CR colorimetric results. Finally, the proposed devices were applied to the determination of AL, CR, and ACR in urine samples. The results obtained by the developed PADs were in good agreement with the standard method and demonstrated the method could reliably measure AL, CR, and ACR. The proposed method provides a low-cost, simple, sensitive, and promising tool for diagnostic identification assay for chronic kidney disease (CKD)."
"Deep Learning for Stock Market Prediction Using Event Embedding and Technical Indicators  2018 IEEE.Recently, ability to handle tremendous amounts of information using increased computational capabilities has improved prediction of stock market behavior. Complex machine learning algorithms such as deep learning methods can analyze and detect complex data patterns. The recent prediction models use two types of inputs as (i) numerical information such as historical prices and technical indicators, and (ii) textual information including news contents or headlines. However, the use of textual data involves text representation construction. Traditional methods like word embedding may not be suitable for representing the semantics of financial news due to problems of word sparsity in datasets. In this paper, we aim to improve stock market predictions using a deep learning approach with event embedding vectors extracted from news headlines, historical price data, and a set of technical indicators as input. Our prediction model consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architectures. We use accuracy and annualized return based on trading simulation as performance metrics, and then perform experiments on three datasets obtained from different news sources namely Reuters, Reddit, and Intrinio. Results show that enhancing text representation vectors and considering both numerical and textual information as input to a deep neural network can improve prediction performance."
"Concurrent Starbursts in Molecular Gas Disks within a Pair of Colliding Galaxies at z = 1.52  2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We report on the discovery of a merger-driven starburst at z = 1.52, PACS-787, based on high signal-to-noise ALMA observations. CO(5-4) and continuum emission (850 μm) at a spatial resolution of 0.″3 reveal two compact (r 1/2 ∼ 1 kpc) and interacting molecular gas disks at a separation of 8.6 kpc, indicative of an early stage in a merger. With an SFR of 991 M o yr-1, this starburst event should occur closer to final coalescence, as is usually seen in hydrodynamical simulations. From the CO size, inclination, and velocity profile for both disks, the dynamical mass is calculated through a novel method that incorporates a calibration using simulations of galaxy mergers. Based on the dynamical mass, we measure (1) the molecular gas mass, independent from the CO luminosity, (2) the ratio of the total gas mass and the CO(1-0) luminosity (), and (3) the gas-to-dust ratio, with the latter two being lower than typically assumed. We find that the high star formation triggered in both galaxies is caused by a set of optimal conditions: a high gas mass/fraction, a short depletion time (τ depl = 85 and 67 Myr) to convert gas into stars, and the interaction of likely counter-rotating molecular disks that may accelerate the loss of angular momentum. The state of interaction is further established by the detection of diffuse CO and continuum emission, tidal debris that bridges the two nuclei and is associated with stellar emission seen by HST/WFC3. This observation demonstrates the power of ALMA to study the dynamics of galaxy mergers at high redshift."
"Microbial and small eukaryotes associated with reefs in the upper Gulf of Thailand  2018 Bulan, Wilantho, Tongsima, Viyakarn, Chavanich and Somboonna.Reef sites of Ko Samae San (S), Khao Ma Cho (K) and Ko Tao Mo (T) in the upper Gulf of Thailand have abundant corals and represent a hotspot of marine biodiversity. Coral reefs serve as major networks of food and energy, where bacteria, microbial eukaryotes (fungi) and small eukaryotes play significant roles as primary producers that convert inorganic compounds to organic compounds, degraders of toxic substances, and recyclers. These functions sustain food and energy supplies. Advances in metagenomics and next-generation sequencing can provide knowledge of diversity without limitations imposed by media and other conditions associated with laboratory cultures. Scientists have researched bacterial diversity of coral sites; however, a database for fungi and small eukaryotes from Thailand's sites with abundant corals is lacking. The present study combined fungal ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (F-RISA) and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to unveil the first culture-independent microbial and small eukaryotes from these sites at two times and across four species of coral (Porites lutea, Platygyra sinensis, Acropora humilis, and Acropora millepora), seawater and sediment. Results showed that the small eukaryotic communities on corals were distinct from communities in the surrounding seawater and sediment. The communities were relatively similar at the three sites and during the two periods of time. Pearson's correlations indicated the community diversity were associated with water quality (e.g., dissolved oxygen concentrations and density of water)."
"Computational screening of fatty acid synthase inhibitors against thioesterase domain  2017,  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Thioesterase (TE) domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS) is an attractive therapeutic target for design and development of anticancer drugs. In this present work, we search for the potential FAS inhibitors of TE domain from the ZINC database based on similarity search using three natural compounds as templates, including flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids. Molecular docking was used to predict the interaction energy of each screened ligand compared to the reference compound, which is methyl γ-linolenylfluorophosphonate (MGLFP). Based on this computational technique, rosmarinic acid and its eight analogs were observed as a new series of potential FAS inhibitors, which showed a stronger binding affinity than MGLFP. Afterward, nine docked complexes were studied by molecular dynamics simulations for investigating protein–ligand interactions and binding free energies using MM-PB(GB)SA, MM-3DRISM-KH, and QM/MM-GBSA methods. The binding free energy calculation indicated that the ZINC85948835 (R34) displayed the strongest binding efficiency against the TE domain of FAS. There are eight residues (S2308, I2250, E2251, Y2347, Y2351, F2370, L2427, and E2431) mainly contributed for the R34 binding. Moreover, R34 could directly form hydrogen bonds with S2308, which is one of the catalytic triad of TE domain. Therefore, our finding suggested that R34 could be a potential candidate as a novel FAS-TE inhibitor for further drug design."

The aim of this study was to predict the timing of delivery within seven days in singleton pregnant women with threatened preterm labour and preterm labour by using a three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound measurement of foetal adrenal gland volume enlargement, a foetal zone enlargement and cervicovaginal placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) test. This prospective cohort study included singleton pregnant women at 22–36 +6 weeks of gestation who presented with threatened preterm labour and with preterm labour. Transabdominal 3D ultrasound measurement of the whole foetal adrenal gland and of the foetal adrenal zone were performed. Qualitative cervicovaginal PAMG-1 detection was performed at the same time. One hundred and fifty-four pregnant women were included into the study. Eighty-four pregnant women had threatened preterm labour and seventy pregnant women had preterm labour. Twenty-nine pregnant women (18%) delivered within seven days. Use of foetal adrenal gland volume enlargement, foetal zone enlargement and the PAMG-1 test in combination increased sensitivity; if one parameter was positive, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 82.8%, 27.2%, 20.9% and 87.2%, respectively, in the prediction of the timing of delivery within seven days. The combination of foetal adrenal gland enlargement and PAMG-1 increased sensitivity for the prediction of the timing of delivery within seven days in pregnant women presenting with threatened preterm labour and preterm labour.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? An increased foetal adrenal gland volume is significantly correlated with the risk of preterm birth. What do the results of this study add? The combination of a foetal adrenal gland enlargement and a placental alpha microglobulin-1 increased sensitivity for the prediction of the timing of delivery within seven days in pregnant women presenting with threatened preterm labour and preterm labour. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The combination of a foetal adrenal gland enlargement and placental alpha microglobulin-1 may be used for the prediction of the timing of delivery within seven days in pregnant women presenting with threatened preterm labour and with preterm labour."

"Application of design of experiments for industrial paint production process improvement  2018 Author(s).This research is to find the influential parameters that affect the reduction time of the grinding process in industrial paint production process by finding the optimum conditions which comprise five parameters, i.e. the volume of binder, the volume of solvent, the time to mix for premix process before into grinding process, the bead size and the volume of bead for grinding process. The experiments require 16 runs instead of the original (full factorial design) 32 runs by using the fractional factorial design (25-1) and runs order was randomized at two levels for the selecting parameters and the screening experiments on a response. The response surface methodology (RSM) with the central composite design (CCD) is analyzed. The results show that the four significant parameters are the volume of binder (22.4%) and the volume of solvent (5% of the premix formula in premix process), the time to mix in homogeneous before into grinding process (60 minutes) and the bead size (3.0?mm). After that the confirmation trials are performed by implementing four parameters in the actual production process. The results showed that the average grinding time is decreased to 6.15 hours from 8.79 hours, or 30.03%; whereas, the process capability (Cpk) is increased from 0.86 to 1.44."

The results showed that the performance of Ni catalyst was improved by the incorporation of TiN. The modified catalysts provided not only high catalytic activity but also enhancement of coke resistance."
"Recent developments in bifunctional air electrodes for unitized regenerative proton exchange membrane fuel cells – A review  2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCUnitized regenerative proton exchange membrane fuel cell (UR-PEMFC) technology has progressed in the recent past and has started appearing towards few applications. However, the UR-PEMFC viability is limited by its lower round-trip efficiency mainly due to several reasons such as sluggish air electrode reactions, lower performance/stability, higher materials cost etc. In this context, many approaches are being implemented for efficiency enhancement including design and development of effective bifunctional air electrodes (oxygen reduction and evolution reactions) materials both for fuel cell and electrolyzer modes as well as for optimization of operating condition for performance stability in real life applications. This review focusses on the recent developments of air electrode active materials design/development for performance improvement in UR-PEMFC. Among all developed electrode materials, the catalysts with Pt- and Ir-based metals still provided the maximum round-trip efficiency of about 50% at 500 mA cm−2 in the unit cell."
"Compatibility of banana starch nanocrystals/poly(butylene succinate) bio-nanocomposite packaging films  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.This work focused on the effects of compatibility techniques [i.e., modification of filler and addition of an l-lysine diisocyanate (LDI) coupling agent] and filler content on the properties of bio-nanocomposite films prepared using poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) as a matrix and starch nanocrystals (SNC) as filler by chill-roll cast film extrusion. The films reinforced with modified SNC had superior tensile and barrier properties than those reinforced with unmodified SNC or an added LDI. Elongation at break of 1%wt modified SNC/PBS film was increased up to 51.1% compared with neat PBS film. Water vapor transmission rate and oxygen transmission rate values of 9%wt modified SNC/PBS film (54.1 g m−2 day and 216.3 cc m−2 day) were lower than those of neat PBS film (114.5 g m−2 day and 560.3 cc m−2 day) due to the higher hydrophobicity and better dispersion of modified SNC in PBS leading to the superior properties of PBS films. The PBS bio-nanocomposite films can be completely degraded within ~3 months under wastewater treatment condition.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2018, 135, 46836."
"One pot preparation of chitosan/hyaluronic acid-based triple network hydrogel via in situ click reaction, metal coordination and polyion complexation in water  2018Development of biopolymer hydrogels with multiple networks is regarded as a way to obtain gel strengths with bio-related properties. The present work, for the first time, demonstrates preparation of one pot triple network hydrogel of chitosan (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (HA-triazole/CS-Cu(II) gel), formed by triazole linkage, metal-coordination, and CS-HA polyion complexation. The salt containing water system favors polyion complex formation of CS and HA without precipitation. HA functionalized with alkyne and azide groups in aqueous EDC/NHS allows crosslinking of HA via triazole linkage using Cu(I) azide-alkyne Click chemistry (CuAAC). The required Cu(I) catalyst is generated from Cu(II) in the CS-Cu complex upon addition of sodium ascorbate. The CS/NHS system leads to the solubilization of CS, thus enabling ionic gelation. The mechanical properties and morphologies can be controlled by simply varying the CS-HA mole ratios. In addition, the CS-HA triple-network (TN) hydrogels show biocompatibility based on studies with chondrocyte cells."

"Comparative effectiveness of anti-viral drugs with dual activity for treating hepatitis B and HIV co-infected patients: A network meta-analysis  2018 The Author(s).Background: There are randomized trials assessing a variety of antiviral drugs for hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the relative effectiveness of these drugs in the treatment of patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains unclear. The objectives of the current study were to estimate and rank the relative effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating HBV and HIV co-infected patients. Methods: Randomized trials, assessing the efficacy of antiviral drugs for HBV and HIV co-infected patients were searched in health-related databases. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Main outcome in this meta-analysis study was the success of treatment by antivirals as determined by virologic response. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis of these trials and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Results: Seven randomized trials (329 participants) were included in this network meta-analysis study. A network geometry was formed with six treatment options including four antiviral drugs, adefovir (ADV), emtricitabine (FTC), lamivudine (LMV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), combination treatment of TDF plus LMV, and placebo. The weighted percentage contributions of each comparison distributed fairly equally in the entire network of evidence. An assumption of consistency required for network meta-analysis was not violated (the global Wald test for inconsistency: Chi2(4) = 3.63, p = 0.46). The results of estimates showed no differences between the treatment regimens in terms of viral response for treating HBV and HIV co-infected patients, which spanned both benefit and harm (e.g. LMV vs TDF plus LMV: OR: 0.37, 95%CI: 0.06-2.41). Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low in all comparisons (e.g. LMV vs TDF plus LMV: 218 fewer per 1000,121 more to 602 fewer, very low certainty). Therefore, we remained uncertain to the true ranking of the antiviral treatments in HBV/ HIV co-infected patients. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the evidence is insufficient to provide guidance to the relative effectiveness of currently available antiviral drugs with dual activity in treating co-infection of HBV/HIV. Well-designed, large clinical trials in this field to address other important outcomes from different epidemiological settings are recommended."
"The Molecular Gas Content and Fuel Efficiency of Starbursts at z ∼ 1.6 with ALMA  2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present an analysis of the molecular gas properties, based on CO (2-1) emission, of 12 starburst galaxies at z ∼ 1.6 selected by having a boost (4×) in their star formation rate (SFR) above the average star-forming galaxy at an equivalent stellar mass. ALMA observations are acquired of six more galaxies than previously reported through our effort. As a result of the larger statistical sample, we significantly detect, for the first time at high z, a systematically lower /L IR ratio in galaxies lying above the star-forming ""main sequence"" (MS). Based on an estimate of CO (i.e., the ratio of molecular gas mass to ), we convert the observational quantities (e.g., /L IR) to physical units (M gas/SFR) that represent the gas depletion time or its inverse, the star formation efficiency. We interpret the results as indicative of the star formation efficiency increasing in a continuous fashion from the MS to the starburst regime, whereas the gas fractions remain comparable to those of MS galaxies. However, the balance between an increase in star formation efficiency and gas fraction depends on the adopted value of CO as discussed."
"Thai defamatory text classification on social media  2018 IEEE.Development of social media has brought a huge change to social communities in several aspects. They offer a place where social media users can post information, express opinions, and share interests. However, some information and opinions may cause a negative impact on the person mentioned in the post and that person can become a target of defamation. In Thailand, although defaming someone on social media is illegal, most social media users are not aware of it. To raise awareness of this issue, this paper proposes the classification of defamatory text in Thai language. Several approaches to text classification are used to analyze textual comments to political news and articles on Facebook, including word n-grams, character ngrams, specific terms, grammatical dependency structure, and sentiment polarity. The experiment is conducted using two machine learning methods with several combination of the approaches. The result shows that SVM performed better than Naïve Bayes, and word n-grams and character n-grams are more efficient than other approaches with F score of 0.64 and accuracy of 0.74. In addition, dependency structure, specific terms, and sentiment polarity perform quite well with precision of 0.65 and accuracy of 0.66, but with lower recall rate of 0.35. We discuss linguistic variations in Thai language which affect the performance of the methods."
"Optical Properties of Individual Aragonite Plates from Nacre  2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe unique structural architecture of nacre from sea shells (e. g., mussel, pearl oyster, and abalone shells) is the basis of this substance's brilliant iridescent coloration. In fact, nacre consists of alternating bilayers of plate-shaped aragonite and an organic binder. In this paper, we first report the optical characteristics of individual aragonite plates derived from nacre. A simple chemical method is employed to disintegrate nacre without structural and polymorphism changes. Implementation of this method enable us to investigate the optical properties of individual aragonite plates. Evidence indicate that most light is transmitted by aragonite plates, a phenomenon that contributes substantially to the fantastic iridescent colors displayed by nacre. Reflected light, on the other hand, displays wavelength selectivity that depends on the thickness of the aragonite plates. As typical material applications, natural aragonite plates are utilized as transparent fillers and as a pigment for surface coating. Aside from their use as optical materials, aragonite plates can also be employed as a solid support for the growth of metal nanoparticles and utilize for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy."
"Factors influencing the quality of life among Indonesian elderly: A nursing home-based cross-sectional survey  2018, Bayu Anggileo Pramesona and Surasak Taneepanichskul.Purpose: In spite of being a significant public health concern, quality of life (QoL) amongst elderly in nursing home (NH) settings is rarely analyzed. The purpose of this paper is to examine the level of QoL and factors influencing QoL amongst elderly NH residents in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted amongst 181 elderly at three NHs in three districts in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Purposive sampling was used for the study site and sample collection. Face-to-face interviews were performed using the WHO Quality of Life BREF Indonesian version questionnaire to assess elderly QoL. Multivariate linear regression was performed to determine the factors influencing the QoL amongst elderly NH residents. Findings: The response rate was 66.3 percent. A total of 64.1 percent of elderly had a fair level of QoL, whereas 16.6 percent still had a poor level of QoL. A total of 86.7 percent of elderly lived in an NH due to compulsion, and more than half (53.6 percent) perceived inadequacy of care. The QoL was significantly low amongst those who live in NHs due to compulsion, no social support resources, not receiving any kind of support, having three chronic diseases and perceived inadequacy of care (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that perceived adequacy of care reasons for living in NH was associated with QoL (p<0.001). Originality/value: Perceived adequacy of care and reason for living in an NH were highlighted as predictors of QoL amongst elderly NH residents. Improving adequate healthcare services and developing treatment strategies to enforce the adaptation process is required in order to maintain the QoL in elderly NH residents."
"Health and disease concepts: an approach to health development  2018, Samlee Plianbangchang.Purpose: Health for all is an ideal goal that all governments aspire to reach. The purpose of this paper is to assess the definitions of the key terms used to better appreciate the role of the WHO member states in their efforts to achieve improved healthcare systems that suit each nation’s particular needs. Design/methodology/approach: Definitions of the terms disease, illness and health are discussed against health concepts as a means of assessing the most effective approach toward achieving an effective universal healthcare system. Findings: Universal health and treatment of sickness and disease have improved globally, but the target of achieving total wellness still remains as a goal for the future and may be impeded by diseases that have not yet evolved. The implementation of a universal health coverage system is a positive step toward achieving the goals of health and wellness for the present times. Originality/value: This is a commentary piece."
"Developement of Composite Armors Using Natural Rubber Reinforced with Steel Wire Mesh for Ballistic Resistance  2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.A protective ballistic armor used for military buildings, that will meet the anti-terrorism and force protection demands, are increasingly needed, particularly in Thailand's southernmost provinces. A new type of ballistic armor system has been developed, composing of composite layers, using natural rubber reinforced with steel wire mesh, and Al plate. The composite layers were used as front material while the Al plate was used as backing plate. The armors were tested against NIJ-Type III threats using NIJ 0108.01 ballistic test standard. The armor, with 12 mm Al backing plate, can successfully resist the NIJ-Type III treat with only combination of two composite layers. Different than hard and brittle plate, such as ceramic, the use of composite layer at the front did not blunt and erode the projectile, due to its ductile property. However, the composite layer effectively reduces the velocity of projectile, due to high fracture toughness, as a result of reinforcing steel wire mesh layers in the composites. The projectile was finally stopped by the Al backing plate."
"Examining the relationships between HR practices, organizational job embeddedness, job satisfaction, and quit intention: Evidence from Thai accountants  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend job embeddedness research by investigating employees’ perception of human resource (HR) practices as the predictors of organizational job embeddedness, and its mediating role between HR practices and quit intention. It also assesses the moderating effect of job satisfaction on the job embeddedness-turnover relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a questionnaire survey from 1,028 accountants in various disciplines from one of the largest corporations in Thailand, including its numerous subsidiaries and joint ventures. Hypotheses were tested and analyzed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis, multiple regressions, and a bootstrapping procedure. Findings: The results reveal that all HR practices except training are positively related to organizational job embeddedness. Analysis also provides support for the mediating effects on quit intention of two HR practices, namely rewards and career development, through organizational job embeddedness. In addition, the interaction effect shows that the negative relationship between organizational job embeddedness and quit intention reduces when job satisfaction is high. Research limitations/implications: The current research took place among accountants. Replicating the study in a variety of business sectors, professions, or cultures would be useful for the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Several HR strategies and tactics can help improve employee loyalty. Particularly effective are attractive rewards that reflect work values, and a promising career roadmap. Organizations might need to consider work conditions that sustain job satisfaction for turnover prevention in the short-term, and continuously manage long-term retention through embeddedness. Originality/value: This study extends current research by investigating the relationships of so far untested theorized antecedents that clarify how employees become embedded in the workplace in order to keep them from quitting."
"Investigation of instructional design on reading comprehension affect the demand for mobile application for students with learning disabilities  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.This research aims to investigate the current teaching methods for reading comprehension that affect the demand for mobile application for students with learning disabilities (LDs). This research examines the factors that significantly impact on the application of visual language - mind maps with stories and Thai traditional folk tales for teaching reading comprehension via mobile application. The instruments used in the study are questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The collected samples consist of 423 students with LDs at elementary level (grades 4-6), and 36 teachers in teaching Thai, from 17 schools located in Bangkok, Thailand. All of them are respondents to the questionnaires and 17 teachers were invited to attend semi-structured interviews. The findings show that students have the greatest need for learn with stories and Thai traditional folk tales, with an average of 4.55. Secondly, students are motivated using rewarding technique with the mean of 4.17, followed by using mind maps to summarize stories with the mean of 4.05. These values are consistent with the teacher's point of view. Additionally, the results from semi-structured interviews suggest that the new instructional design should integrate mind maps into multimedia folk tales application. Consequently, the findings emphasize the need for mobile applications in order to improve reading comprehension skill for students with LDs in learning Thai language."

The findings of this study may serve as a useful input to web developers and symbol designers for creating shortly perceived loading symbols."
"Detecting points of interest in a city from taxi GPS with adaptive DBSCAN  2018 IEEE.Points of Interest (POIs) are popular places that create activities and transportation demands in a city. As cities constantly evolve, keeping an up-To-date map of POIs is difficult. However, by observing digital footprints of people, including taxi pick-up and drop-off locations, we can detect hotspots of activities that indicate POI locations by using techniques such as point clustering. DBSCAN is a popular density-based clustering algorithm for geographic data points. However, the effectiveness of the algorithm relies on determining appropriate parameters that match the distribution pattern of data points. That is hard because pick-up and drop-off locations are distributed differently in different areas. This paper proposes a method to automatically determine the parameters of DBSCAN according to point distribution in each dataset. The algorithm has been applied to pick-up and drop-off locations of taxis in Bangkok. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively discovered POIs in areas with different distribution patterns."
"Results of a real-world study on vortioxetine in patients with major depressive disorder in South East Asia (REVIDA)  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Objective: The REVIDA study aimed to assess the evolution of major depression symptoms in South East Asian (SEA) patients treated with vortioxetine for major depression in real-world clinical practice. Methods: This non-interventional study was conducted from August 2016 to April 2017. A total of 138 patients (aged 18–65 years) with an active episode of major depression were recruited from Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Vortioxetine was initiated on the first visit and patients were followed for 3 months. Depression severity was assessed using the PHQ-9 questionnaire (patient assessed) and CGI-S scale (physician assessed); cognitive function was assessed with the PDQ-D questionnaire; work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) was assessed with the WPAI questionnaire. Results: At baseline, 89.9% of patients were moderately to severely depressed (PHQ-9 score ≥10). During the 3 month treatment period, mean ± SD PHQ-9 score decreased from 18.7 ± 5.7 to 5.0 ± 5.3, mean ± SD CGI-S score decreased from 4.4 ± 0.7 to 2.2 ± 1.1 and mean ± SD PDQ-D score decreased from 42.1 ± 18.8 to 13.4 ± 13.0. By Month 3, response and remission rates reached 80.8% and 59.0%, respectively. Work productivity loss decreased from 73.6% to 30.5%, while activity impairment decreased from 71.5% to 24.6%. Positive correlations were observed between PHQ-9, PDQ-D, and WPAI work productivity loss and activity impairment. By Month 3, 82.0% of patients were either not depressed or only mildly depressed (PHQ-9 score ≤9). Conclusion: In real-world clinical settings, vortioxetine was effective in reducing depression severity and improving cognitive function and work productivity in SEA patients with major depression."
"1H NMR Metabolomics Identifies Underlying Inflammatory Pathology in Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Joints  2018 American Chemical Society.Despite osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) being typically age-related, their underlying etiologies are markedly different. We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify differences in metabolite profiles in low volumes of OA and RA synovial fluid (SF). SF was aspirated from knee joints of 10 OA and 14 RA patients. 100 μL SF was analyzed using a 700 MHz Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer with a TCI cryoprobe. Spectra were analyzed by Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Metaboanalyst. 50 metabolites were annotated, including amino acids, saccharides, nucleotides and soluble lipids. Discriminant analysis identified group separation between OA and RA cohorts, with 32 metabolites significantly different between OA and RA SF (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Metabolites of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were lower in RA compared to OA; these results concur with higher levels of inflammation, synovial proliferation and hypoxia found in RA compared to OA. Elevated taurine in OA may indicate increased subchondral bone sclerosis. We demonstrate that quantifiable differences in metabolite abundance can be measured in low volumes of SF by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which may be clinically useful to aid diagnosis and improve understanding of disease pathogenesis."
"Correlation of plasma microRNA-21 expression and bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women  2018,  2018 International Menopause Society.Objectives: This study assessed the correlation of plasma microRNA-21 expression and bone turnover markers (BTMs: CTx, P1NP) in healthy Thai postmenopausal women. We secondarily compared microRNA-21 expression between participants with normal and low bone mineral density (BMD: osteopenia and osteoporosis). Methods: Postmenopausal women who had never been diagnosed with fracture or never used anti-osteoporosis drugs were included in this study. Baseline characteristics were collected from all 195 participants. BTMs and plasma miR-21-5p were analyzed from blood collection at 8:00 and 9:00 am after overnight fasting for at least 8 h. Results: There was no significant correlation between miR-21-5p and any of the BTMs (CTx, r = 0.094, p = 0.19; P1NP, r = 0.05, p = 0.485). Significant correlation between miR-21-5p and P1NP was found when participants were further categorized into those aged ≥70 years (r = 0.46, p = 0.05) and those having osteoporosis (r = 0.51, p = 0.06). Slight negative correlations were found between miR-21-5p and BMD. There was statistically significant higher expression of miR-21-5p in those with low BMD when compared to the normal BMD group (p < 0.01). Conclusion: In this study, we did not find significant correlation between plasma microRNA-21-5p expression and the BTMs. Nevertheless, there seemed to be higher expression of miR-21-5p in the low BMD participants."

Methods: This study employed three waves (2010–2014) of the China Family Panel Studies. The data set included 10,330 adults in each wave. Fixed effect and random effect logistic models and multinomial logistic model were used for data analysis. Results: First, according to the fixed effect logistic model, the results showed that current and former smokers are positively (ORs > 1) and significantly associated with outpatient care. Moreover, former smokers are positively (ORs > 1) and significantly associated with inpatient utilization. Second, based on the random effect logistic model, the results illustrated that heavy smokers and long-term quitters are positively (ORs > 1) and significantly related to outpatient care, and former smokers are positively (ORs > 1) and significantly associated with inpatient utilization. Conclusions: Firstly, the present study found that current and former smokers use more outpatient care than non-smokers. Moreover, former smokers use more inpatient care than non-smokers. Secondly, former smokers use more inpatient care than non-smokers, long-term quitters decrease the probability of using inpatient care compared with recent and moderate-term quitters."
"Study of nonionic surfactants on HVOCs removal from coacervate solutions using cocurrent vacuum stripping in a packed column  2018,  2018 Prince of Songkla University.Cloud point extraction has been shown to be an effective technique to remove hydrophobic volatile organic compounds (HVOCs) from aqueous solution using nonionic surfactant. A cocurrent vacuum stripper is used to recover the surfactant in coacervate phase from extraction for economic viability. The solutions containing two series of aromatic and chlorinated HVOCs. Surfactants studied were alkyl phenol ethoxylates, secondary alcohol ethoxylates (AEs), and branched secondary AEs. From equilibrium measurements, the apparent Henry’s law constant (volatility) of the HVOCs in surfactant solution decreased with increasing HVOCs hydrophobicity due to solubilization of the HVOCs in micelles. The results showed that the mass transfer of HVOC decreases due to the solubilization enhancement of the HVOCs."
"Caloinophyllin A, a new chromanone derivative from Calophyllum inophyllum roots  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.A new chromanone derivative, namely caloinophyllin A (1), along with eight known compounds (2–9), nobiletin (2), pentamethylquercetin (3), 3,5,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone (4), 5,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (5), 1,5-dihydroxyxanthone (6), 1,8-dimethoxy-2-hydroxyxanthone (7), 1,6-dihydroxy-7-methoxyxanthone (8) and 4-methoxycaffeic acid (9) were isolated from the roots of Calophyllum inophyllum. The structures of all the isolated compounds (1–9) were fully characterised using spectroscopic data, as well as comparison with the previous literature data. In addition, the quantum chemical calculation has been used to confirm the conformation of 1. Moreover, all isolated compounds were assessed for their in vitro cytotoxicity against five human cancer cell lines."
"Teacher development in rural China: how ineffective school leadership fails to make a difference  2017,  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This study examined if and how the learning-centred leadership of rural school principals in China impacted teachers’ trust and agency, as well as their engagement in professional learning. In contrast to prior research, however, this mixed methods study sought to illuminate the impact of ineffective leadership on teachers and school improvement. Quantitative data analysis affirmed that learning-centred leadership was associated with more active teacher engagement in professional learning, and that these effects were partially mediated by teacher trust and agency. However, additional quantitative analyses revealed that rural principals in our sample exercised significantly weaker learning-centred leadership than their urban counterparts, and that this was associated with lower levels of teacher trust, agency and professional learning. This quantitative analysis set the stage for a case study of one rural school principal whose school was unsuccessful in implementing a reform aimed at building teacher capacity. The qualitative data illuminate how sociocultural norms shaped interactions not only between the principal and his teachers (e.g. hierarchy), but among the teachers themselves (e.g. hierarchy and collectivism). Finally, the case study illustrates how ineffective leadership engenders mistrust and resistance among teachers, making them wary of assuming ownership of change."
"Comparison of Anterior Segment Parameters among Koreans, Chinese, and White Persons  2018 American Academy of OphthalmologyPurpose: To evaluate anterior segment (AS) parameters obtained by AS OCT within an urban Korean population and to compare them with measurements seen in Chinese and white participants. Design: Prospective, cross-sectional, clinic-based study. Participants: Three gender- and age-matched cohorts of Korean, Chinese, and white participants recruited from general ophthalmology clinics in urban academic hospital settings. Methods: Anterior segment OCT (Visante OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) was used to image the AS of all participants. Customized software was used to calculate AS parameters. Main Outcome Measures: Five angle parameters (AOD500, AOD750, TISA500, TISA750, ARA), 5 iris parameters (IT750, IT2000, ITCM, Iarea, Icurv), and 5 anterior chamber parameters (ACD, ACW, ACA, ACV, LV) were compared. Anterior vault (AV), relative AV, and relative LV were also calculated. These parameters were compared across all cohorts using a Kruskal-Wallis test. General linear models were built to assess pairwise comparison between Korean and Chinese and between Korean and white cohorts. Two-sided P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We also considered Bonferroni correction to control family-wise type 1 error (ɑFW = 0.05 / 18 = 0.003). Results: The study included 132, 124, and 112 participants in the Korean, Chinese, and white cohorts, respectively. Korean participants showed AS parameters similar to those of Chinese participants, with the exception of having a smaller average ACW and a larger average IT2000. Compared with white persons, Koreans showed smaller angle parameters (trabecular–iris space area measured at 500 μm and 750 μm from the SS and angle recess area), anterior chamber parameters (ACD, ACW, ACA, ACV), and thicker irises (iris thickness measured at 750 μm and 2000 μm from the SS, maximum IT at the middle one third of the iris). The Korean cohort also was noted to show a smaller average LV compared with both Chinese and white cohorts. Conclusions: The Korean cohort demonstrated smaller average LV and relative LV."
"Metal Artifact Reduction by Mapping MR into CT Information  2018 IEEE.One of the fundamental noise in Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is metal artifact. The artifact leads to the information loss. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is not affected by this artifact. In this paper, we propose using the information from MR images to reproduces the information lost due to dental filling in CT images. First, we register the CT and MR images of the same patient. Then, we classify the skull into 3 regions: teeth, tissue near the teeth and others. For teeth and tissue near the teeth, we develop the mapping function between the intensity in the MR image to the mean intensity in the CT image. The pixels corrupted by the metal artifact are detected and their intensity are changed according to the mapping function with its MR intensity as the input. The proposed method significantly removed metal artifacts and could be used to improve the diagnosis and planning accuracy."
"Spatial and seasonal variability of reef bacterial communities in the Upper Gulf of Thailand  2018 Bulan, Wilantho, Krainara, Viyakarn, Chavanich and Somboonna.Reefs at Ko Samae San (S), Khao Ma Cho (K), and Ko Tao Mo (T), in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT) represent a biodiversity hotspot, and bacteria play significant roles in maintaining the health of these coral reefs and their biogeochemical cycles. Therefore, this study analyzed bacterial communities (microbiota) from healthy corals and nearby seawater and sediment, using B-RISA and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Sampling was done in one dry and one wet season to provide an initial assessment of variation with environmental conditions. The most prevalent coral species were Porites lutea, Platygyra sinensis, Acropora humilis, and Acropora millepora. The B-RISA and the sequencing results were correlated, which increased confidence the results. The microbiota varied among corals, seawater, and sediment and between the wet and dry seasons. Percentages of bacteria with known functions varied among sample types and seasons, and their relative abundances supported previously reported essential functions, such as prevention of disease (e.g., Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter, and Cobetia were more abundant on corals in the dry season). Pearson's correlations and multiple factor regressions identified dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, salinity, and density as significant influences on the microbiota. The equations estimated the relative abundance of a community comprising 147 bacterial genera, as well as the relative abundance of Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Verrucomicrobium, and Epulopiscium (R2 ≥ 0.721). These results represent the first descriptions of microbiota from corals, and surrounding seawater and sediments in the upper GoT."
"Development of polymorphic microsatellites in white scar oyster crassostrea belcheri  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.The white scar oyster Crassostrea belcheri is one of economically important species in Thailand. To improve the management efficiency of C. belcheri, appropriate molecular markers are needed to be developed. In this study, microsatellites in C. belcheri were cross-amplified using type I microsatellites designed from express sequence tag (EST) of Crassostrea gigas. In total, 60 EST-derived microsatellites of C. gigas were tested and 41 loci (68.33%) generated the amplification product against genomic DNA of C. belcheri. Of these, 18 loci (43.90%) were polymorphic and were preliminary screened for estimation of a polymorphic level against C. belcheri originating from Surat Thani (N = 50). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 15 with an average number of 8.83 alleles per locus. The observed heterozygosity varied from 0.0000 to 0.8571 with an average of 0.3982 whereas the expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.4149 to 0.8930 with an average of 0.7487. These polymorphic microsatellites were further tested against bulked genomic DNA (5 bulks with 10 individuals for each bulk) from 5 different geographic locations. Thirteen pairs of primers generated the positive amplification products across all examined geographic samples while two pairs of primers yielded the amplification products only in the Surat Thani sample and they were regarded as candidate population-specific markers. Microsatellites in the present study provide a valuable fundamental resource to facilitate further research on population genetics and stock management of C. belcheri in Thailand."
"Ecteinascidin 770, A tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid, targeting the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved. FtsZ, a crucial protein in bacterial cell division has recently become of interest as target for the discovery of new antibacterial treatments. Owing to its conservation in prokaryote and the finding that is an inhibitor of FtsZ, it is expected to be developed as a new antibacterial drug with high specificity and rare occurrence of bacterial resistance. In this study, the antibacterial activities of Ecteinascidin 770 (ET770) and its effects on bacterial FtsZ were determined using in vitro and in silico methods. ET770 is a semi-synthesized product from marine tunicate classified as tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid. ET770 was proven as potential antibacterial agent against S. aureus, B. subtilis, MRSA and E. coli with an MIC of 2.02, 1.01, 2.02, and 32.43 µM, respectively. The effects of ET770 on bacterial cell division was investigated using E. coli str. K-12 substr. JW0093. Treating E. coli JW0093 with 0.1 mM of ET770 mostly induced filamentous forming and elongation of cell morphology. Whereas untreated E. coli JW0093 had a typical short rod and was a single-celled bacteria. Moreover, ET770 showed remarkable inhibition of GTPase-like activity of FtsZ with an IC 50 of 0.96 nM. The decrease of FtsZ polymerization ratio was observed using a dynamic light scattering technique when 10, 50 and 100 µM of ET770 were added to purified FtsZ. The binding of ET770 in the nucleotide binding pocket of the homology model of E. coli-FtsZ was predicted using flexible docking and its binding mode was analyzed. The overall results concluded that ET770 might be developed into a novel antibacterial drug through the inhibition of bacterial FtsZ."
"Application of surfactant aqueous-based solution for oil and phorbol esters extraction from jatropha curcas L. seed-kernel in one step  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved. Jatropha curcas L. oil (JO) derived from both hexane extraction and mechanical screwpressing contains phorbol esters (PEs), which is a suspected carcinogen. This study proposed a JO extraction using mixed surfactant aqueous-based solutions under the appropriate proportion and physical conditions to obtain the highest free oil yield to reduce the PE partition in the oil. The results show that the anionic surfactant enhanced the free oil separation efficiency twofold compared with nonionic surfactant alone. The optimal condition is 1 min of contact time with 13.61 rad s -1 of orbital shaking and 1 g of the kernel per 10 mL of surfactants solution (30 g-Dehydol LS2, 0.2 g-Alfoterra 145-4PO and 6 g-NaCl in 1 L) which could yield 73% by mass fraction of oil for single extraction. The extracted PEs under that condition is higher in surfactant-rich phase and lower in free oil phase. The mass fraction of extracted PE distributed 53%, 29%, 17% and 1% in surfactant-rich phase, free oil, meal and aqueous phase, respectively. Mixed surfactants solution has ability to extract the oil and PEs in the one-step oil extraction. A half of PEs in the kernel was separated within the surfactant phase. This method is considered a clean technology concept that may be useful for further development and application in the future."
"Deep multispectral painting reproduction via multi-layer, custom-ink printing  2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).We propose a workflow for spectral reproduction of paintings, which captures a painting's spectral color, invariant to illumination, and reproduces it using multi-material 3D printing. We take advantage of the current 3D printers' capabilities of combining highly concentrated inks with a large number of layers, to expand the spectral gamut of a set of inks. We use a data-driven method to both predict the spectrum of a printed ink stack and optimize for the stack layout that best matches a target spectrum. This bidirectional mapping is modeled using a pair of neural networks, which loss function helps find the best possible ink layout resulting in the balance between spectral reproduction and colorimetric accuracy under a multitude of illuminants. In addition, we introduce a novel spectral vector error diffusion algorithm based on combining color contoning and halftoning, which simultaneously solves the layout discretization and color quantization problems, accurately and efficiently. Our workflow outperforms the state-of-the-art models for spectral prediction and layout optimization. We demonstrate reproduction of a number of real paintings and historically important pigments using our prototype implementation that uses 10 custom inks with varying spectra and a resin-based 3D printer."
"Roles of aboveground roots facilitating sedimentation and elevation change in a mangrove forest behind bamboo seawalls  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.We studied sedimentation rates and elevation changes in a naturally rehabilitated-mangrove forest dominated by Avicennia spp. and compared the results to a seedling plantation of Rhizophora mucronata and a bare soil area behind bamboo seawalls in Samutsakorn, Thailand. The average sedimentation rates in the forest plots (0.0196 g cm-2 d-1) were significantly lower than those in the bare-soil plots (0.0269 g cm-2 d-1) which had a greater variation in the sedimentation rates that indicated a less consistent sedimentation rate on the exposed soil surface. Consequently, the annual net elevation changes were positive in the plots with the presence of mangrove roots (ranging from 6.37-10.87 cm) compared to negative changes in the bare-soil plots (ranging from –5.97 to –12.97 cm). The results highlighted the importance of the natural mangrove forest having a higher potential to accumulate sediments and stabilize the coastal area compared to the adjacent bare soils area behind the bamboo seawall."
"Effectiveness of cold therapy in reducing acute pain among persons with cardiac surgery: A randomized control trial  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.The aim of this randomized control trial, repeated-measure design was to investigate the effects of cold therapy in reducing pain after cardiac surgery during the first 72 postoperative hours. Seventy participants were matched and were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=35) or control group (n=35). The experimental group received a sterile cold gel pack to maintain the skin temperature at 10-15 °C for 20 min. The control group received the routine care. Acute pain was measured using a Thai version of the modified Brief Pain Inventory. The data were analyzed with repeated measures MANOVA. The results showed that the experimental group had significantly lower mean pain than the control group (P<0.001). In addition, pain scores in the experimental group were significantly decreased during the first 72 postoperative hours (P<0.001). Thus, the cold therapy was effective in reducing pain after cardiac surgery during the acute phase."
"Optimization of succinic acid production by succinic acid bacteria isolated in Thailand  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.Two hundred succinic acid-producing bacteria were isolated from cattle dung, soil, bovine rumen, and tree bark collected in Thailand. Eighty-four isolates exhibited a clear zone on the screening plate. The production was analyzed qualitatively by the TLC method and quantitatively by the HPLC method. The succinic acid was in the range of 0.003-0.97 g/g glucose. Only 28 isolates were selected based on morphology, cultural and phenotypic characteristics. The isolates were divided into three groups. Twenty-three isolates in Group I were identified as Enterococcus, 2 isolates in Group II were identified as Lactobacillus, and 3 isolates in Group III were identified as Clostridium. Enterococcus durans (isolate NS15-dA1) and Enterococcus hirae (isolate NS15-bA2) were selected for further study for succinic acid production. The optimum conditions were 60 g/L of glucose, 30 g/L of yeast extract (NS15-dA1), and 30 g/L of tryptone (NS15-bA2) at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. The highest amounts of succinic acid were obtained from the isolates NS15-dA1 (51.69±0.17 g/L) and NS15-bA2 (53.05±0.35 g/L)."
"Analyzing problems affecting the performances of public-private partnership transportation projects - Case studies in Vietnam  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.The increasing demand for transportation and the ineffectiveness in financing infrastructure projects contribute to various challenges for Vietnam in the recent decades. Financial investment in infrastructure projects is usually so large that the state budget cannot cover all of it. In order to encounter this challenge, Vietnam has called for the participation of other economic sectors, especially the private sector. Consequently, the government has been cooperating with the private sector in the form of public-private partnership (PPP). The development of PPP projects faces a variety of critical risks; therefore, it is challenging for the government to attract private investors. This paper investigates the problems affecting the performance of PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. We gathered general information and organizational structures of the PPP projects as well as compiled the problems experienced in previous PPP projects through in-depth interviews with PPP experts in Vietnam. Interestingly, there are a large number of critical problems affecting the feasibility stage of PPP projects, including inadequate feasibility studies, changes in the laws and regulations, government intervention, lack of transparency in bidding, unfair process of selection in the private sector, and conflicting or imperfect contracts. In addition, the only one significant success factor in the PPP projects was incentives provided by the government. The results of this study can assist in implementing PPP transportation projects in Vietnam so that the nation can establish public policies that attract both domestic and foreign private investors."
"Single observation adaptive search for continuous simulation optimization  2018 INFORMS.Optimizing the performance of complex systems modeled by stochastic computer simulations is a challenging task, partly because of the lack of structural properties (e.g., convexity). This challenge is magnified by the presence of random error whereby an adaptive algorithm searching for better designs can at times mistakenly accept an inferior design. In contrast to performing multiple simulations at a design point to estimate the performance of the design, we propose a framework for adaptive search algorithms that executes a single simulation for each design point encountered. Here the estimation errors are reduced by averaging the performances from previously evaluated designs drawn from a shrinking ball around the current design point. We show under mild regularity conditions for continuous design spaces that the accumulated errors, although dependent, form a martingale process, and hence, by the strong law of large numbers for martingales, the average errors converge to zero as the algorithm proceeds. This class of algorithms is shown to converge to a global optimum with probability one. By employing a shrinking ball approach with single observations, an adaptive search algorithm can simultaneously improve the estimates of performance while exploring new and potentially better design points. Numerical experiments offer empirical support for this paradigm of single observation simulation optimization."
"Acute toxicity and teratogenicity of α-mangostin in zebrafish embryos  2019 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. α-Mangostin is the most active compound derived from the pericarps of mangosteen. A number of studies have reported its anticancer activity. However, only a few studies have investigated the toxicity of this compound; moreover, the teratogenicity of α-mangostin has not been reported. In this study, we evaluated the effects of α-mangostin on the development of zebrafish embryos. The exposure of zebrafish embryos to α-mangostin for 72 h dose-dependently induced mortality and abnormal development. The derived LC 50 value of α-mangostin to zebrafish embryos at 72 h was 5.75 ± 0.26 μmol/L. We observed teratogenic effects in α-mangostin-treated embryos, characterized by axis malformation, bent tail, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, sluggish circulation, and heart malformation. The percentages of the malformed embryos were 78.79% and 100% at 4.5 and 6 μM, respectively. α-Mangostin exposure also caused hemostasis in the ducts of Cuvier and a decreased heart rate in zebrafish embryos at 48 and 72 h post-fertilization. These results indicated that α-mangostin induced cardiac dysfunction in zebrafish embryos. In addition, a sub-lethal concentration and a lethal concentration (3 and 6 μM, respectively) were used to assess the compound effects on oxidative stress and embryonic erythropoiesis. α-Mangostin was found to decrease the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, hemoglobin staining revealed a decrease in hemoglobin, which suggested that α-mangostin disrupted embryonic erythropoiesis in zebrafish. To our knowledge, the results of this study, for the first time, demonstrated that α-mangostin was potentially teratogenic and could disrupt embryonic ROS balance and erythropoiesis. Impact statement: α-Mangostin has been reported to have anticancer properties both in vitro and in vivo models. Although there are several studies that evaluated the toxicity of the compound in rodent models, we are the first to evaluate the teratogenicity of α-mangostin. In the present work, we found that α-mangostin induced mortality and malformations in zebrafish embryos. In addition, we exhibited that the compound also disrupted the reactive oxygen species and hemoglobin levels. These findings suggest that α-mangostin may possibly cause the same adverse effects on human health. The mechanisms of these toxicological effects of the compound will be further elucidated and the effects found in zebrafish embryos need to be verified in other animal models."
"Clif-sofa and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin score for the diagnosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure and as a prognostic tool for mortality prediction  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To validate the chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment [CLIF-SOFA] tool for the diagnosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure [ACLF] in hospitalized Thai patients with cirrhosis and to evaluate the clinical significance of urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [uNGAL] in combination with the CLIF-SOFA score to predict ACLF mortality. Materials and Methods: Seventy-seven patients were enrolled. The authors generated new ACLF diagnostic criteria by combining the uNGAL level with the original renal failure criteria from the CLIF-SOFA score [CLIF/NGAL score]. The primary endpoint was the 30-day mortality rate [MR]. Results: ACLF patients, according to the original CLIF-SOFA score, had a 43.7% MR in comparison to the non-ACLF patients, who had a 13.3% MR. The calculated odds ratio [OR] was 3.28, with an area under the ROC [AUROC] of 0.750 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.88, p = 0.001). The CLIF/NGAL score demonstrated better prognostic prediction ability. The MR was 38.6%, with an OR of 4.03 (95% CI 1.29 to 12.61) and an AUROC of 0.772 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.90, p<0.001). Conclusion: The CLIF-SOFA score is valid for ACLF diagnosis among Thai patients. Moreover, the authors new proposed criteria, the CLIF/NGAL score, demonstrated better potential than the original criteria for ACLF mortality prediction."
"The relationship between household particulate matter and an increase of carotid intima-media thickness [cimt]: A one-year follow-up study  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved. Background: Outdoor particulate matter [PM] has been associated with cardiovascular [CVD] morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological and experimental studies confirmed an association between outdoor PM and carotid artery intima-media thickness [CIMT], which can potentially lead to progression of CVD. However, evidence on the effects of indoor PM on the CVD system is still limited. Objective: To examine the association of long-term exposure to household indoor PM of less than 10 micrometer [PM 10 ] and increased carotid intima-media thickness [CIMT] of the common carotid artery [CCA]. Materials and Methods: A one-year follow-up study was conducted in 104 households located in the central city of Sakon Nakhon province, Thailand. Clinical testing and a carotid artery ultrasound of participants were undertaken between September 2016 and September 2017. Household PM 10 concentrations, temperature, and relative humidity [RH] were measured inside the participants’ home during the wet and dry seasons. Results: The average of PM 10 concentrations was 24.2±11.2 μg/m 3 . Mean and maximum CIMT at CCA was different between baseline and follow-up (p-value <0.001). Logistics regression models showed that an increase of 1 μg/m 3 average household PM 10 concentrations were associated with 6% increased risk of increased maximum CIMT of CCA (AOR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11). Conclusion: Household PM 10 concentration is associated with increased CIMT of CCA. This finding suggests that household PM 10 may be a risk factor for CVD morbidity and mortality."
"An analysis of perioperative anesthetic adverse events in thailand [paad thai]: Allergic reaction/anaphylactoid/ anaphylaxis  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Perioperative anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction is an uncommon event and difficult to diagnose. Clinical symptoms range from mild with skin lesion to serious life-threatening conditions. Objective: To describe characteristics of patients who developed anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction during anesthesia including signs, symptoms, treatment, outcome, and suggestive strategies for perioperative anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction in Thailand. Materials and Methods: A prospective descriptive study was conducted by using data from first 2,000 incident reports of the Perioperative and Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand [PAAd Thai] study. Patient characteristic and detail of anaphylaxis including signs, symptoms, probable causes, treatment, and immediate outcome were recorded. All data were reviewed by three experienced anesthesiologists. Descriptive statistics was used. Results: After reviewed, 70 incidents were identified as perioperative anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction. Anaphylaxis occurred more commonly in female. Most (98.5%) were ASA I-III with mean age 42.6±2.5 years. Seventy-two-point-nine percent of events occurred during general anesthesia. By using clinical severity, patients were classified as grade I, II, III, in 38, 4, and 28 patients, respectively. Suspected causes were identified in 41 cases. The most common causes were antibiotic, blood component, and colloid, in 13, 9, and 6 cases, respectively. Clinical manifestations of grade III were hypotension, rash or urticarial, bronchospasm, tachycardia, and angioedema, in 21, 18, 15, 11, and 5 patients, respectively. Only 19 from 28 patients in grade III received adrenaline treatment. All patients in grade I and II recovered completely. In grade III, surgery was postponed in five cases and two cases were admitted to ICU. Only one patient received serologic test and skin test. Conclusion: To improve outcome, guidelines for perioperative anaphylaxis management should be followed. After anaphylaxis event, proper investigation to identify definite cause should be done at proper time."
"The result of conservative management for postoperative seroma following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair [lvhr]  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved. Background: Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair [LVHR] with mesh showed lower recurrent rate than suture repair, especially in defect size larger than 2 cm. Postoperative seroma formation was variable. Materials and Methods: A retrospective descriptive review of 110 patients that received LVHR with mesh in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 2007 and December 2013 from collected database and medical records was done. Results: The mean size of ventral hernia defect was 55 cm 2 (range 4 to 300 cm 2 ). Seven to fourteen days after LVHR, the seroma had been detected by clinical diagnosis in 19 patients (17.2%). Conservative management was success in 16 patients (84.2%). The mean size of seroma was 4.5 cm in diameter (range 2 to 10 cm), and the mean conservative time was two months. However, the conservative management failed in three patients (15.8%). Two patients (10.5%) received aspirated seroma at two and six months after conservative. Only one patient (5.3%) had infected seroma, managed by surgical drainage and mesh removal. Conclusion: Almost all patients with postoperative seroma following LVRH were asymptomatic, could be observed safely, and succeeded conservative treatment within two months after operation. However, it might be necessary to perform interventional or surgical treatment if seroma was symptomatic, persisted more than two months, or became infected."
"Potential of periostin as a urinary biomarker correlated with renal function in lupus nephritis and iga nephropathy patients  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy are the most common causes of secondary and primary of glomerulonephritis. Periostin is a novel biomarker related to kidney disease progression. Previous studies demonstrated the expression of periostin in both animal and human with different types of kidney disease. Objective: The present cohort study was to examine the level of urine periostin in patients with lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy and to identify the correlation between urine periostin level and other variables. The urine periostin measurement and response to therapy after six months of treatment was also evaluated. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy were included in the present study. Urine sample were collected at the biopsy date. Urine periostin measurement were performed. After six months of treatment, response to therapy was assessed and urine samples were collected. Results: Urine periostin was detected in 23 patients and 11 healthy controls with significant higher level in patients than in controls (33.27 ng/mg versus 2.38 ng/mg, p<0.001). Serum creatinine was significant higher in patients with urine periostin detection (0.9 mg/dl versus 0.7 mg/dl, p<0.05). There was also a correlation between urine periostin level and renal function. In addition, urine periostin level was significant lower after six months of treatment in patients with response to therapy (35.70 ng/mg versus 4.35 ng/mg, p<0.05). Conclusion: The present study’s results supported the potential of periostin as a urinary biomarker of kidney disease progression in patients with lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy."
"Can shear wave elastography increase specificity in diagnosis of benign and malignant breast masses?  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To determine whether shear wave elastography [SWE] can increase specificity in diagnosis of benign and malignant breast masses in BI-RADS category 3 and 4. Materials and Methods: Data were collected retrospectively between January 2013 and December 2015 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Breast sonography with supplementary SWE of BI-RADS category 3 and 4, according to the ACR BI-RADS 2013, which had histopathology-proved diagnosis or at least two years of stability, were randomly reviewed by the researchers. Elasticity values were all generated by Supersonic Imagine ultrasound system. Minimal elasticity [Emin], mean elasticity [Emean], and maximal elasticity [Emax] values were separately evaluated among benign and malignant groups. Results: One hundred sixteen lesions in 107 female patients were eligible for the present study. Eighty lesions (68.9%) were benign and 36 lesions (31.0%) were malignant. All Emin, Emean, and Emax showed statistically significant difference between benign and malignant lesions (p-value 0.022, 0.001, and <0.001, respectively). The area under the receiver operating curve [AUC] for elasticity value was slightly higher for maximum (0.733) than mean (0.710) values. The cut-off value of Emax was 110 kPa, showing sensitivity 63.9%, specificity 78.8%, PPV 57.5%, NPV 82.9%, and accuracy 74.1%. All BI-RADS category 3 lesions were benign, as well as all BI-RADS category 4c lesions, were malignant. The cut-off value of Emax below 48 kPa in BI-RADS category 4a lesions proved to be all benign except medullary carcinoma. Maximal Emax value was 300 kPa, which was proven to be diabetes mellitus mastopathy and some malignant lesions. Conclusion: Emin, Emean, and Emax values were significantly different between benign and malignant masses and the specificity was increased as compared with conventional ultrasound alone, especially in BI-RADS category 4a. The present study showed Emax value at 110 kPa had good specificity and high NPV. Elasticity values primarily reflect the degree of fibrosis of breast lesions, which help the diagnosis."
"Safety and efficacy of the thai red cross society albumin replacement for therapeutic plasma exchange  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Albumin replacement has been widely used in various conditions. However, there had been problems of rising cost and supply shortage of imported albumin in Thailand. To solve the problem, the National Blood Centre had established a plasma fractionation plant to manufacture plasma products including albumin. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Thai Red Cross Society [TRCS] albumin. Materials and Methods: To minimize confounder effects of underlying conditions, only patients that underwent therapeutic plasma exchange [TPE] using the TRCS albumin replacement from two hospitals were included. Serum albumin levels were measured before and after TPE. The adverse effects were recorded. Results: One hundred fifty-six TPEs in 35 patients were included. The median total plasma volume was 3,000 (range 1,750 to 4,200) mL. Although the corrected calcium level was low (<8 mg/dL) in 3.2% (5/156) before the procedure, no clinical manifestation of hypocalcemia was detected. Adverse effects were observed during the TPE in two patients. The first patient had two events of hypotension. He previously took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The second patient complained of nausea after finishing TPE. The incidence of adverse effects was 1.9% (3/156). As a historical control, the incidence of TPE adverse effects was 1.6% (2/125) when commercial albumin was used in 2014. The difference was not statistically different (p = 1.000). Median serum albumin levels pre-TPE and post-TPE were 3.6 (1.9 to 4.4) and 3.9 (2.4 to 5.0) g/dL, respectively. The increase in serum albumin after TPE was statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusion: The authors demonstrated that the TRCS albumin was safe and effective in maintaining albumin levels in patients undergoing TPEs."
"Experience of functional mri protocol in king chulalongkorn memorial hospital [kcmh] for thai language lateralization  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To investigate the effects of statistical thresholding and to determine an optimal functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] statistical threshold for Thai language lateralization. Materials and Methods: The present study was prospective descriptive study of twenty Thai native speaker right-handed healthy volunteers performed Thai verb and word generation paradigms during 3T fMRI. Bihemispheric activation difference of language region of interests was calculated for laterality index [LI] through ranks of statistical threshold, from the threshold that generated an empty map to the minimal threshold with p-value less than 0.05. Results: LI of both verb generation and word generation paradigms tended to rise in higher statistical thresholds. In two subjects, shifted of LI from co-dominant to left dominant were found as an effect of statistical thresholding on both paradigms. A threshold (t-value) of 7 in verb generation paradigm and a threshold (t-value) of 6 in word generation paradigm significantly increased mean LI (with p-value 0.004 and 0.003, respectively) and categorized 95% of the subjects as left hemispheric dominance. Conclusion: LI varies across different statistical thresholds. Optimal thresholds (t-value) for language lateralization are 7 in Thai verb generation and 6 in Thai word generation paradigms."
"Search for heavy resonances decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson in final states with charged leptons, neutrinos and b quarks at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for heavy resonances, decaying into the standard model vector bosons and the standard model Higgs boson, is presented. The final states considered contain a b quark-antiquark pair from the decay of the Higgs boson, along with electrons and muons and missing transverse momentum, due to undetected neutrinos, from the decay of the vector bosons. The mass spectra are used to search for a localized excess consistent with a resonant particle. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with background expectations. Exclusion limits are set in the context of spin-0 two Higgs doublet models, some of which include the presence of dark matter. In the spin-1 heavy vector triplet framework, mass-degenerate W′ and Z′ resonances with dominant couplings to the standard model gauge bosons are excluded below a mass of 2.9 TeV at 95% confidence level.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Arthroscopic Synthetic Augmentation in Acute Partial Injury of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament  2018 Arthroscopy Association of North AmericaAcute partial injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a challenging condition without a standard treatment. Although ACL reconstruction provided a better outcome previously, recent studies have shown that preserving the ACL stump yields promising results in terms of better vascularization, proprioception, and ligamentization. ACL augmentation is becoming more popular. Therefore, we propose a technique to augment an acute partial ACL injury with synthetic suture material to stabilize the unstable cruciate ligament. The suture material acts as a structural tie for ACL healing without any need for external immobilization. This technique is beneficial in preserving the natural ACL stump and autograft, creating a narrow bone tunnel, and providing a good cosmetic outcome."
"Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the diphoton decay channel in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the H → γγ decay channel are reported. The analysis is based on data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV during the 2016 LHC running period, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Allowing the Higgs mass to float, the measurement yields a signal strength relative to the standard model prediction of 1.18− 0.14 + 0.17 = 1.18− 0.11 + 0.12(stat)− 0.07 + 0.09(syst)− 0.06 + 0.07(theo), which is largely insensitive to the exact Higgs mass around 125 GeV. Signal strengths associated with the different Higgs boson production mechanisms, couplings to bosons and fermions, and effective couplings to photons and gluons are also measured.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Forecast of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Energy Consumption in Industry Sectors in Thailand  2018 Pruethsan Sutthichaimethee, Danupon Ariyasajjakorn.The aim of this research is to forecast CO2emissions from consumption of energy in Industry sectors in Thailand. To study, input-output tables based on Thailand for the years 2000 to 2015 are deployed to estimate CO2emissions, population growth and GDP growth. Moreover, those are also used to anticipate the energy consumption for fifteen years and thirty years ahead. The ARIMAX Model is applied to two sub-models, and the result indicates that Thailand will have 14.3541 % on average higher in CO2emissions in a fifteen-year period (2016-2030), and 31.1536 % in a thirty-year period (2016-2045). This study hopes to be useful in shaping future national policies and more effective planning. The researcher uses a statistical model called the ARIMAX Model, which is a stationary data model, and is a model that eliminates the problems of autocorrelations, heteroskedasticity, and multicollinearity. Thus, the forecasts will be made with minor error."
"Search for resonances in the mass spectrum of muon pairs produced in association with b quark jets in proton-proton collisions at √s=8 and 13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for resonances in the mass range 12–70 GeV produced in association with a b quark jet and a second jet, and decaying to a muon pair, is reported. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and 35.9 fb−1, respectively. The search is carried out in two mutually exclusive event categories. Events in the first category are required to have a b quark jet in the central region (|η| ≤ 2.4) and at least one jet in the forward region (|η| > 2.4). Events in the second category are required to have two jets in the central region, at least one of which is identified as a b quark jet, no jets in the forward region, and low missing transverse momentum. An excess of events above the background near a dimuon mass of 28 GeV is observed in the 8 TeV data, corresponding to local significances of 4.2 and 2.9 standard deviations for the first and second event categories, respectively. A similar analysis conducted with the 13 TeV data results in a mild excess over the background in the first event category corresponding to a local significance of 2.0 standard deviations, while the second category results in a 1.4 standard deviation deficit. The fiducial cross section measurements and 95% confidence level upper limits on those for a resonance consistent with the 8 TeV excess are provided at both collision energies.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Protein kinase a and high-osmolarity glycerol response pathways cooperatively control cell wall carbohydrate mobilization in aspergillus fumigatus  2018 de Assis et al.Aspergillus fumigatus mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in maintaining the normal morphology of the cell wall and providing resistance against cell wall-damaging agents. Upon cell wall stress, cell wall-related sugars need to be synthesized from carbohydrate storage compounds. Here we show that this process is dependent on cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity and regulated by the high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) MAPKs SakA and MpkC. These protein kinases are necessary for normal accumulation/degradation of trehalose and glycogen, and the lack of these genes reduces glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Alterations in glycogen synthesis were observed for the sakA and mpkC deletion mutants, which also displayed alterations in carbohydrate exposure on the cell wall. Carbohydrate mobilization is controlled by SakA interaction with PkaC1 and PkaR, suggesting a putative mechanism where the PkaR regulatory subunit leaves the complex and releases the SakA-PkaC1 complex for activation of enzymes involved in carbohydrate mobilization. This work reveals the communication between the HOG and PKA pathways for carbohydrate mobilization for cell wall construction. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic human pathogen causing allergic reactions or systemic infections such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, especially in immunocompromised patients. The fungal cell wall is the main component responsible for recognition by the immune system, due to the specific composition of polysaccharide carbohydrates exposed on the surface of the fungal cell wall called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Key enzymes in the fungal cell wall biosynthesis are a good target for fungal drug development. This report elucidates the cooperation between the HOG and PKA pathways in the mobilization of carbohydrates for fungal cell wall biosynthesis. We suggest that the reduced mobilization of simple sugars causes defects in the structure of the fungal cell wall. In summary, we propose that SakA is important for PKA activity, therefore regulating the availability and mobilization of monosaccharides for fungal cell wall biosynthesis during cell wall damage and the osmotic stress response."
"α-Mangostin and apigenin induced the necrotic death of BT474 breast cancer cells with autophagy and inflammation  2018 by the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine. Objective: To find new compounds in order to overcome the mainstay of metastatic breast cancer due to the adverse side effects from, and increasing resistance to, current chemotherapeutic agents. Methods: α-Mangostin and apigenin were reported in comparison to doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug. Ductal carcinoma (BT474) cell line and non-tumorigenic epithelial tissue from mammary gland (MCF-10A) were used. Cell viability assessment was calculated by the standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. Cell morphology was investigated by light microscopy. By flow cytometry analysis, programmed cell death was observed using annexin V and propidium iodide staining while cell-cycle arrest was observed using propidium iodide staining. Change in transcriptional expression was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results: In 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the result revealed α-mangostin and apigenin were more cytotoxic to BT474 cells. Longer exposure times to α-mangostin and apigenin caused more floating cells and a lower density of adhered cells with more vacuoles present in the colonies in BT474 only. α-Mangostin and apigenin caused necrosis in BT474 cells in a 24 h exposure, but a small amount of early apoptotic cells could also be detected at 24, 48 and 72 h exposure, whereas doxorubicin caused early apoptosis to BT474 cells at 24 h. Transcript expression and activity analysis supported caspase-3 was involved in the death of BT474 cells treated by all compounds. Moreover, α-mangostin and apigenin arrested the cell-cycle at the G 1 -phase, but at the G 2 /M-phase by doxorubicin. All three compounds induced a change in transcript expression levels of inflammation-associated, proto-oncogene, autophagy-associated and apoptosis-associated genes. Conclusions: α-Mangostin and apigenin are worth investigating as potential new sources of chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment."
"Measurement of jet substructure observables in t t events from proton-proton collisions at s =13 TeV MEASUREMENT of JET SUBSTRUCTURE OBSERVABLES ... A. M. SIRUNYAN et al.  2018 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration. Published by the American Physical Society.A measurement of jet substructure observables is presented using tt events in the lepton+jets channel from proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. Multiple jet substructure observables are measured for jets identified as bottom, light-quark, and gluon jets, as well as for inclusive jets (no flavor information). The results are unfolded to the particle level and compared to next-to-leading-order predictions from powheg interfaced with the parton shower generators pythia 8 and herwig 7, as well as from sherpa 2 and Dire 2. A value of the strong coupling at the Z boson mass, αS(mZ)=0.115-0.013+0.015, is extracted from the substructure data at leading-order plus leading-log accuracy."
"Search for long-lived particles with displaced vertices in multijet events in proton-proton collisions at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration. Published by the American Physical Society.Results are reported from a search for long-lived particles in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV delivered by the CERN LHC and collected by the CMS experiment. The data sample, which was recorded during 2015 and 2016, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 38.5 fb-1. This search uses benchmark signal models in which long-lived particles are pair-produced and each decays into two or more quarks, leading to a signal with multiple jets and two displaced vertices composed of many tracks. No events with two well-separated high-track-multiplicity vertices are observed. Upper limits are placed on models of R-parity violating supersymmetry in which the long-lived particles are neutralinos or gluinos decaying solely into multijet final states or top squarks decaying solely into dijet final states. For neutralino, gluino, or top squark masses between 800 and 2600 GeV and mean proper decay lengths between 1 and 40 mm, the analysis excludes cross sections above 0.3 fb at 95% confidence level. Gluino and top squark masses are excluded below 2200 and 1400 GeV, respectively, for mean proper decay lengths between 0.6 and 80 mm. A method is provided for extending the results to other models with pair-produced long-lived particles."
"Search for physics beyond the standard model in high-mass diphoton events from proton-proton collisions at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN. Published by the American Physical Society.A search for physics beyond the standard model is performed using a sample of high-mass diphoton events produced in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV. The data sample was collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The search is performed for both resonant and nonresonant new physics signatures. At 95% confidence level, lower limits on the mass of the first Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton in the Randall-Sundrum warped extra-dimensional model are determined to be in the range of 2.3 to 4.6 TeV, for values of the associated coupling parameter between 0.01 and 0.2. Lower limits on the production of scalar resonances and model-independent cross section upper limits are also provided. For the large extra-dimensional model of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali, lower limits are set on the string mass scale MS ranging from 5.6 to 9.7 TeV, depending on the model parameters. The first exclusion limits are set in the two-dimensional parameter space of a continuum clockwork model."
"Mutations in Kinesin family member 6 reveal specific role in ependymal cell ciliogenesis and human neurological development  2018 Konjikusic et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.Cerebrospinal fluid flow is crucial for neurodevelopment and homeostasis of the ventricular system of the brain, with localized flow being established by the polarized beating of the ependymal cell (EC) cilia. Here, we report a homozygous one base-pair deletion, c.1193delT (p.Leu398Glnfs*2), in the Kinesin Family Member 6 (KIF6) gene in a child displaying neurodevelopmental defects and intellectual disability. To test the pathogenicity of this novel human KIF6 mutation we engineered an analogous C-terminal truncating mutation in mouse. These mutant mice display severe, postnatal-onset hydrocephalus. We generated a Kif6-LacZ transgenic mouse strain and report expression specifically and uniquely within the ependymal cells (ECs) of the brain, without labeling other multiciliated mouse tissues. Analysis of Kif6 mutant mice with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunofluorescence (IF) revealed specific defects in the formation of EC cilia, without obvious effect of cilia of other multiciliated tissues. Dilation of the ventricular system and defects in the formation of EC cilia were also observed in adult kif6 mutant zebrafish. Finally, we report Kif6-GFP localization at the axoneme and basal bodies of multi-ciliated cells (MCCs) of the mucociliary Xenopus epidermis. Overall, this work describes the first clinically-defined KIF6 homozygous null mutation in human and defines KIF6 as a conserved mediator of neurological development with a specific role for EC ciliogenesis in vertebrates."
"Prevalence of islet autoantibodies in Thai juvenile-onset type 1 diabetes  2018 Japan Pediatric SocietyBackground: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is caused by autoimmune destruction of islet β-cells of the pancreas. There are overlapping phenotypes in a significant proportion of youth with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Thus, positive pancreatic autoantibodies are helpful to diagnose T1DM. Zinc transporter 8 antibody (ZnT8A) is a recently identified autoantibody in T1DM and no data on ZnT8A in the Thai population have been reported. The aim of this study was therefore to estimate the prevalence of ZnT8A in Thai juvenile-onset T1DM and to evaluate its diagnostic value relative to glutamic acid decarboxylase and insulinoma-2 antigen antibodies (GADA and IA2A). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, patients with T1DM diagnosed before age 15 years, and disease duration <10 years were enrolled. Serum ZnT8A, GADA, and IA2A were measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results: The subjects consisted of 81 youths (30 boys, 51 girls) aged 12.3 ± 4.5 years with T1DM. The median diabetes duration was 3 years (range, 0–10 years). The prevalence of ZnT8A, GADA, and IA2A was 54.3%, 75.3%, and 45.7%, respectively. ZnT8A were detected in 16% of T1DM patients negative for both GADA and IA2A. A combination of ZnT8A, GADA and IA2A could detect 80.2% of patients with T1DM. Combined use of ZnT8A and GADA identified 100% of antibody-positive patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of ZnT8A in Thai juvenile-onset T1DM appears to be higher than in previous studies from Asia. ZnT8A could replace IA2A as an autoimmunity marker in Thai pediatric T1DM patients, with better diagnostic performance."
"A new species of Dischidia (Apocynaceae: Asclepiadoideae) from the limestone hills of southern Thailand  2018 The AuthorsA new lithophyte growing on karst in southern Thailand, D. thaithongiae Kidyoo is here described and illustrated. Its vegetative and reproductive morphological characters are compared with those of the similar D. kerrii. Both species have slender stems and branches with oblong-elliptic to oblong-lanceolate leaves, a ring of long white hairs in the throat of the corolla tube and vestigial staminal corona lobes that are not anchor-shaped. However, the new species is clearly distinguished by the presence of a corolline corona and the shape of the staminal corona lobes."
"Scaling Network Traffic Logger with Microservice Architecture  2018 IEEE.Over the past few years, many large organizations evolve their technology stack to Microservices, also known as the microservice architecture. Although the traditional monolithic architecture is still a good choice for many applications, it does have limitations in scalability. A change made to a small part of the application also requires the entire monolith to be rebuilt and deployed. This makes it harder to maintain a good modular structure over time. This paper thus presents a design of network traffic logger using the microservice architecture. Based on the scaling model, scale cube, each service can be individually scaled, with the result being that the application is scaled more efficiently. The preliminary study was carried out for performance evaluation. The results show that the microservice-based logger yields less query times on Radius log retrieval, compared to the monolithic."
"Search for supersymmetry in events with a τ lepton pair and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented in final states with a τ lepton pair. Both hadronic and leptonic decay modes are considered for the τ leptons. Scenarios involving the direct pair production of τ sleptons, or their indirect production via the decays of charginos and neutralinos, are investigated. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 collected with the CMS detector in 2016. The observed number of events is consistent with the standard model background expectation. The results are interpreted as upper limits on the cross section for τ slepton pair production in different scenarios. The strongest limits are observed in the scenario of a purely left-handed low mass τ slepton decaying to a nearly massless neutralino. Exclusion limits are also set in the context of simplified models of chargino-neutralino and chargino pair production with decays to τ leptons, and range up to 710 and 630 GeV, respectively.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Search for the decay of a Higgs boson in the ℓℓγ channel in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of electrons or muons and a photon is described. Higgs boson decays to a Z boson and a photon (H → Zγ → ℓℓγ, ℓ = e or μ), or to two photons, one of which has an internal conversion into a muon pair (H → γ*γ → μμγ) were considered. The analysis is performed using a data set recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. No significant excess above the background prediction has been found. Limits are set on the cross section for a standard model Higgs boson decaying to opposite-sign electron or muon pairs and a photon. The observed limits on cross section times the corresponding branching fractions vary between 1.4 and 4.0 (6.1 and 11.4) times the standard model cross section for H → γ*γ → μμγ (H → Zγ → ℓℓγ) in the 120–130 GeV mass range of the ℓℓγ system. The H → γ*γ → μμγ and H → Zγ →ℓℓγ analyses are combined for mH =125GeV, obtaining an observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit of 3.9 (2.0) times the standard model cross section.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Search for a charged Higgs boson decaying to charm and bottom quarks in proton-proton collisions at √s=8 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for charged Higgs boson decaying to a charm and a bottom quark (H +→ c b ¯) is performed using 19.7 fb−1 of pp collision data at s=8 TeV. The production mechanism investigated in this search is t t ¯ pair production in which one top quark decays to a charged Higgs boson and a bottom quark and the other decays to a charged lepton, a neutrino, and a bottom quark. Charged Higgs boson decays to c b ¯ are searched for, resulting in a final state containing at least four jets, a charged lepton (muon or electron), and missing transverse momentum. A kinematic fit is performed to identify the pair of jets least likely to be the bottom quarks originating from direct top quark decays and the invariant mass of this pair is used as the final observable in the search. No evidence for the presence of a charged Higgs boson is observed and upper limits at 95% confidence level of 0.8–0.5% are set on the branching fraction ℬ(t → H+b), assuming ℬ(H+ → c b ¯) = 1.0 and ℬ(t → H+b) + ℬ(t → Wb) = 1.0, for the charged Higgs boson mass range 90–150 GeV.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Age-related changes in interstitial fibrosis and germ cell degeneration of the canine testis  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbHFifty-five healthy medium-sized dogs were divided into four groups; young (1–3 years old, n = 14), adult (>3 to 6 years old, n = 12), old (>6 to 9 years old, n = 14) and senile (>9 years old, n = 15). After routine orchiectomy, testes were collected, and the degree of white streak areas on cut surfaces was subjectively assessed. Later, testicular tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome for evaluation of germ cell degeneration and the proportion of interstitial connective tissue, respectively. Semiquantitative severity scoring of germ cell degeneration and quantitative analysis of spermatogenic cells for spermatic index (SI) and Sertoli cell index (SEI) was performed. The score of white streak on cut surface area of the testes increased with age, being higher (p < 0.05) in senile dogs than other age groups; no difference was found between adult and old dogs. The proportion of testicular interstitial fibrosis was highest (p < 0.05) in senile dogs. Positive correlations between age and white streak area (rho = 0.77, p < 0.01) as well as age and interstitial fibrosis (rho = 0.63, p < 0.01) were observed. The severity of germ cell degeneration gradually increased with age and differed among age groups (p < 0.05). Age positively correlated with atrophy of seminiferous tubules (rho = 0.93, p < 0.01). The SI was lower (p < 0.05) in senile dogs compared to other age groups, and SI was not different among young, adult and old dogs. Conversely, SEI was significantly higher in senile dogs compared to young, adult and old dogs. A negative correlation between age and SI (rho = −0.69) and a positive correlation between age and SEI (rho = 0.68) were significant (p < 0.01). In conclusion, influence of age on testicular interstitial fibrosis and germ cell degeneration/depletion were pronounced in dogs over 9 years old."
"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-modified chitosan as a safe and efficient gene delivery vector for spermatogonia cells  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbHThe use of male gonadal tissue as a site for the local delivery of DNA is an interesting concept. Previously, we reported synthesis, physiochemical and biological properties of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-conjugated chitosan as a carrier for DNA delivery to GnRH receptor-overexpressing cells. In this study, the application of modified chitosan as a potential vector for gene delivery to testicular cells was carried out. Transfection efficiency was investigated in mouse-derived spermatogonia cells (GC-1 cells) using green fluorescent protein as a reporter gene. GnRH-conjugated chitosan exhibited higher transfection activity and specificity compared to the unmodified chitosan. Furthermore, the GnRH-modified chitosan showed less cytotoxicity. In conclusion, we have developed and successfully tested the GnRH-modified chitosan for delivery of a transgene of interest to spermatogonia cells in vitro. Such vector could be useful in particular for testis-mediated gene transfer."
"Measurements of the differential jet cross section as a function of the jet mass in dijet events from proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Measurements of the differential jet cross section are presented as a function of the jet mass in dijet events, in bins of jet transverse momentum, with and without a jet grooming algorithm. The data have been recorded by the CMS Collaboration in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb−1. The absolute cross sections show slightly different jet transverse momentum spectra in data and Monte Carlo event generators for the settings used. Removing this transverse momentum dependence, the normalized cross section for ungroomed jets is consistent with the prediction from Monte Carlo event generators for masses below 30% of the transverse momentum. The normalized cross section for groomed jets is measured with higher precision than the ungroomed cross section. Semi-analytical calculations of the jet mass beyond leading logarithmic accuracy are compared to data, as well as predictions at leading order and next-to-leading order, which include parton showering and hadronization. Overall, in the normalized cross section, the theoretical predictions agree with the measured cross sections within the uncertainties for masses from 10 to 30% of the jet transverse momentum.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"New 3d N = 2 dualities from quadratic monopoles  2018, The Author(s).Aspects of three dimensional N = 2 gauge theories with monopole super-potentials and their dualities are investigated. The moduli spaces of a number of such theories are studied using Hilbert series. Moreover, we propose new dualities involving quadratic powers for the monopole superpotentials, for unitary, symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups. These dualities are then tested using the three sphere partition function and matching of the Hilbert series. We also provide an argument for the obstruction to the duality for theories with quartic monopole superpotentials."
"Structure and mechanical properties of ADC 12 Al foam-polymer interpenetrating phase composites with epoxy resin or silicone  Carl Hanser Verlag, MünchenMetal foam is a high-porosity engineering material which has many outstanding properties such as light weight, high specific strength and stiffness, large energy absorption during impact and good thermal transportation. The impregnation of metal foams with polymers produces a new types of composites such as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) or co-continuous composites due to the interconnection on a macroscopic level of individual phases as a co-continuous 3-D network. The coexistence of the metal and polymer phases allows each to contribute its prominent properties to the composite. This innovative composite material is a potential candidate for applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The present study aims to develop two IPCs from open-cell Al foams of 20 ppi impregnated with silicone or epoxy resin. The compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristics of IPCs are also examined and compared. The results show that although both IPCs have a similar foam structure with similar density, the disparities in the properties of impregnated polymers lead to distinct mechanical properties. The combination of Al foam and polymers, both silicone and epoxyresin, results in IPCs stiffer than either of the two individual materials bythemselves. Higher stiffness was found in IPCs with epoxy resin, owing to brittle nature of the resin. Energy absorption capacity was also increased when compared with the original Al foam."
"Measurement of differential cross sections for Z boson production in association with jets in proton-proton collisions at √s=13TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.The production of a Z boson, decaying to two charged leptons, in association with jets in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV is measured. Data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC are used that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.19fb-1. The cross section is measured as a function of the jet multiplicity and its dependence on the transverse momentum of the Z boson, the jet kinematic variables (transverse momentum and rapidity), the scalar sum of the jet momenta, which quantifies the hadronic activity, and the balance in transverse momentum between the reconstructed jet recoil and the Z boson. The measurements are compared with predictions from four different calculations. The first two merge matrix elements with different parton multiplicities in the final state and parton showering, one of which includes one-loop corrections. The third is a fixed-order calculation with next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy for the process with a Z boson and one parton in the final state. The fourth combines the fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order calculation of the process with no parton in the final state with next-to-next-to-leading logarithm resummation and parton showering."
"Effectiveness of self-empowerment-affirmation-relaxation(Self-EAR) program for postpartum blues mothers: A randomize controlled trial  2018, Professional Medical Publications. All rights reserved.Background and Objecvites: Approximately 55-85% of women worldwide have experienced postpartum blues (PPB) during 6-9 weeks after delivery without receiving the counseling program; more than 20% of them have developed into postpartum depression. Study objectives were to evaluate the effect of the SelfEAR program to improve the postpartum blues scores and serum allopregnanolone level among newly blues mothers. Methods: During June 2015 to May 2016, the randomized controlled trial was conducted among 76 Nulliparous blues mothers who were screened with Stein’s postpartum blues scores ≥ 3. All participants were randomly assigned either to the intervention group (Self-EAR program) and the control group (standard postpartum care program). The Self-EAR program was transformed into audio files which were installed in an MP3 digital device before providing it to the intervention group in order to be implemented at home three times per day for four weeks. Participants were assessed at baseline, 1-month, 2-month and 3-month follow-up for serum allopregnanolone level. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistic, chi-square test, t-test, and repeated measure analysis of variance. Result: After the 3-month follow-up, the results revealed positive effects of the Self-EAR program on postpartum blues scores (p-value=0.002) and serum allopregnanolone concertation (pvalue=0.001). The participants in the intervention group had experienced significantly lower postpartum blues scores; on the other hand, they had significantly higher serum allopregnanolone level when compared with the control group. Conclusions: The findings suggested that the Self-EAR program was effective to improve postpartum blues scores and allopregnanolone level among newly postpartum blues mothers."
"Searches for pair production of charginos and top squarks in final states with two oppositely charged leptons in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for pair production of supersymmetric particles in events with two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons) and missing transverse momentum is reported. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV collected with the CMS detector during the 2016 data taking period at the LHC. No significant deviation is observed from the predicted standard model background. The results are interpreted in terms of several simplified models for chargino and top squark pair production, assuming R-parity conservation and with the neutralino as the lightest supersymmetric particle. When the chargino is assumed to undergo a cascade decay through sleptons, with a slepton mass equal to the average of the chargino and neutralino masses, exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are set on the masses of the chargino and neutralino up to 800 and 320 GeV, respectively. For top squark pair production, the search focuses on models with a small mass difference between the top squark and the lightest neutralino. When the top squark decays into an off-shell top quark and a neutralino, the limits extend up to 420 and 360 GeV for the top squark and neutralino masses, respectively.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Management of an outbreak of brucellosis in a multiple species ruminant farm in Malaysia  Universiti Putra Malaysia PressThis case report describes the management of an outbreak of brucellosis in a mixed ruminant farm in Selangor, central region of Peninsular Malaysia. Two cows with a history of abortion and endometritis were presented to the University Veterinary Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia. Based on the history, physical examination and results of Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT), brucellosis was highly suspected. This led to the screening of all the animals (n = 384) in the affected farm. The Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) revealed that 23 cattle were positive, while no agglutination was observed in goats and deer. A confirmatory test was performed on all the (n = 384) animals using the complement fixation test (CFT) and the results showed that two (2) cows and five (5) deer tested positive. The CFT positive animals were culled. Preventive steps were then taken where the remaining cattle in the herd were vaccinated once using the RB51 vaccine, while the deer and goats were not vaccinated. All animals in the herd were also recommended to be subjected for blood sampling every 4 months and the serum samples to be tested using competitive ELISA to distinguish between serological responses due to vaccination from infection. To overcome outbreak scenario of brucellosis in a farm, a prompt action and a concerted team work among relevant stakeholders are crucial to curb the situation."
"Mass-radius ratio bounds for compact objects in Lorentz-violating dRGT massive gravity theory  2018, The Author(s).We consider the mass-radius bounds for spherically symmetric static compact objects in the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theories, free of ghosts. In this type of gravitational theories the graviton, the quantum of gravity, may have a small, but non-vanishing mass. We derive the hydrostatic equilibrium and mass continuity equations in the Lorentz-violating massive gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant and for a non-zero graviton mass. The case of the constant density stars is also investigated by numerically solving the equilibrium equations. The influence of the graviton mass on the global parameters (mass and radius) of these stellar configurations is also considered. The generalized Buchdahl relations, giving the upper and lower bounds of the mass-radius ratio are obtained, and discussed in detail. As an application of our results we obtain gravitational redshift bounds for compact stellar type objects in the Lorentz-violating dRGT massive gravity, which may (at least in principle) be used for observationally testing this theory in an astrophysical context."
"Atrial fibrillation following heart transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies  2018 Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdObjective: Previous studies have suggested a high incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart transplant recipients. However, incidence trends of AF in heart transplant recipients remain unclear. The study's aims were (1) to investigate the pooled incidence/incidence trends of AF following heart transplantation and (2) to assess the mortality risk of heart transplant recipients with AF. Methods: A literature search for studies that reported the incidence of AF following heart transplantation was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Database from inception through March 2018. Pooled incidence and odds ratios (OR) with 95%CI were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: Eighteen studies (2 cohorts from clinical trials and 16 cohort studies) with 5393 heart transplant recipients were enrolled. The pooled estimated incidence of AF in heart transplant was 10.1% (95%CI: 7.6%-13.2%). Meta-analysis based on the type of anastomotic technique demonstrated a pooled estimated incidence of AF following heart transplantation of 18.7% (95%CI: 10.3%-31.5%) and 11.1% (95%CI: 6.5%-18.4%) by biatrial and bicaval techniques, respectively. There was a significant association between AF following a heart transplant and increased mortality risk with a pooled OR of 2.86 (95%CI: 2.08-3.93). Meta-regression analyses showed no significant correlations between the year of study and incidence of AF (P = 0.47) or mortality risk of AF after heart transplantation (P = 0.99). Conclusions: The overall estimated incidence of AF following heart transplantation is 10.1%. There is a significant association between AF and increased mortality after transplantation. Furthermore, incidence and mortality risk of AF following heart transplant does not seem to decrease over time."
"Search for black holes and sphalerons in high-multiplicity final states in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search in energetic, high-multiplicity final states for evidence of physics beyond the standard model, such as black holes, string balls, and electroweak sphalerons, is presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016. Standard model backgrounds, dominated by multijet production, are determined from control regions in data without any reliance on simulation. No evidence for excesses above the predicted background is observed. Model-independent 95% confidence level upper limits on the cross section of beyond the standard model signals in these final states are set and further interpreted in terms of limits on semiclassical black hole, string ball, and sphaleron production. In the context of models with large extra dimensions, semiclassical black holes with minimum masses as high as 10.1 TeV and string balls with masses as high as 9.5 TeV are excluded by this search. Results of the first dedicated search for electroweak sphalerons are presented. An upper limit of 0.021 is set at 95% confidence level on the fraction of all quark-quark interactions above the nominal threshold energy of 9 TeV resulting in the sphaleron transition.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Effect of ultrasonic bath immersion on physical properties of an mma-based orthodontic base-plate material  2018, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research. All rights reserved.Introduction: Self-cured Methyl Methacrylate (MMA)-based acrylic resin is commonly used for fabricating removable orthodontic appliances. However, residual monomer can leach out and cause mucosal irritation. Furthermore, it can reduce the physical properties of the appliance. Using ultrasonic immersion with ethanol solution is an effective method to reduce the level of residual monomer. However, its effect on the physical properties has not been reported. Aim: To investigate the effect of ultrasonic bath immersion in water or ethanol solutions on the physical properties of an MMA-based orthodontic base-plate material. Materials and Methods: Eighty rectangular and 80 disc-shaped specimens of an MMA-based orthodontic base-plate material (Orthoplast, Vertex-Dental) were prepared in stainless steel moulds as per the manufacturer’s instructions and randomly divided into eight groups: Group I, untreated control; Groups II and III, immersed in 25°C water for 24 and 72 hours respectively; Groups IV-VIII, immersed 10 minutes in an ultrasonic bath at 50°C of water, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% ethanol, respectively. The flexural strength and flexural modulus were measured with a universal testing machine and microhardness was measured with a microhardness indenter. Water sorption and solubility were measured per ISO 20795-2. The data were analysed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s HSD test (p<0.05). Results: The flexural strengths of Groups IV and VIII were significantly higher compared with Group I, while the others were not significantly different from Group I. For flexural modulus, Groups II, IV, VI, VII, VIII were significantly higher than Group I, however, Groups III and V were not significantly different. There were no significant differences in microhardness between the groups. The water sorption of Groups VI, VII, and VIII were significantly lower compared with Group I while that of the others were not significantly different. The water solubility of the experimental Groups were not significantly different compared with that of Group I, except for that of Group IV, which was higher. Conclusion: An ultrasonic bath immersion with either 50°C water or 50°C ethanol (10%, 20%, 30% and 40%) resulted in improved or unaltered physical properties of an MMA-based orthodontic base-plate material."
"Studies of Bs2∗(5840)0 and B s 1(5830) 0 mesons including the observation of the Bs2∗(5840)0→B0KS0 decay in proton-proton collisions at √s=8TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.Measurements of Bs2∗(5840)0 and B s 1(5830) 0 mesons are performed using a data sample of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of [InlineEquation not available: see fulltext.], collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8TeV. The analysis studies P-wave Bs0 meson decays into B (∗) +K - and B(∗)0KS0, where the B + and B 0 mesons are identified using the decays B +→ J / ψK + and B 0→ J / ψK ∗(892) 0. The masses of the P-wave Bs0 meson states are measured and the natural width of the Bs2∗(5840)0 state is determined. The first measurement of the mass difference between the charged and neutral B ∗ mesons is also presented. The Bs2∗(5840)0 decay to B0KS0 is observed, together with a measurement of its branching fraction relative to the Bs2∗(5840)0→B+K- decay."
"Chemical modification of enveloped viruses for biomedical applications  The Royal Society of Chemistry.The unique characteristics of enveloped viruses including nanometer size, consistent morphology, narrow size distribution, versatile functionality and biocompatibility have attracted attention from scientists to develop enveloped viruses for biomedical applications. The biomedical applications of the viral-based nanoparticles include vaccine development, imaging and targeted drug delivery. The modification of the structural elements of enveloped viruses is necessary for the desired functions. Here, we review the chemical approaches that have been utilized to develop bionanomaterials based on enveloped viruses for biomedical applications. We first provide an overview of the structures of enveloped viruses which are composed of nucleic acids, structural and functional proteins, glycan residues and lipid envelope. The methods for modification, including direct conjugation, metabolic incorporation of functional groups and peptide tag insertion, are described based on the biomolecular types of viral components. Layer-by-layer technology is also included in this review to illustrate the non-covalent modification of enveloped viruses. Then, we further elaborate the applications of chemically-modified enveloped viruses, virus-like particles and viral subcomponents in biomedical research."
"Anti-adipogenic effect of flavonoids from Chromolaena odorata leaves in 3T3-L1 adipocytes  2018 Shanghai Changhai HospitalObjective: The leaves of Chromolaena odorata, a highly invasive shrub found growing wild worldwide, are traditionally used for wound healing. Due to its high flavonoid contents, we aimed to find a new application for this plant. Preliminary tests using its ethanolic leaf extract showed that it could suppress the accumulation of lipids in adipocytes. We therefore studied the anti-adipogenic effect of several C. odorata leaf extracts and the relationship between molecular structure and bio-activity of its isolated flavonoid constituents using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes/adipocytes as a model. Methods: Three leaf extracts and thirteen flavonoids isolated from C. odorata were tested for their effect on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using AdipoRed reagent, with quercetin as the positive control. The effects of active flavonoids on the adipocytes were confirmed by oil red O staining and visualized under a light microscope. Results: n-Hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of C. odorata leaves displayed anti-adipogenic activity. The latter extract was the more potent one, especially at 40 µg/mL. Four flavonoids, pectolinarigenin, kaempferide, 4,2′-dihydroxy-4′,5′,6′-trimethoxychalcone and dillenetin, exhibited significant, concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The most potent flavonoid obtained in this study was 4,2′-dihydroxy-4′,5′,6′-trimethoxychalcone, which caused 75% and 90% inhibition of cellular lipid accumulation at 30 and 50 µmol/L, respectively. Both kaempferide and 4,2′-dihydroxy-4′,5′,6′-trimethoxychalcone were major constituents in the ethyl acetate extract of this plant. Conclusion: C. odorata leaves contained several flavonoids with anti-adipogenic effects against lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The plant, normally considered a useless weed, may actually provide an abundant source of biologically active flavonoids."
"Phoyunnanin e induces apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells via p53 activation and down-regulation of survivin  2018 International Institute of Anticancer Research.All right reserved.Background/Aim: Lung cancer is by far the most common cause of cancer mortality, accounting for nearly 20% of all global cancer deaths. Therefore, potent and effective compounds for treatment of this cancer type are essential. Phoyunnanin E, isolated from Dendrobium venustum (Orchidaceae), has promising pharmacological activities; however, it is unknown if phoyunnanin E affects apoptosis of lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: The apoptosis-inducing activity of phoyunnanin E on H460 lung cancer cells was investigated by Hoechst 33342, and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining. The underlying mechanism was determined via monitoring apoptosis-regulatory proteins by western blot analysis. The apoptotic effect of the compound was confirmed in H23 lung cancer cells. Results: Phoyunnanin E significantly induced apoptotic cell death of H460 lung cancer cells, as indicated by condensed and fragmented nuclei with the activation of caspase-3 and -9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Phoyunnanin E mediated apoptosis via a p53- dependent pathway by increasing the accumulation of cellular p53 protein. As a consequence, anti-apoptotic proteins including induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) were found to be significantly depleted, while proapoptotic BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) protein was upregulated. Furthermore, it was found that expression of an inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin, markedly reduced in response to phoyunnanin E treatment. The apoptosis-inducting effect was also found in phoyunnanin E-treated H23 lung cancer cells. Conclusion: These results indicate the promising effect of phoyunnanin E in induction of apoptosis, that may be useful for the development of novel anticancer agents."
"Sun protection behavior and knowledge of patients attending laser clinic to prevent adverse events of laser: A cross-sectional, single-center, tertiary care study  2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Limited data of sun protection knowledge in laser treatment patients exists therefore, preventative information should be provided by dermatologists to minimize harmful effects. Objective: To assess sun protection knowledge-behavior and knowledge to prevent adverse events from laser therapy among patients who visited a laser clinic at a tertiary university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: This is a self-reported questionnaire, cross-sectional survey. All participants from the Laser Clinic in KCMH were recruited into the study. Results: A Total of 385 patients were enrolled into the study; 80.5% female participants. Patients who never received laser treatment significantly lacked proper sun protection knowledge to prevent adverse events of lasers when compared to those who previous received laser treatments regarding the application of sunscreen after laser treatment (56.6% vs 17.4%, P <.001), consistent application of sunscreen 4-6 weeks prior to receiving laser treatment (60.5% vs 18.9%, P <.001), application of topical corticosteroid after laser (67.1% vs 54.1%, P =.048), and sun protection in the post laser area (41.9% vs 20.4%, P <.001). Conclusion: The attitude and knowledge of sun protection to prevent adverse events were significantly different among the group of educational levels and previous history of laser treatment."
"Measurement of the top quark mass with lepton+jets final states using p p collisions at √s=13TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.The mass of the top quark is measured using a sample of t t ¯ events collected by the CMS detector using proton-proton collisions at s=13TeV at the CERN LHC. Events are selected with one isolated muon or electron and at least four jets from data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1. For each event the mass is reconstructed from a kinematic fit of the decay products to a t t ¯ hypothesis. Using the ideogram method, the top quark mass is determined simultaneously with an overall jet energy scale factor (JSF), constrained by the mass of the W boson in q q ¯ ′ decays. The measurement is calibrated on samples simulated at next-to-leading order matched to a leading-order parton shower. The top quark mass is found to be 172.25±0.08(stat+JSF)±0.62(syst)GeV. The dependence of this result on the kinematic properties of the event is studied and compared to predictions of different models of t t ¯ production, and no indications of a bias in the measurements are observed."
"Which body position is the best for chest wall motion in healthy adults? A meta-analysis  2018 Daedalus Enterprises.BACKGROUND: Chest wall motion is a vital component of the respiratory system. Body position changes disturb joint orientation around the chest wall and results in performance modifications of respiratory muscles and movement surrounding the rib cage and the abdomen. Body position is a priority treatment for preserving and promoting chest wall motion. The objective of the study was to conduct a meta-analysis to provide insight into which body position most effectively improves chest wall motion. METHODS: Medical literature databases were systemically searched up to January 31, 2018. Methodological quality was evaluated by using a checklist for measuring quality. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of body positions on chest wall motion. The quality of evidence was judged by using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. RESULTS: Six studies (5 high-and 1 low-quality) were identified. Our results showed that the sitting position provided greater improvement in chest-wall diameter changes and volume related to rib-cage function versus other body positions (very low to moderate evidence). The supine position demonstrated greater enhancement of chest-wall–diameter changes and volume in the part of the abdomen than the other body positions with very low to moderate evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review indicated that the sitting position improved the rib-cage compartment of the chest wall, whereas the supine position resulted in the superior enhancement in the part of the abdomen relative to other body positions. These changes in the body position could have some effect on the movements of the rib cage and abdomen and the variations in lung volumes, which need to be interpreted with caution when considering implemen tation in the clinical setting."
"Comprehensive proteomics identification of IFNλ3-regulated antiviral proteins in HBV-transfected cells  2018 Makjaroen et al.Interferon lambda (IFNλ) is a relatively unexplored, yet promising antiviral agent. IFNλ has recently been tested in clinical trials of chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB), with the advantage that side effects may be limited compared with IFNλ, as IFNλ receptors are found only in epithelial cells. To date, IFNλ's downstream signaling pathway remains largely unelucidated, particularly via proteomics methods. Here, we report that IFNλ3 inhibits HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells, reducing levels of both HBV transcripts and intracellular HBV DNA. Quantitative proteomic analysis of HBV-transfected cells was performed following 24-hour IFNλ3 treatment, with parallel IFNλ2a and PBS treatments for comparison using a dimethyl labeling method. The depth of the study allowed us to map the induction of antiviral proteins to multiple points of the viral life cycle, as well as facilitating the identification of antiviral proteins not previously known to be elicited upon HBV infection (e.g. IFITM3, XRN2, and NT5C3A). This study also shows up-regulation of many effectors involved in antigen processing/presentation indicating that this cytokine exerted immunomodulatory effects through several essential molecules for these processes. Interestingly, the 2 subunits of the immunoproteasome cap (PSME1 and PSME2) were up-regulated whereas cap components of the constitutive proteasome were down-regulated upon both IFN treatments, suggesting coordinated modulation toward the antigen processing/presentation mode. Furthermore, in addition to confirming canonical activation of interferonstimulated gene (ISG) transcription through the JAKSTAT pathway, we reveal that IFNλ3 restored levels of RIG-I and RIG-G, proteins known to be suppressed by HBV. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that several biological processes including RNA metabolism, translation, and ER-targeting were differentially regulated upon treatment with IFNλ3 versus IFNλ2a. Our proteomic data suggests that IFNλ3 regulates an array of cellular processes to control HBV replication."
"Reduction in replication-independent endogenous DNA double-strand breaks promotes genomic instability during chronological aging in yeast  2018 FASEB.The mechanism that causes genomic instability in nondividing aging cells is unknown. Our previous study of mutant yeast suggested that 2 types of replication-independent endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (RIND-EDSBs) exist and that they play opposing roles. The first type, known as physiologic RIND-EDSBs, were ubiquitous in the G0 phase of both yeast and human cells in certain genomic locations and may act as epigenetic markers. Low RIND-EDSB levels were found in mutants that lacked chromatin-condensing proteins, such as the high-mobility group box (HMGB) proteins and Sir2. The second type is referred to as pathologic RIND-EDSBs. High pathological RIND-EDSB levels were found in DSB repair mutants. Under normal physiologic conditions, these excess RIND-EDSBs are repaired in much the same way as DNA lesions. Here, chronological aging in yeast reduced physiological RIND-EDSBs and cell viability.A strong correlationwas observed between the reduction in RIND-EDSBs and viability in aging yeast cells (r = 0.94, P < 0.0001).We used galactose-inducible HO endonuclease (HO) and nhp6aΔ, an HMGB protein mutant, to evaluate the consequences of reduced physiological RIND-EDSB levels. The HO-induced cells exhibited a sustained reduction in RIND-EDSBs at various levels for several days. Interestingly, we found that lower physiologic RIND-EDSB levels resulted in decreased cell viability (r = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Treatment with caffeine, a DSB repair inhibitor, increased pathological RIND-EDSBs, which were distinguished fromphysiologic RIND-EDSBs by their lack of sequences prior toDSB in untreated cells [odds ratio (OR) ≤1]. Caffeine treatment in both the HO-induced and nhp6aΔ cells markedly increased OR ≤1 breaks. Therefore, physiological RIND-EDSBs play an epigenetic role in preventing pathological RIND-EDSBs, a type of DNA damage. In summary, the reduction of physiological RIND-EDSB level is a genomic instability mechanism in chronologically aging cells."
"Streptomyces lichenis sp. nov., isolated from lichen  2018 IUMS. A new actinobacterial strain, LCR6-01 T , was isolated from a lichen sample collected from Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. Its taxonomic position was determined using a polyphasic approach. The strain had morphological characteristics and chemotaxonomic properties identical to those of members of the genus Streptomyces. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H 6 ) and MK-9(H 8 ). The major fatty acids were anteiso-C 15: 0 , iso-C 15: 0 , iso-C 16: 0 , iso-C 14: 0 and C 16: 0 . The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified phosphoglycolipid, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified lipid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 74.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that the strain belonged to the genus Streptomyces. The strain showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Streptomyces palmae TBRC 1999 T (98.6 %), Streptomyces misionensis JCM 4497 T (98.6 %), Streptomyces matensis JCM 4268 T (98.5 %), Streptomyces althioticus KCTC 9752T (98.5 %) and Streptomyces wuyuanensis KCTC 29112 T (98.4 %). DNA-DNA relatedness values among the strain and closely related Streptomyces species were below 70 %. On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics and genotypic distinctiveness, strain LCR6-01 T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces lichenis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LCR6-01 T (=KCTC 39908 T =TISTR 2500 T )."
"Skin signs in juvenile- and adult-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: clues to different systemic involvement  The Author(s) 2018.Objective: We aim to explore the differences of skin signs between juvenile- and adult-onset systemic lupus erythematosus and to identify their associations to the development of systemic involvement. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 377 systemic lupus erythematosus patients was performed. Results: In total, 171 patients with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus and 206 with adult systemic lupus erythematosus were studied. All patients were of Southeast Asian descent. The mean duration of follow up was 8.18 ± 6.19 and 9.36 ± 7.68 years for juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus and adult systemic lupus erythematosus, respectively. At diagnosis, most patients presented with acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, whereas chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus was twice as common in adult systemic lupus erythematosus (p < 0.001). The mean Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus was significantly higher than that of adult systemic lupus erythematosus (14.29 ± 7.13 vs 11.27 ± 6.53). Multivariate analysis revealed the following associations in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and non-scarring alopecia with increased risk of arthralgia, mucosal ulcers with leukopenia, cutaneous vasculitis with seizure, and finding of granular casts. On the contrary, the associations for adult systemic lupus erythematosus were oral ulcers with arthralgia and cutaneous vasculitis with myositis. Conclusions: Cutaneous signs in systemic lupus erythematosus may signal prognostic implication. Interestingly, despite similar cutaneous lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus, different ages of onset are associated with different systemic involvement."
"Loss of CAMSAP3 promotes EMT via the modification of microtubule–Akt machinery  2018. Published by The Company of Biologists LtdEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays pivotal roles in a variety of biological processes, including cancer invasion. Although EMT involves alterations of cytoskeletal proteins such as microtubules, the role of microtubules in EMT is not fully understood. Microtubule dynamics are regulated by microtubule-binding proteins, and one such protein is CAMSAP3, which binds the minus-end of microtubules. Here, we show that CAMSAP3 is important to preserve the epithelial phenotypes in lung carcinoma cells. Deletion of CAMSAP3 in human lung carcinoma-derived cell lines showed that CAMSAP3-deficient cells acquired increased mesenchymal features, mostly at the transcriptional level. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying these changes demonstrated that tubulin acetylation was dramatically increased following CAMSAP3 removal, leading to the upregulation of Akt proteins (also known as protein kinase B proteins, hereafter Akt) activity, which is known to promote EMT. These findings suggest that CAMSAP3 functions to protect lung carcinoma cells against EMT by suppressing Akt activity via microtubule regulation and that CAMSAP3 loss promotes EMT in these cells."
"Blocking of type 1 angiotensin II receptor inhibits T-lymphocyte activation and IL-2 production  2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. All rights reserved.Background/Aim: Novel information on the role of endogenous compounds in regulating physiological and pathological process are of interest, as it may lead to the development of better strategies for disease management. The role of angiotensin II and the signaling of type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AGT1R) in T-lymphocyte activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production are largely unknown. Materials and Methods: Jurkat T-cells were treated with AGT1R inhibitor candesartan and stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. T-Cell activation, associated cytokine production and levels of signaling proteins were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Results: Candesartan significantly suppressed PMA and ionomycin-induced CD25 expression and IL-2 production. Regarding the molecular mechanism involved, we showed that such suppressive effects of blocking of AGT1R by candesartan resulted in the significant inhibition of ERK activation in PMA-stimulated Jurkat T-cells. The effect of ERK inhibition on T-cell activation was further confirmed. Treatment with FR180204, a specific ERK inhibitor, reduced T-cell activation and IL-2 secretion. Conclusion: AGT1R signaling is essential for T-cell activation and IL-2 production, and the inhibition of this pathway suppressed T-cell activation via an ERK-dependent mechanism."
"Genetic tools for coronary risk assessment in type 2 diabetes: A cohort study from the ACCORD clinical trial  2018 by the American Diabetes Association.OBJECTIVE We evaluated whether the increasing number of genetic loci for coronary artery disease (CAD) identified in the general population could be used to predict the risk of major CAD events (MCE) among participants with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A weighted genetic risk score (GRS) derived from 204 variants representative of all the 160 CAD loci identified in the general population as of December 2017 was calculated in 5,360 and 1,931 white participants in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) and Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) studies, respectively. The association between GRS and MCE (combining fatal CAD events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina) was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS The GRS was associated with MCE risk in both ACCORD and ORIGIN (hazard ratio [HR] per SD 1.27, 95% CI 1.18–1.37, P = 4 3 10210, and HR per SD 1.35, 95% CI 1.16–1.58, P = 2 3 1024, respectively). This association was independent from interventions tested in the trials and persisted, though attenuated, after adjustment for classic cardiovascular risk predictors. Adding the GRS to clinical predictors improved incident MCE risk classification (relative integrated discrimination improvement +8%, P = 7 3 1024). The performance of this GRS was superior to that of GRS based on the smaller number of CAD loci available in previous years. CONCLUSIONS When combined into a GRS, CAD loci identified in the general population are associated with CAD also in type 2 diabetes. This GRS provides a significant improvement in the ability to correctly predict future MCE, which may increase further with the discovery of new CAD loci."
"Examination of Australian Streptococcus suis isolates from clinically affected pigs in a global context and the genomic characterisation of ST1 as a predictor of virulence  2018 Elsevier B.V.Streptococcus suis is a major zoonotic pathogen that causes severe disease in both humans and pigs. Australia's pig herd has been quarantined for over 30 years, however S. suis remains a significant cause of disease. In this study, we investigated S. suis from 148 cases of clinical disease in pigs from 46 pig herds over a period of seven years, to determine the level of genetic difference from international isolates that may have arisen over the 30 years of separation. Isolates underwent whole genome sequencing, genome analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Data was compared at the core genome level to clinical isolates from overseas. Results demonstrated five predominant multi-locus sequence types and two major cps gene types (cps2 and 3). At the core genome level Australian isolates clustered predominantly within one large clade consisting of isolates from the UK, Canada and North America. A small proportion of Australian swine isolates (5%) were phylogenetically associated with south-east Asian and UK isolates, many of which were classified as causing systemic disease, and derived from cases of human and swine disease. Based on this dataset we provide a comprehensive outline of the current S. suis clones associated with disease in Australian pigs and their global context, with the main finding being that, despite three decades of separation, Australian S. suis are genomically similar to overseas strains. In addition, we show that ST1 clones carry a constellation of putative virulence genes not present in other Australian STs."
"Secondary Oxalate Nephropathy: A Systematic Review  2018 International Society of NephrologyIntroduction: Little is known of the clinical outcomes of secondary oxalate nephropathy. To inform clinical practice, we performed a systematic review of case reports and case series to examine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with secondary oxalate nephropathy. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for case reports and case series of individual cases or cohorts of patients with biopsy-proven oxalate nephropathy in native or transplanted kidneys from 1950 until January 2018. Results: Fifty-seven case reports and 10 case series met the inclusion criteria, totaling 108 patients. The case series were meta-analyzed. Mean age was 56.4 years old, 59% were men, and 15% were kidney transplant recipients. Fat malabsorption (88%) was the most commonly attributed cause of oxalate nephropathy, followed by excessive dietary oxalate consumption (20%). The mean baseline serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dl and peaked at 4.6 mg/dl. Proteinuria, hematuria, and urinary crystals was reported in 69%, 32%, and 26% of patients, respectively. Mean 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion was 85.4 mg/d. In addition to universal oxalate crystal deposition in tubules and/or interstitium, kidney biopsy findings included acute tubular injury (71%), tubular damage and atrophy (69%), and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration (72%); 55% of patients required dialysis. None had complete recovery, 42% had partial recovery, and 58% remained dialysis-dependent. Thirty-three percent of patients died. Conclusion: Secondary oxalate nephropathy is a rare but potentially devastating condition. Renal replacement therapy is required in >50% of patients, and most patients remain dialysis-dependent. Studies are needed for effective preventive and treatment strategies in high-risk patients with hyperoxaluria-enabling conditions."
"Mechanothermal synthesis of Ag/TiO2 for photocatalytic methyl orange degradation and hydrogen production  2018 Institution of Chemical EngineersPhotocatalysis offers a promising route to address the challenges of future energy production and anthropogenic environmental pollution. Here we demonstrated the synthesis of a high activity Ag/TiO2 photocatalyst through a two-step, sol-gel and mechanothermal decomposition method employing a silver acetate precursor. Bulk and surface characterization revealed the formation of dispersed metallic silver nanoparticles (∼9 nm diameter) decorating anatase crystallites (∼14 nm) which stabilized a significant concentration of Ti3+ surface species. Synergy between silver and titania enhanced the photophysical properties, narrowing the band gap and suppressing charge-carrier recombination. Ag/TiO2 exhibited good visible light activity and excellent stability over 3 cycles for the aqueous phase photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dye (38 μmol/h/gcat), and excellent hydrogen production from water splitting (910 μmol/h/gcat)."
"ZnO@graphene nanocomposite modified electrode for sensitive and simultaneous detection of Cd (II) and Pb (II)  2018 Elsevier B.V.Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanorods were synthesized by using zinc acetate as a precursor via thermal decomposition method and then used to prepare ZnO@G nanocomposite by facile room-temperature approach using a colloidal coagulation effect. The as prepared ZnO@G nanocomposite was applied to modify the working electrode surface in an electrochemical sensor of Cd2+ and Pb2+for the first time. The morphologies of ZnO and ZnO@G nanocomposite were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, that exhibits the nanorod shape with an average diameter of 89 ± 18 nm, uniformly dispersed and intercalated between each G layer. Furthermore, the important factors affecting on the sensor sensitivity, including ZnO@G ratio, ZnO@G concentration, Bi3+ concentration and electrochemical parameters were systematically investigated using square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry. Under the optimal conditions, a linear range was found to be 10–200 μg L−1 and the detection limits were 0.6 and 0.8 μg L-1 for Cd2+ and Pb2+, respectively. Eventually, it was successfully used for the simultaneous detection of Cd2+ and Pb2+ in real wastewater samples and the results corresponded well with a standard inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy."
"A method for extracting DNA from hard tissues for use in forensic identification  2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.With deceased and decayed bodies, personal identification is performed using hard tissue DNA, commonly extracted from bone. The quantity and quality of DNA used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification step is critical for a successful outcome. Since enamel is the strongest tissue in the human body, it was hypothesized that teeth may preserve DNA better than bones. In the present study, porcine teeth and bone samples were exposed to a variety of environments that imitated personal identification conditions, and DNA extracted from the teeth and bone samples was compared, using a PCR amplification method. The porcine teeth and bones were exposed to 11 different conditions for 5 different time periods to imitate a series of common crime scenes. DNA was extracted by a standard phenol-chloroform method. To test DNA quality, PCR was performed with primers designed to amplify porcine β-actin (ACTB) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. The results demonstrated that the quality of DNA extracted from teeth was greater than that extracted from bone in the following environments: Buried in sand, soaked in caustic soda and burnt with rubber. By contrast, the quality of DNA extracted from bone was greater than that extracted from teeth when samples were buried in soil or submerged in water. There was no discernable difference in the quality of DNA extracted from bones and teeth in several environments, including being submerged in seawater, soaked in sulfuric acid, left in open air, and stored at 4,-20 and-80˚C. Additionally, the results suggested that PCR using mtDNA primers performed better than that using ACTB primers. Finally, it was indicated that components of seawater may inhibit PCR amplification. The preliminary data reported here may provide basic guidelines for selecting the optimum source of DNA in each case."
"Canine and feline abdominal arterioportal communications can be classified based on branching patterns in computed tomographic angiography  2018 The Authors. Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American College of Veterinary RadiologyArterioportal vascular anomalies are communications between the splanchnic arteries and the portal system that represent a rare cause of presinusoidal portal hypertension in small animals. There is little information concerning the imaging findings of arterioportal communications in small animals and no classification could be found for radiologists and surgeons. The aims of this retrospective descriptive multicentric study were to describe the computed tomographic characteristics of arterioportal communications in a group of cats and dogs, and to propose a classification based on computed tomography (CT) angiographic anatomy. Computed tomography databases from multiple veterinary hospitals were searched for cats and dogs with a diagnosis of arterioportal communication. A total of 36 animals (33 dogs, three cats) met the inclusion criteria. There were 32 intrahepatic arterioportal malformations and four extrahepatic fistulae. The intrahepatic arterioportal malformations were classified as right divisional (11/32) and left divisional (21/32), and the left divisional were subclassified as left medial (16/21) and left lateral (4/21). One patient showed multiple intrahepatic arterioportal communications with concomitant left medial and left lateral conformations. Two patients with intrahepatic arteriovenous malformation showed concomitant congenital intrahepatic shunts. The proposed anatomical classification based on CT angiography could allow veterinary radiologists to have a more systematic approach and help improve the radiologist–surgeon communication."
"Search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalars in the final state of two muons and two τ leptons in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for exotic Higgs boson decays to light pseudoscalars in the final state of two muons and two τ leptons is performed using proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 15.0 and 62.5 GeV are probed, and no significant excess of data is observed above the prediction of the standard model. Upper limits are set on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to two light pseudoscalar bosons in different types of two-Higgs-doublet models extended with a complex scalar singlet.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Cloning of the full-length isoamylase3 gene from cassava Manihot esculenta Crantz ‘KU50’ and its heterologous expression in E. coli  2018 Elsevier Masson SASIsoamylase (EC.3.2.1.68), an essential enzyme in starch metabolism, catalyses the cleavage of α-1,6 glucosidic linkages of branched α-polyglucans such as beta-limit dextrin and amylopectin, but not pullulan. Three different isoamylase isoforms have been reported in plants and algae. We herein report on the first success in preparation of full-length isoamylase3 gene (MeISA3) of cassava Manihot esculenta Crantz ‘KU50’ from 5′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′ RACE). The MeISA3 was cloned to pET21b and expressed in E. coli. The HistrapTM-purified rMeISA3 appeared as a single band protein with approximate molecular size of 75 kDa on SDS-PAGE and Western blot, while 80 kDa was shown by gel filtration chromatography. This indicated the existence of a monomeric enzyme. Biochemical characterisation of rMeISA3 showed that the enzyme was specific towards beta-limit dextrin, with optimal activity at 37 °C pH 6.0. Activity of rMeISA3 could be significantly promoted by Mg2+ and Co2+. rMeISA3 debranched glucan chains of amylopectin were confirmed by HPAEC-PAD analysis."
"Efficacy of Cataract Surgery With Trabecular Microbypass Stent Implantation in Combined-Mechanism Angle Closure Glaucoma Patients  2018 Elsevier Inc.Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of trabecular microbypass stent (iStent) implantation in combined mechanism glaucoma (CMG). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: We reviewed the medical charts of patients with the following scenarios: (1) primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) undergoing phacoemulsification (PE), (2) POAG undergoing PE with iStent (POAG-PE/iStent), (3) CMG undergoing PE (CMG-PE), and (4) CMG undergoing PE with iStent (CMG-PE/iStent). CMG was defined as narrow-angle glaucoma patients whose angle had opened after iridotomy. Linear mixed-effects models were performed to determine the effect of iStent on postoperative 1-year success rate (intraocular pressure [IOP] ≤ 18 without medication), IOP, and number of medications. Results: Data from 301 eyes were available. The number of eyes (subjects) was 61 (45) in the POAG-PE, 60 (50) in POAG-PE/iStent, 93 (76) in CMG-PE, and 87 (70) in CMG-PE/iStent group. Success criteria were achieved in 13.1% for POAG-PE, 33.3% for POAG-PE/iStent (POAG-PE vs POAG-PE/iStent B 3.01; P <.001), 37.6% for CMG-PE, and 43.7% for CMG-PE/iStent (CMG-PE vs CMG-PE/iStent B 2.25; P <.001). There was no difference in the IOP between POAG-PE and POAG-PE/iStent, and between CMG-PE and CMG-PE/iStent. The iStent significantly reduced number of medications in the POAG (B −0.70; P <.001) and CMG group (B −0.52; P <.001). Comparing the effect of iStent on POAG and CMG, the analysis showed similar iStent efficacy in terms of the success rate, IOP, and number of medications (P >.05). Conclusions: Combined PE/iStent significantly increased success rate and reduced number of medications in CMG patients compared to PE alone. The effects of iStent were comparable between POAG and CMG groups."
"Height-Width Ratio of Proximal Femoral Epiphysis: Estimation of Lateral Pillar Involvement in Bilateral Perthes Disease  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Background: The standard evaluation of epiphyseal involvement in Perthes disease is lateral pillar classification. However, it needs to be compared with contralateral normal hip leading to limited use in bilateral disease. We, therefore, develop a ratio between epiphyseal height and metaphyseal width of affected hips to estimate lateral pillar involvement. This study aimed to assess the height-width ratio of the proximal femoral epiphysis in non-Perthes children, and to find the relationship between the height-width ratio and lateral pillar classification in Perthes disease. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2009 and 2015. Phase I included children aged 2 to 15 years who did not have Perthes disease. Phase II included children aged 2 to 15 years who had Perthes disease. Other abnormal proximal femoral epiphysis was excluded. Lateral pillar height and metaphyseal width were independently measured twice by 2 assessors in each phase. Intraobserver and interobserver levels of agreement, height-width ratio and cut-off points to differentiate lateral pillar types were determined. Results: There were 69 children (87 hip radiographs) who had non-Perthes hips, and 18 boys with Perthes disease (20 hip radiographs). Height-width ratio in the non-Perthes group increased from 0.38 to 0.48 at 2 to 10 years of age and remained constant until maturity. Average height-width ratio in lateral pillar A/non-Perthes hip was 0.47±0.05, lateral pillar B or B/C 0.32±0.05, and lateral pillar C 0.18±0.05. Intraobserver and interobserver level of agreements of height-width ratio in Perthes disease were 0.007 (95% confidence interval, -0.030 to 0.043) and 0.006 (95% confidence interval, -0.119 to 0.107), respectively. Cut-off values to differentiate lateral pillar A and B or B/C was 0.40, and to differentiate lateral pillar B or B/C, and C was 0.25 with 90% accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9. Conclusions: Height-width ratio is useful for grading severity in unilateral and bilateral Perthes disease. It has excellent reliability and validity with exact cutoff values to estimate lateral pillar classification. Level of Evidence: Level II - diagnostic study."
"L-arginine supplementation in sow diet during late gestation decrease stillborn piglet, increase piglet birth weight and increase immunoglobulin G concentration in colostrum  2018 Elsevier Inc.The fetal growth is rapid during the last trimester of gestation in sows and hence sow nutrition during this period is important for fetal growth and development. During the last decade, studies reported that L-arginine HCl supplementation during gestation increased sow and piglet performances. However, clinical studies concerning the association between L-arginine HCL supplementation and some neonatal piglet characteristics as well as colostrum and milk yield of sow are still lacking. The present study aims to determine the effect of L-arginine HCl supplementation in sow diet during late gestation on piglet characteristics at birth, colostrum consumption (CC), concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in colostrum, milk yield, average daily gain at d 7 and 21 and piglet mortality at d 7 and 21 of life. In total, 166 sows were allocated into four groups, i.e., CON (n = 66), ARG-0.5 (n = 42), ARG-1.0 (n = 41) and ALA (n = 17). The sows in each group were fed with a conventional gestation diet (CON) or the same diet supplemented with 0.5% L-arginine HCl (ARG-0.5), 1.0% L-arginine HCl (ARG-1.0) or 1.7% L-alanine (ALA, isonitrogenous with ARG-1.0). The feeding protocol was carried out from 85 days of gestation until farrowing. The proportion of live-born piglets, piglet birth weight (BWB), within-litter variation of BWB, proportion of piglets with BWB above 1.35 kg, proportion of growth-restricted piglets (defined as BWB below 1.0 kg), blood oxygen saturation (SatO2) and heart rate were determined in 2292 newborn piglets from 166 litters. Colostrum consumption of each individual piglets and the colostral concentration of IgG was determined. The milk yield between d 0–7 and 7–21 and relative backfat loss were estimated in each individual sow. The piglet mortality and body weight was determined at d 7 and 21 of life. On average, the number of piglet born alive per litter was 12.4. The proportion of stillborn piglets, piglets with BWB above 1.35 kg and growth-restricted piglets were 6.9%, 62.7% and 14.0%, respectively. Piglet preweaning mortality at d 7 and 21 were 8.5% and 12.4%, respectively. Compared to the ALA group, ARG-0.5 increased the proportion of live-born piglets per litter (+9.8%, P < 0.001), reduced stillborn (−8.3%, P < 0.001) and tended to increase the proportion of piglets with BWB above 1.35 kg (+6.4%, P = 0.08). Compared to the CON group, ARG-0.5 increased BWB (+7.0%, P < 0.001), increased SatO2 (+3%, P < 0.001) and reduced heart rate (−20%, P < 0.001) and tended to reduce the relative backfat loss (−4.4%, P = 0.06). No difference between ARG-1.0 and ARG-0.5 was observed among these traits. Other traits including within-litter variation of BWB, growth-restricted piglets, average daily gain, piglets preweaning mortality and CC and milk yield were not affected by treatment (P > 0.05). The colostral concentration of IgG at 1 h after onset of farrowing in ARG-1.0 sows (116 mg/ml) was higher than CON, ARG-0.5 and ALA sows (85, 74 and 78 mg/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). In conclusions, dietary L-arginine HCl supplementation in late gestating sows favourably increased proportion of live-born piglets, BWB, SatO2 and IgG concentration in the sow colostrum."
"Heat shock factor 1 regulates heat shock proteins and immune-related genes in Penaeus monodon under thermal stress  2018 Elsevier LtdHeat shock factors (HSFs) participate in the response to environmental stressors and regulate heat shock protein (Hsp) expression. This study describes the molecular characterization and expression of PmHSF1 in black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon under heat stress. PmHSF1 expression was detected in several shrimp tissues: the highest in the lymphoid organ and the lowest in the eyestalk. Significant up-regulation of PmHSF1 expression was observed in hemocytes (p < 0.05) following thermal stress. The expression of several PmHsps was rapidly induced following heat stress. Endogenous PmHSF1 protein was expressed in all three types of shrimp hemocyte and strongly induced under heat stress. The suppression of PmHSF1 expression by dsRNA-mediated gene silencing altered the expression of PmHsps, several antimicrobial genes, genes involved in the melanization process, and an antioxidant gene (PmSOD). PmHSF1 plays an important role in the thermal stress response, regulating the expression of Hsps and immune-related genes in P. monodon."
"The Asia Cornea Society Infectious Keratitis Study: A Prospective Multicenter Study of Infectious Keratitis in Asia  2018 Elsevier Inc.Purpose: To survey the demographics, risk factors, microbiology, and outcomes for infectious keratitis in Asia. Design: Prospective, nonrandomized clinical study. Methods: Thirteen study centers and 30 sub-centers recruited consecutive subjects over 12-18 months, and performed standardized data collection. A microbiological protocol standardized the processing and reporting of all isolates. Treatment of the infectious keratitis was decided by the managing ophthalmologist. Subjects were observed for up to 6 months. Main outcome measures were final visual acuity and the need for surgery during infection. Results: A total of 6626 eyes of 6563 subjects were studied. The majority of subjects were male (n = 3992). Trauma (n = 2279, 34.7%) and contact lens wear (n = 704, 10.7%) were the commonest risk factors. Overall, bacterial keratitis was diagnosed in 2521 eyes (38.0%) and fungal keratitis in 2166 eyes (32.7%). Of the 2831 microorganisms isolated, the most common were Fusarium species (n = 518, 18.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 302, 10.7%), and Aspergillus flavus (n = 236, 8.3%). Cornea transplantation was performed in 628 eyes to manage ongoing infection, but 289 grafts (46%) had failed by the end of the study. Moderate visual impairment (Snellen vision less than 20/60) was documented in 3478 eyes (53.6%). Conclusion: Demographic and risk factors for infection vary by country, but infections occur predominantly in male subjects and are frequently related to trauma. Overall, a similar percentage of bacterial and fungal infections were diagnosed in this study. Visual recovery after infectious keratitis is guarded, and corneal transplantation for active infection is associated with a high failure rate."
"Plasmolipin, PmPLP1, from Penaeus monodon is a potential receptor for yellow head virus infection  2018 Elsevier LtdPlasmolipin has been characterized as a cell entry receptor for mouse endogenous retrovirus. In black tiger shrimp, two isoforms of plasmolipin genes, PmPLP1 and PmPLP2, have been identified from the Penaeus monodon EST database. The PmPLP1 is highly up-regulated in yellow head virus (YHV)-infected shrimp. Herein, the function of PmPLP1 is shown to be involved in YHV infection. The immunoblotting and immunolocalization showed that the PmPLP1 protein was highly expressed and located at the plasma membrane of gills from YHV-infected shrimp. Moreover, the PmPLP1 expressed in the Sf9 insect cells resided at the cell membrane rendering the cells more susceptible to YHV infection. Using the ELISA binding and mortality assays, the synthetic external loop of PmPLP1 was shown to bind the purified YHV and neutralize the virus resulting in the decrease in YHV infection. Our results suggested that the PmPLP1 was likely a receptor of YHV in shrimp."
"Comparison of Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography Parameters Among Vietnamese, Chinese, and Whites  2018 Elsevier Inc.Purpose: To evaluate the difference in anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) parameters among ethnic Vietnamese, Chinese, and whites. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We prospectively recruited phakic nonglaucomatous participants (based on intraocular pressure < 21 mm Hg, normal optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber, and cup-to-disc ratio < 0.6) of 3 ethnic groups—Vietnamese, Chinese, and white. AS-OCT parameters including angle (angle opening distance, trabecular-iris space area, and angle recess area), iris (iris thickness, iris area, and iris curvature [Icurv]), and anterior chamber parameters (anterior chamber depth, width [ACW], area, and lens vault [LV]) were obtained. A linear regression model with adjustment for age, sex, axial length, and pupillary diameter was used for analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed in closed- and open-angle subgroups, which were defined in eyes with gonioscopically visible posterior trabecular meshwork for less than 2 quadrants (closed) and equal to or more than 2 quadrants (open). Results: Data were obtained from 126 Vietnamese, 124 Chinese, and 112 white participants. Mean (standard deviation) age of participants was 60.2 (11.8) years. Among overall subjects, Vietnamese had significantly smaller values in all angle and anterior chamber parameters than Chinese and white subjects (all P ≤.001) except LV. Vietnamese had significantly higher Icurv than Chinese (B −0.065, P <.001) and white subjects (B −0.073, P <.001). In the open-angle subgroup, Vietnamese had significantly smaller angle and anterior chamber dimensions (P ≤.001) and thicker iris (P <.001) than whites, whereas there was no significant difference in all parameters compared to Chinese except for smaller ACW in Vietnamese (P <.001). In the closed-angle subgroup, Vietnamese possessed smaller angle, smaller anterior chamber dimensions, and higher Icurv than Chinese and white subjects (P <.001). Vietnamese had significantly greater LV compared to Chinese (B −204.8, P =.001). Conclusion: Vietnamese subjects had more of the anatomic characteristics associated with risk for angle closure, including small anterior chamber dimension, high iris curvature, and high lens vault, compared to the other 2 ethnicities."
"The effects of disruption in membrane lipid biosynthetic genes on 1-butanol tolerance of Bacillus subtilis  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Microbes with enhanced 1-butanol tolerance have the potentials to be utilized in various biotechnological processes. To achieve the rational design of such strains, we previously conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of Bacillus subtilis under 1-butanol stress and uncovered a novel type of microbial responses as the alterations in the glycerolipid and phospholipid composition. However, the current knowledge about the relevance of these changes on 1-butanol tolerance remains quite limited. Here, we constructed the B. subtilis mutants with disruption in the pssA, ugtP (U), mprF (M), yfnI, and yfnI/mprF genes in the membrane lipid biosynthetic pathways. The 1-butanol tolerance test indicated markedly increased and decreased 1-butanol resistance in M and U compared to the wild-type strain, respectively, and slight effects in other strains under high stress level. Further examination of the lipid contents of these strains in the presence of 1-butanol by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry demonstrated an elevated ratio of neutral and anionic to cationic lipids in direct relation with an improved 1-butanol tolerance. Last, cell morphological studies showed the shortening of only the U cells, compared to the wild-type. All strains including U were capable of elongating by 14–24% under 1-butanol stress. Together, the studies indicated the involvement of membrane lipid biosynthetic genes, which regulated glycerolipid and phospholipid composition, on 1-butanol tolerance and allowed for the procurement of M with enhanced 1-butanol tolerance trait, highlighting the usefulness of the overall approaches on discovery of novel biological insights and engineering of microorganisms with desired resistance characteristics."
"Preparation of Water-in-Oil Microemulsion from the Mixtures of Castor Oil and Sunflower Oil as Makeup Remover  2018 AOCSCosmetics accumulated in facial skin are difficult to remove by ordinary cleansers because they normally contain highly waterproof ingredients. Therefore, development of makeup remover products is necessary for the efficient removal of cosmetics without irritation to the skin. Current commercial makeup removers are emulsions produced from mineral oil and water with surfactants sometimes cause allergies and acne. To overcome these problems, vegetable oils seem to be promising ingredients for makeup removers. In this study, such makeup removers were prepared as water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsion from a mixture of castor oil and sunflower oil at ratios from 1:9 to 5:5 and water with nonionic surfactants, Span®80 and Dehydol LS®TH. The remover candidates were selected with respect to transparency of emulsion and cleansing efficiency. As a result, an emulsion was prepared from a mixture of castor oil and sunflower oil with the ratio of 3:7, Dehydol LS®TH with 7 repeating units of ethylene oxide, and 7.0% (w/w) of water. It was found that the stability of transparency and a high cleansing efficiency were attributed to the hydrophilicity of the surfactant and castor oil. Dynamic light-scattering analysis demonstrated that the emulsion consisted of nanoscale micelles, resulting in a microemulsion."
"A collision resolution algorithm for RFID using modified dynamic tree with Bayesian tag estimation  1997-2012 IEEE.A new tree-based anti-collision protocol for radio-frequency identification systems is proposed to achieve a very high tag identification efficiency. The proposed algorithm works in two phases. In the first phase, the number of competing tags is estimated through the proposed Bayesian estimation technique, while in the second phase, tags are identified using our modified dynamic tree algorithm. The system efficiency is mathematically derived and verified through simulation. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a tag identification system efficiency of 45% and a time system efficiency of 78.5%, thus outperforming any existing collision resolution algorithms."

"Flow of granular materials in a bladed mixer: Effect of particle properties and process parameters on impeller torque and power consumption  2018 The Society of Powder Technology JapanThe torque and power needed to drive an impeller are important quantities that can indicate flow behavior and can be used to control processes, especially mixing and granulation in the pharmaceutical industry. In this study, experiments were conducted on monodisperse spherical glass beads flowing in a cylindrical bladed mixer agitated by an impeller. The impeller torque was measured using a rotating platform and a data recording device, and the power draw for the motor driving the impeller was measured using a power meter. The effect of various impeller blade designs and material properties on the torque and power were investigated as a function of the impeller blade rotation rate. It was found that the torque exerted on a granular bed and the power consumption were a strong function of the impeller blade configuration, the position of the blades in a deep granular bed, the fill height of the glass beads, and the size and friction coefficient of the particles. It was observed that the time-averaged torque and power consumption for different particle sizes qualitatively scaled with particle diameter. A scale-up relationship for a deep granular bed was developed: the time-averaged torque and average adjusted power consumption scaled with square of the material fill height."
"Asymmetrical coexistence of associatively and dissociatively adsorbed alcohol species over α-Fe2O3 iron oxide nanoparticles  2018The interaction of three gas phase short chain alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol) with α-Fe2O3 (hematite) nanopowder was examined using a combination of temperature programmed desorption (TPD), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a model ferric oxyhydroxide cluster. TPD analysis and FTIR spectra clearly indicated the asymmetric coexistence of associatively and dissociatively adsorbed alcohol species and different degree of surface coverages which are not only dependent of temperature but also dependent of the chemical identity of the alcohol molecule. The comprehensive analysis of IR spectra and the calculated vibrational frequencies for adsorbed alcohols obtained through DFT modeling suggest that the mechanistic pathway for alcohol chemisorption over α-Fe2O3 surfaces is regulated by the presence of accessible coordinately unsaturated Fe sites. A linear correlation between the Brønsted acidity of the alcohol and the ratio of associatively/dissociatively adsorbed species on the α-Fe2O3 surface is reported."
"Photosynthetic responses and identification of salt tolerance genes in a chromosome segment substitution line of ‘Khao dawk Mali 105’ rice  2018 Elsevier B.V.The rice chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) with a ‘Khao Dawk Mali 105’ (‘KDML105’) genetic background and the putative drought tolerance genetic region of DH212 chromosome 1, were evaluated for salt tolerance. Lines CSSL11, CSSL12, and CSSL16 containing the full putative salt tolerance genetic region were compared with the parental lines, ‘KDML105’ and DH212. The CSSL16 plants were significantly more salt-tolerant than the ‘KDML105’ rice plants. Therefore, the CSSL16 and ‘KDML105’ genome sequences were compared to identify additional potential introgressed regions. The major regions that differed between the two lines were located on chromosomes 1, 4, and 7. To identify candidate “major effect” genes, the different loci between CSSL16 and ‘KDML105’ plants were subjected to a co-expression network analysis, which detected 10 major hub genes. Six of these genes were determined to function in chloroplasts. The PsbS1 expression patterns were similar in CSSL16 and DH212 plants, but differed from that of ‘KDML105’ plants. Rice PsbS1 is a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana CP22, which encodes a protein that binds to chlorophylls a and b. CP22 is localized in photosystem II and is responsible for non-photochemical quenching activities. Thus, the salt tolerance of knocked-out Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines lacking CP22 was assessed. A mutation in CP22 increased the susceptibility of the mutant lines to salt stress. The cp22 mutants also exhibited decreased quantum yield efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and inhibited growth relative to the wild-type plants grown under salt stress conditions. These results suggest that rice PsbS1 is important for the adaptability and maintenance of photosynthetic activities in salt-stressed rice plants."
"New insights into neurocutaneous melanosis  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Background: Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare disorder in which children with large cutaneous melanotic nevi have associated melanosis in the brain. Although many affected children have structurally normal brains, some have associated developmental disorders or brain anomalies. Objectives: To determine the range of extent of brain melanosis as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to investigate the frequency and types of associated brain anomalies. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed brain and spine MRIs of 80 patients with congenital melanocytic nevi (range: 1 day to 22 years of age) affiliated with Nevus Outreach Inc. from 1998 to 2017. Central nervous system (CNS) melanosis was diagnosed when a mass with abnormal parenchymal T1 hyperintensity was seen. The locations of abnormal signal, associated malformations, the presence of contrast enhancement and, in patients with more than one MRI, changes over time were recorded. Associations among findings were analyzed using chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Results: Brain abnormalities were identified in 33 patients. The most common finding was melanosis in the amygdala, which was found in 31 patients (an isolated finding in 14 patients). Nineteen patients had melanosis in the brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex or thalamus. Cerebral and/or spinal leptomeningeal enhancement was uncommon (five patients). Hindbrain melanosis was associated with cerebellar and pontine hypoplasia (P=0.012). Brain melanosis was most easily seen on T1 images prior to myelination; reduced/loss of visibility was noted as the CNS matured. Conclusion: Brain melanosis is a common manifestation in children with large cutaneous melanotic nevi, most commonly found in the anterior temporal lobes (amygdala), brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Hindbrain melanosis is associated with hypoplasia of the affected structures. Early imaging is optimal to provide the greatest sensitivity for diagnosis and to guide proper management."
"Universum Selection for Boosting the Performance of Multiclass Support Vector Machines Based on One-versus-One Strategy  2018 Elsevier B.V.We propose a novel framework to enhance the performance of the one-versus-one support vector machine by using Universum. For solving a multiclass classification problem, one-versus-one is one of the state-of-the-art algorithms, which constructs N(N−1)/2 binary classifiers for an N-class problem. Each binary classifier is originally learned by two classes of data as positive and negative classes while the other N−2 remaining classes are ignored, even if they might also represent a hidden concept of the application domain and can help to boost the performance of the classifier. Vapnik et al. [20, 21] introduced Universum binary support vector machines to enable the use of samples that do not belong to positive and negative classes and called these samples Universum samples. However, not all Universum samples can be helpful; moreover, improper selection of Universum samples can prevent the construction of an effective binary classifier. For the construction of a Universum binary classifier in the one-versus-one strategy, there are 2N−2 candidate subsets of classes of Universum data; a proper selection of them can be difficult, based on the number of classes. We design an algorithm to obtain a suitable subset of classes of Universum data by applying the proposed performance measure that reflects the properties of Universum data relative to labeled training data. This measure is based on the analysis of the projection of Universum data onto the normal direction vector of the standard binary SVM hyperplane. We demonstrate experimentally that our proposed strategy outperforms existing methods."
"Recovery potential of cellulose fiber from newspaper waste: An approach on magnetic cellulose aerogel for dye adsorption material  2018 Elsevier B.V.In this study, we have attempted to extract cellulose fiber from newspaper waste for circular economy project. Cellulose was successfully extracted from newspaper waste with high purity. It was further developed as a composite with Fe3O4 powder. 10–30 wt% of Fe3O4 was synthesized from conventional synthetic route and it was uniformly distributed into cellulose suspension. The composite was prepared by freeze-dry technique in order to remove water and create the porosity. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis were employed to characterize the structural and thermal properties of composite. Scanning electron microscope with energy dispersion analysis can be confirmed that uniformity of cellulose and the existence of Fe3O4 powder. Frequency dependence of dielectric properties was used to imply the polarity enhancement of composite. Preliminary adsorption of composite as adsorbent material for Congo red was investigated."
"Amelogenesis imperfecta: A novel FAM83H mutation and characteristics of periodontal ligament cells  2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reservedObjective: To delineate orodental features, dental mineral density, genetic aetiology and cellular characteristics associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). Materials and Methods: Three affected patients in a family were recruited. Whole-exome sequencing was used to identify mutations confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The proband's teeth were subjected for mineral density analysis by microcomputerised tomography and characterisation of periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs). Results: The patients presented yellow-brown, pitted and irregular enamel. A novel nonsense mutation, c.1261G>T, p.E421*, in exon 5 of the FAM83H was identified. The mineral density of the enamel was significantly decreased in the proband. The patient's PDLCs (FAM83H cells) exhibited reduced ability of cell proliferation and colony-forming unit compared with controls. The formation of stress fibres was remarkably present. Upon cultured in osteogenic induction medium, FAM83H cells, at day 7 compared to day 3, had a significant reduction of BSP, COL1 and OCN mRNA expression and no significant change in RUNX2. The upregulation of ALP mRNA levels and mineral deposition were comparable between FAM83H and control cells. Conclusions: We identified the novel mutation in FAM83H associated with autosomal dominant hypocalcified AI. The FAM83H cells showed reduced cell proliferation and expression of osteogenic markers, suggesting altered PDLCs in FAM83H-associated AI."
"Structure–antioxidant activity relationship of β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes with olive tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein: Deep insights from X-ray analysis, DFT calculation and DPPH assay  2018 Elsevier LtdOlives and olive oil, a key food type of the Mediterranean diets, are packed with various important polyphenols including oleuropein (OLE), hydroxytyrosol (HTY) and tyrosol (TYR). OLE and HTY are highly powerful antioxidants and play a prime role in the therapeutics of free radical-related diseases. Their molecular stabilities and antioxidant properties can be improved by cyclodextrin (CD) encapsulation. Here, we present a systematic investigation on the inclusion complexes of β-CD–TYR (1), β-CD–HTY (2) and β-CD–OLE (3) by combined single-crystal structure determination, DFT complete-geometry optimization and DPPH antioxidant assay. X-ray analysis and DFT calculation reveal the preference of inclusion geometry with deep protrusion of the aromatic ring moieties of TYR, HTY and OLE from the β-CD O6–H-side, and the common host-guest stabilization scheme via intermolecular O–H⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions. No polyphenol OH group is shielded in the β-CD cavity, in contrast to the structures of β-CD–tea catechins complexes. The established host-guest O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds help to elevate antioxidant capacities of the olive polyphenols upon β-CD encapsulation. The order of antioxidant activity 2 > 3 ≫ 1 based on the DPPH measurement is in fair agreement with their relative thermodynamic stabilities derived from DFT calculation."
"Isolation and expression analysis of Bystin 1 transcript and protein during ovarian development of the giant tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon  2018 Elsevier Inc.The full-length cDNA of bystin isoform 1 (PmBys1) of the giant tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon was characterized. It was 1553 bp in length containing an ORF of 1365 bp corresponding to a polypeptide of 454 amino acids. The level of PmBys1 mRNA in ovaries was greater than that in other tissues of females and in testes of males in both juveniles and wild broodstock (P <.05). In non-ablated wild female broodstock, PmBys1 mRNA significantly and progressively increased in ovaries from stage I of development, peaking at stage IV (P <.05). Its level in stages I-IV of eyestalk-ablated broodstock was greater than that in non-ablated broodstock (P <.05). Injection of exogenous serotonin (50 μg/g body weight) into 18-month-old shrimp resulted in a significantly increase of ovarian PmBys1 mRNA at 6–48 h post injection (hpi) (P <.05). PmBys1 protein (52 kDa) was found in ovarian stages I-V of non-ablated wild broodstock and II-IV of ablated wild broodstock, respectively. Along with the 52 kDa band, immunoreactive bands of 50 and 43 kDa were also observed in ovarian stages II-IV of both non-ablated and ablated broodstock and in ovaries of post-spawning broodstock. The 43 KDa band was not observed in ovarian stage I of wild female broodstock or in premature juveniles. PmBys1 protein was localized in the ooplasm of previtellogenic oocytes, nucleo-cytoplasmic compartments of vitellogenic oocytes and cortical rods of mature oocytes in wild broodstock. The results implied a possible role for PmBys1 during ovarian development in P. monodon."
"Enhancement of lipid production in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 overexpressing glycerol kinase under oxidative stress with glycerol supplementation  2018 Elsevier LtdIn this study, the effect of glycerol kinase overexpression in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 on lipid content was investigated. The glycerol kinase overexpressing Synechocystis cells (OE) had a higher lipid content than the wild type. The OE treated with phenol up to 1 mM showed a slight increase in the cell biomass whereas the total lipid production increased considerably (0.39 ± 0.012 g/L) as compared to that of the wild type (0.26 ± 0.01 g/L). The supplementation of 12 g/L glycerol to BG11 medium increased the lipid content of phenol treated OE from 22 to 35% with the increase of lipid production from 0.39 ± 0.012 to 0.69 ± 0.035 g/L. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of glpK was upregulated from 1.3 to 2.4 and from 1.89 to 3.64-fold after phenol treatment and glycerol supplementation respectively."
"Analysis of seismic ground response caused during strong earthquake in Northern Thailand  2018 Elsevier LtdThis paper presents a site-specific analysis of ground response during the Tarlay Earthquake on March 24, 2011 in Northern Thailand. In this study, the NGA (Next Generation Attenuation) models were selected to predict ground motions due to the earthquake event. The equivalent linear and non-linear approaches were employed in the one-dimensional ground response analysis. Furthermore, the spectral responses produced by the equivalent linear and non-linear approaches were compared with the seismic design code of Thailand. The results showed that the ground motion from the NGA models agree with the strong motion parameters of Tarlay Earthquake. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) at ground surface obtained from both equivalent linear and non-linear approaches certainly results in the high amplification factor. In general, the study results could bring an attention to the local engineer to consider the seismic design value for Northern Thailand, particularly if the stronger earthquake happens in the future."
"Variation in intronic microsatellites and exon 2 of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene during modification of artemisinin combination therapy in Thailand  2018The amino acid substitution at residue 76 of the food vacuolar transmembrane protein encoded by the chloroquine resistance transporter gene of Plasmodium falciparum (Pfcrt) is an important, albeit imperfect, determinant of chloroquine susceptibility status of the parasite. Other mutations in Pfcrt can modulate susceptibility of P. falciparum to other antimalarials capable of interfering with heme detoxification process, and may exert compensatory effect on parasite growth rate. To address whether nationwide implementation of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in Thailand could affect sequence variation in exon 2 and introns of Pfcrt, we analyzed 136 P. falciparum isolates collected during 1997 and 2016 from endemic areas bordering Myanmar, Cambodia and Malaysia. Results revealed 6 haplotypes in exon 2 of Pfcrt with 2 novel substitutions at c.243A > G (p.R81) and c.251A > T (p.N84I). Positive selection was observed at amino acid residues 75, 76 and 97. Four, 3, and 2 alleles of microsatellite (AT/TA) repeats occurred in introns 1, 2 and 4, respectively, resulting in 7 different 3-locus haplotypes. The number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity of exon 2, and introns 1, 2 and 4 were significantly greater among isolates collected during 2009 and 2016 than those collected during 1997 and 2008 when 3-day ACT and 2-day ACT regimens were implemented nationwide, respectively (p < 0.05). By contrast, the number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity of the merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 of these parasite populations did not differ significantly between these periods. Therefore, the Pfcrt locus of P. falciparum in Thailand continues to evolve and could have been affected by selective pressure from modification of ACT regimen."
"Do Listeners Perceive Interviewers’ Attributes from their Voices and Do Perceptions Differ by Question Type?  The Author(s) 2018.As an aural mode, an interviewer’s voice is an important part of telephone surveys. A speaker’s voice can convey information about his or her trustworthiness and confidence, among other attributes. Consequently, respondents may perceive attributes of interviewers from their voices. We evaluated how five perceived attributes of interviewers (expertise, confidence, reliability, trustworthiness, and easiness to understand) are associated with interviewer voice characteristics (pitch, intonation, speech rate, and disfluencies) and whether this varies by types of question and interviewer characteristics. Overall, listeners perceived interviewers’ attributes from their voices. Interviewers with higher pitched voices, moderate intonation, a faster pace, and fewer disfluencies were rated more positively, but these ratings differed somewhat for socially undesirable and complex questions. Reading questions at the recommended speech rate of two words per second leads to negative perceptions of interviewers."
"Characterization of transforming growth factor beta regulator 1-like and association between its expression levels and growth of the giant tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon  2018 Elsevier Inc.Molecular markers that allow selection of juveniles and broodstock with improved growth performances are useful for the shrimp industry. Here, the full-length cDNA of transforming growth factor beta regulator 1-like (PmTbrg1-l) in the giant tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon was determined. It was 1184 bp in length and contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 975 bp corresponding to a deduced polypeptide of 324 amino acids. Successful RNA interference (RNAi) carried out using juveniles injected with PmTbrg1-l dsRNA revealed reduced levels of PmTbrg1-l and myostatin (PmMstm) in hemocytes when compared to shrimp injected with saline solution and GFP dsRNA (P <.05). Associations between single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) patterns or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) patterns and growth-related parameters (average body weight and total length) were examined. Juveniles with pattern III (corresponding to A/A918; N = 37) showed a trend for greater average body weight and total length than those with patterns II (G/G918; N = 42) and IV (A/G918; N = 75). The expression level of PmTbrg1-l in the hepatopancreas of females was significantly higher than that in males (P <.05) in two sample sets of three-month-old domesticated juveniles (N = 59 and 50; P <.05). Moreover, its expression level in large-size juveniles was significantly higher than that in medium-size and small-size juveniles in both groups of samples (P <.05). Results indicated that PmTbrg1-l is functionally related with growth of P. monodon."

"Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing - A novel high-throughput method for subtyping Listeria strains  2018Listeria monocytogenes is significantly associated with listeriosis infection. Several species of Listeria other than L. monocytogenes directly affect the food industry. In the present study we developed a novel subtyping method for tracking the source of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua in large-scale investigations using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Forty-eight L. monocytogenes and L. innocua strains isolated from a food processing plant and the environment were used for the amplification of 15 specific variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci. The results exhibited 100% concordance for amplicon detection using both the subtyping methods. Coupling of MLVA with capillary electrophoresis (CE) or NGS detected 38 and 89 different alleles, respectively. MLVA coupled with NGS showed significantly higher discriminating power than MLVA coupled with CE. In MLVA coupled with NGS method, locus JLR1 of L. monocytogenes had 54% discrimination while locus TR3 had 100% discrimination solely in L. innocua. In addition, MLVA coupled with NGS method had significantly higher discrimination power (DI = 1.0 with 48 MLVA patterns) than that of MLVA coupled with CE (DI = 0.79 with 15 MLVA patterns). These results indicate the advantage of MLVA coupled with NGS method in detecting not only the length but also sequence polymorphism in a single read run. MLVA coupled with NGS led to significant reduction in labor and cost than CE and the traditional Sanger sequencing. Thus, MLVA coupled with NGS is an effective and feasible technique for the molecular typing of Listeria species in food industries."
"Fabrication and characterization of chitosan-titanium dioxide nanocomposite film as ethylene scavenging and antimicrobial active food packaging  2018 Elsevier LtdActive packaging from nanocomposite of chitosan and nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO2) to be used as an ethylene scavenging and antimicrobial film was developed. Chitosan films containing different TiO2 concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2% w/w) were fabricated and characterized for structural, mechanical, optical and barrier properties. The scanning electron microscope images showed that TiO2 nanoparticles evenly distributed in the chitosan film matrix. However, the spontaneous agglomeration of the TiO2 was observed at high TiO2 concentrations. The X–Ray diffraction patterns presented that crystallinity of TiO2 in the nanocomposite films increased with TiO2 concentration. The Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that there were hydrogen bonding and O-Ti-O bonding between TiO2 and chitosan, which affected the tensile strength, elongation at break, and water vapor barrier properties of the films. The chitosan-TiO2 nanocomposites exhibited ethylene photodegradation which increased with increasing TiO2 concentration. Based on tensile strength, water barrier and ethylene photocatalytic degradation properties, chitosan film containing 1% TiO2 (CT1) was found to be optimal and hence was selected for antimicrobial evaluation. The results suggested that the CT1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria and fungi (Aspergillus and Penicillium)."
"Human papillomavirus-related multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma: First case report associated with an intermediate-risk HPV type and literatures review  2018HPV-related Multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma (previously known as HPV-related carcinoma with adenoid cystic carcinoma-like features) is very rare tumor of which only 55 cases are reported. All cases to date are related to high-risk types of HPV including 16, 31, 33, 35 and 56. We report of a case of a nasal mass in a 50-year-old female. Biopsy demonstrated typical features of an HPV-related multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma, with both basaloid and ductal type cells. Tumor cells were arranged in lobulated sheets, with focal cribriform and microcystic growth patterns. The majority of tumor cells expressed myoepithelial markers (S-100 protein, smooth muscle actin and p63) and the ductal cells were immunopositive for CD117. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing identified HPV type 26. HPV 26 becomes the first intermediate risk type that may be associated with HPV-related multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma."
"Polymeric materials and films in dentistry: An overview  2018The use of polymeric materials (PMs) and polymeric films (PMFs) has increased in medicine and dentistry. This increasing interest is attributed to not only the excellent surfaces of PMs and PMFs but also their desired mechanical and biological properties, low production cost, and ease in processing, allowing them to be tailored for a wide range of applications. Specifically, PMs and PMFs are used in dentistry for their antimicrobial, drug delivery properties; in preventive, restorative and regenerative therapies; and for corrosion and friction reduction. PMFs such as acrylic acid copolymers are used as a dental adhesive; polylactic acids are used for dental pulp and dentin regeneration, and bioactive polymers are used as advanced drug delivery systems. The objective of this article was to review the literatures on the latest advancements in the use of PMs and PMFs in medicine and dentistry. Published literature (1990–2017) on PMs and PMFs for use in medicine and dentistry was reviewed using MEDLINE/PubMed and ScienceDirect resources. Furthermore, this review also explores the diversity of latest PMs and PMFs that have been utilized in dental applications, and analyzes the benefits and limitations of PMs and PMFs. Most of the PMs and PMFs have shown to improve the biomechanical properties of dental materials, but in future, more clinical studies are needed to create better treatment guidelines for patients."
"Photocatalytic activity of TiO2 coated porous silica beads on degradation of cumene hydroperoxide  2018 The American Ceramic SocietyRecently, due to an increasing global concern on environmental safety, titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalyst has been extensively researched for use as air and water pollution treatments. This study was initiative for producing an economically viable TiO2 photocatalyst material with recyclability for degradation of CHP contaminated wastewater. TiO2 P-25, a well-known photocatalyst, with a proper amount (15% w/w of CAC) was coated on porous silica beads (ECOLITE®) by granulation technique, using high calcium aluminate cement (CAC) as a binder (EC+CAC+15% w/w TiO2 P-25). The experiments revealed that high concentration CHP solutions were completely degraded by EC+CAC+15% w/w TiO2 P-25 within 5 and 7 hours. The recyclability of EC+CAC+15% w/w TiO2 P-25 was evaluated by investigation the degradation activity of freshly prepared CHP solution under UV light irradiation using the repetitive photocatalyst beads for 6 runs. HPLC analyses indicated that the CHP degradation was completed in the 1st run and down to over 90% in the 6th run. Hence, EC+CAC+15% w/w TiO2 P-25 showed a long durability and good recyclability for CHP degradation, resulted from the good adherence of hydration product layer of CAC for TiO2 particles as well as its large surface area that offered good adsorption for CHP."
"Regulation Multiple: Pharmaceutical Trajectories and Modes of Control in the ASEAN  2018 SAGE Publications.This article revisits the conceptualisation of pharmaceutical regulation. While States and multilateral organisations play a central part in devising rules, regulation as a social practice extends beyond their role. Domestic and international interests, geopolitics and spatial configurations, commercial and health considerations, governmental policies and individual behaviours and legal and illegal transactions all contribute to regulating the pharmaceutical milieu. This consideration expands the epistemological range of pharmaceutical regulation, which then appears as the assemblage of heterogeneous laws, rules and codes of conducts. The way in which these layers are connected forms what regulation actually is in practice. Regulation multiple thus appears as the product of tensions between harmonisation efforts and persistent diversity, as well as the result of interactions and overlaps between official regulation and unofficial regulatory practices. This article explores these tensions in the Southeast Asian pharmaceutical market along three themes: circuits and logistic regimes; control and attention to quality; bridges and harmonisations."
"Widespread and debilitating hemangiomas in a patient with enchondromatosis and D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria  2018, ISS.Metaphyseal chondromatosis with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (MC-HGA) (OMIM 614875) is a severe chondrodysplasia combined with a urinary excretion of D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid. Here, we reported the tenth case of this disease. A 15-year-old boy had symmetric radiolulencies in the metaphyses of the long bones suggesting enchondromatosis and platyspondyly. Remarkably, he manifested widespread cavernous hemangiomas including scalp, lips, tongue, larynx, and prepuce, with the onset of 3 years of age. Hemangiomas at the larynx had caused dyspnea and those in the oral cavity led to recurrent bleeding, requiring several surgical removals. These multiple and debilitating hemangiomas have never been previously reported in patients with MC-HGA. Mutation analyses including Sanger sequencing of genes involving in enchondromatosis and the metabolic pathway of D-2-hydroxyglutarate including PTHR1, D2HGDH, HOT, and IDH1, as well as whole-exome sequencing for proband-parent trio analysis and paired blood versus hemangioma studies showed no pathogenic variants. In summary, we reported the tenth patient with MC-HGA who manifested widespread and debilitating hemangiomas in several organs, expanding the clinical spectrum of MC-HGA."
"Death Acceptance in Vietnamese Cancer Patients: A Phenomenological Study  The Author(s) 2018.Introduction: To date, death acceptance is not well investigated in the Vietnamese population. Cultural influences may affect death acceptance. The purpose of this phenomenological study is to describe Vietnamese cancer patients’ lived experience with death acceptance. Method: Eleven Vietnamese patients with various cancer diagnoses participated in the study. Data were analyzed using the Giorgian method of data analysis. Results: Themes of death acceptance found were (1) accepting destiny, (2) knowing and sacrificing the self, (3) believing in living persons and handing over responsibilities, (4) accepting death while continuing to fight for life, and (5) looking for a “role model death.” Discussion: Death acceptance is a contextually bound concept, which needs further investigation. To help patients with their death acceptance, nurses should include spiritual support and the involvement of loved ones in patients’ care plans."
"Are Internet message boards used to facilitate stock price manipulation? Evidence from an emerging market, Thailand  2018 AFAANZThe impact of messages posted on the top three financial discussion boards in Thailand is investigated using an event study approach. Heightened message board posting activity for small firms is associated with a strong pre-event share price run-up over many days and a partial post-event return reversal, consistent with manipulative activity whereby traders sometimes ‘talk up’ small-firm prospects on message boards and then dump them. Close to 90 percent of the price falls associated with bad discussion board news get reversed within 75 days, consistent with short sellers utilising heightened self-serving message board activity when targeting companies for short selling."
"How do powerful CEOs view dividends and stock repurchases? Evidence from the CEO pay slice (CPS)  2018 Elsevier Inc.Agency theory suggests that CEOs view dividends unfavorably because dividend payouts deprive them of the free cash flow they could otherwise exploit. Using Bebchuk, Cremers, and Peyer's (2011) CEO pay slice (CPS) to measure CEO power, we find that an increase in CEO power by one standard deviation decreases the probability of paying dividends by 17.48%. For dividend-paying firms, a rise in CEO power by one standard deviation reduces the size of dividend payouts by 5.91%. Share repurchases, however, are not influenced by CEO power, although they too take away the free cash flow from the CEO."
"Comparative study on different turning device alignments for household food waste composters  2018 American Institute of Chemical EngineersIn this study, two in-vessel composters with a turning device aligned horizontally or vertically were compared for their performances in composting food waste. Both composters were operated in batch mode at the fixed temperature of 55–60°C, and biological digestion was allowed to take place for 6 days. Both composters exhibited comparable performance with similar CO2 evolution characteristics and similar composted food waste properties, including moisture content, C:N ratio, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH. However, the reactor with the horizontal agitator provided a better stability of the final product, as the product from the vertical composter had traces of post-anaerobic reaction.  2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1901–1907, 2018."
"Who supports intergenerational redistribution policy? Evidence from old-age allowance system in Thailand  2017 Elsevier B.V.Thailand has become an ageing society, and currently there are continuing policy debates regarding the pension system. This paper investigates the determinants of preferences over an intergenerational redistribution policy in Thailand, namely the old-age allowance system. Since 2009 the old-age allowance system has been a non-contributory social pension scheme for all older persons except retired national and local government officials who receive pension monthly and older persons in public residential care facilities. The paper uses nationally representative data collected in 2011 under the project to investigate people's knowledge of, and attitudes towards, the elderly. Employing logistic regression analysis, the paper looks into the factors correlated with: (1) whether an individual prefers the old-age allowance system to be universal or targeted, and (2) whether an individual is willing to pay more tax so that the elderly can receive more monthly allowance. The paper further divides the individuals into four groups based on the above two types of preferences, and uses multinomial logistic regression analysis to analyze the factors correlated with the likelihood of being in each group. The findings suggest that education, income, expectations regarding one's own need for the old-age allowance in the future, together with knowledge, understanding, and attitudes towards older persons are key determinants of individuals’ preferences regarding the old-age allowance system."
"Identifying factors associated with need for flexible ureteroscope repair: a Western Endourology STone (WEST) research consortium prospective cohort study  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Maintenance of flexible ureteroscopes can involve high costs and administrative burden. Instrument fragility necessitates eventual repair, rendering scopes inaccessible during refurbishment. We conducted a multi-institutional prospective cohort study to identify perioperative factors influencing flexible ureteroscope durability. Patients undergoing flexible ureteroscopy (URS) at six United States endourology centers were enrolled between August 2014 and June 2015. Surgeon self-reported concern and satisfaction with scope performance as well as upward and downward angles of deflection for each scope tip were measured before and after each procedure. The need for scope repair was determined by the operating surgeon at the time of the procedure and recorded. 424 URS cases using 74 flexible ureteroscopes were identified. Scope repair was required in 28 cases (6.6%) involving 26 scopes (35.1%). Upon univariate analysis, shorter patient height, absence of guidewire use, presence of a ureteral access sheath (UAS), longer procedure time, larger stone size, lithotrite type, surgeon training level, and self-reported concern were associated with scope repair. Upon multivariate analysis, UAS use (OR = 2.53, p = 0.005) and degree loss of scope upward flexion during a case (OR = 1.02, p = 0.03) increased the odds of a scope needing repair while the use of safety guidewire decreased the odds of a scope repair (OR = 0.50, p = 0.045). Lithotrite use and surgeon concern were associated with degree loss of scope upward flexion. The use of a UAS, absence of a safety guidewire, and the loss of upward ureteroscope flexion should be considered when evaluating means of optimizing reusable ureteroscope durability."
"Wave Correction Scheme for Task Space Control of Time-Varying Delayed Teleoperation Systems  1993-2012 IEEE.This brief presents a novel method in wave variable approach for controlling the SE(3) task space manipulation of the teleoperation system over time-varying delayed communication. The scheme modulates typical wave commands using corrective waves to address the motion/effort mismatch largely caused by time-varying delay and environmental impedance. These corrections are computed based on the difference between the desired and fictitious poses obtained from integrating/propagating nondistorted wave variables. Resulting waves ensure the pose and, moreover, effort tracking of the teleoperation system under appropriate conditions. Passivity of the system is guaranteed by the nonnegative power dissipation constraint on the corrective wave signals, or by the help of dissipative elements in the controllers. Therefore, the scheme may be integrated to the master/slave robots controlled with passive motion/force controllers. Specific application to the teleoperation system with the proportional-derivative controllers is studied."
"Precision measurement of the structure of the CMS inner tracking system using nuclear interactions  2018 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.The structure of the CMS inner tracking system has been studied using nuclear interactions of hadrons striking its material. Data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded in 2015 at the LHC are used to reconstruct millions of secondary vertices from these nuclear interactions. Precise positions of the beam pipe and the inner tracking system elements, such as the pixel detector support tube, and barrel pixel detector inner shield and support rails, are determined using these vertices. These measurements are important for detector simulations, detector upgrades, and to identify any changes in the positions of inactive elements."
"The effect of polymyxin B hemoperfusion on modulation of human leukocyte antigen DR in severe sepsis patients  2018 The Author(s).Background: Recent randomized trials have not found that polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) improves outcomes for patients with sepsis. However, it remains unclear whether the therapy could provide benefit for highly selected patients. Monocyte human leukocyte antigen (mHLA-DR) expression, a critical step in the immune response, is decreased during sepsis and leads to worsening sepsis outcomes. One recent study found that PMX-HP increased mHLA-DR expression while another found that the treatment removed HLA-DR-positive cells. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in patients with blood endotoxin activity assay (EAA) level ≥ 0.6. Patients in the PMX-HP group received a 2-h PMX-HP treatment plus standard treatment for 2 consecutive days. Patients in the non-PMX-HP group received only standard treatment. The primary outcome compared the groups on median change in mHLA-DR expression between day 3 and baseline. Secondary outcomes compared the groups on the mean or median change in CD11b expression, neutrophil chemotaxis, presepsin, cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (CVS SOFA) score, vasopressor dose, and EAA level between day 3 and baseline. We further compared the groups on mortality, ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, dialysis dependence status, renal recovery, serum creatinine, vasopressor-free days, and major adverse kidney events (MAKE 28), measured on day 28. Results: Fifty-nine patients were randomized to PMX-HP (n = 29) and non-PMX-HP (n = 30) groups. At baseline, mHLA-DR expression, CD11b, neutrophil chemotaxis, and clinical parameters were comparable between groups. The median change in mHLA-DR expression between day 3 and baseline was higher in PMX-HP patients than in patients receiving standard therapy alone (P = 0.027). The mean change in CD11b between day 3 and baseline was significantly lower in the PMX-HP group than in the non-PMX-HP group (P = 0.002). There were no significant changes from baseline in neutrophil chemotaxis, presepsin, CVS SOFA scores, vasopressor doses, or EAA level between groups. On day 28 after enrollment, mortality, ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, dialysis dependence status, renal recovery, serum creatinine, vasopressor-free days, and MAKE 28 were comparable between groups. Conclusion: PMX-HP improved mHLA-DR expression in severe sepsis patients. Future studies should examine the potential benefit of PMX-HP in patients with low mHLA-DR expression. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02413541. Registered on 3 March 2015."
"Biotransformation of β-Mangostin by an Endophytic Fungus of Garcinia mangostana to Furnish Xanthenes with an Unprecedented Heterocyclic Skeleton  2018 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.Biotransformation of β-mangostin (1) by the endophytic fungus Xylaria feejeensis GM06 afforded hexacyclic ring-fused xanthenes with an unprecedented hexacyclic heterocylic skeleton. β-Mangostin (1) was transformed to two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers, mangostafeejin A [(-)-2a/(+)-2b)] and mangostafeejin B [(-)-3a/(+)-3b)]. The chemical structures of the transformation products were elucidated by analysis of NMR and MS data, and the structure of mangostafeejin A [(-)-2a/(+)-2b)] was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The absolute configurations of 3a and 3b were established on the basis of calculated and measured ECD data using the ECD spectra of 2a and 2b as models. The fungal biotransformation described herein provides an effective method to convert an abundant achiral plant natural product scaffold into new chiral heterocyclic scaffolds representing expanded chemical diversity for biological activity screening."
"Pathologic Replication-Independent Endogenous DNA Double-Strand Breaks Repair Defect in Chronological Aging Yeast  Copyright  2018 Pongpanich, Patchsung and Mutirangura.Reduction of physiologic replication-independent endogenous DNA double strand breaks (Phy-RIND-EDSBs) in chronological aging yeast increases pathologic RIND-EDSBs (Path-RIND-EDSBs). Path-RIND-EDSBs can occur spontaneously in non-dividing cells without any inductive agents, and they must be repaired immediately otherwise their accumulation can lead to senescence. If yeasts have DSB repair defect, retention of Path-RIND-EDSBs can be found. Previously, we found that Path-RIND-EDSBs are not only produced but also retained in chronological aging yeast. Here, we evaluated if chronological aging yeasts have a DSB repair defect. We found a significant accumulation of Path-RIND-EDSBs around the same level in aging cells and caffeine treated cells and at a much higher level in the DSB repair mutant cells. Especially in the mutant, some unknown sequence was found inserted at the breaks. In addition, % difference of cell viability between HO induced and non-induced cells was significantly greater in aging cells. Our results suggested that RIND-EDSBs repair efficiency declines, but is not absent, in chronological aging yeast which might promote senescence phenotype. When a repair protein is deficient, an alternative pathway might be employed or an end modification process might occur as inserted sequences at the breaks were observed. Restoring repair defects might slow down the deterioration of cells from chronological aging."
"Carrier-Based Realization of Arbitrary Space-Vector PWM Methods for Three-Level Inverters  2018 IEEJ Industry Application Society.Various space-vector modulation methods developed for three-level inverters require complicated calculation. Some researches attempt to solve this problem using a carrier-based modulation with the addition of appropriate zero voltages. However, to find the equivalent carrier-based realization is not always easy, especially for those space-vector modulations which include dipolar switching mode. This paper proposes a systematic procedure to derive an equivalent carrier-based modulation for an arbitrary space-vector modulation by decomposition of voltage commands and addition of generalized zero voltages. The proposed procedure is based on two key mathematical concepts 1) the barycentric coordinates for space-vector calculation and 2) the generalized dipolar modulation concept. Experimental results are given to prove the correctness of the proposed carrier-based algorithm."
"Novel Three-Level Back-to-Back Converters: Structure, Modulation Method, and Experiment  2018 IEEJ Industry Application Society.Novel three-level back-to-back converters with symmetrical dc-link structure are proposed for bidirectional and unidirectional power applications. The new converters combine a non-PWM rectifier with a PWM inverter to cooperatively control both the output voltage and the input current. The non-PWM rectifier significantly reduces switching losses and EMI noises at the input as compared to the PWM rectifier of the conventional back-to-back converters. Modulation methods are derived for the proposed converters to obtain the required output voltage, input power factor control, and switching loss reduction. Experimental results are given to verify the key characteristics of the proposed converters."
"A Common-Mode Voltage Reduction for Two-Stage Three-Phase Transformerless PV Inverters  2018 IEEJ Industry Application Society.This paper presents a common-mode voltage cancellation method for two-stage transformerless string PV inverters. The exact common-mode equivalent circuit is firstly modeled to exhibit simultaneously the instantaneous common-mode voltages of boost DC-DC converter and three-phase two-level inverter. The selection of zero voltage for PWM inverter is then proposed in order to pave the way for common-mode voltage cancellation. The simulation results show the accuracy of exact common-mode model. In addition, the common-mode voltages can moderately cancel each other out, and the leakage current of the overall system is significantly attenuated."
"Carrier-Based Overmodulation Strategy for Matrix Converters  2018 IEEJ Industry Application Society.In this paper, carrier-based overmodulation for matrix converters is proposed. From the viewpoint of carrier-based modulation, there are two cases of overmodulation which correspond to (1) over output-voltage range and (2) over input-current range. Three simple strategies to limit the modulating functions under overmodulation are then studied. It is also clarified how the switching patterns and space vector utilization change in the overmodulation range. And the effects of the switching patterns and space-vector utilization on the current and voltage distortions are compared. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the error of fundamental amplitude between the output voltage and the desired output voltage is small with the so-called <2u1d>PWM, while using the max-input-phase as the reference in the carrier-based modulation gives low output voltage distortion."
"The role of intraoperative parameters on predicting laparoscopic abdominal surgery associated acute kidney injury  2018 The Author(s).Background: Laparoscopic abdominal surgery has been widely used to reduce the length of hospital stay and complications from open abdominal surgery. During the operation, the creation of pneumoperitoneum is used for better visualization of the operating field. However, the effect of pneumoperitoneum on kidney function is unknown. We aimed to identify risk factors and predictors associated with AKI development following laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Methods: A single-center prospective cohort study of laparoscopic abdominal surgery patients between June 2012 and December 2013. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (uNGAL) was measured on the first 3 days after surgery as a surrogate marker of AKI. Results: Of the 64 patients, 23 (35%) developed postoperative AKI. The mean age, initial blood pressure, and initial glomerular filtration rate were not different between AKI and non-AKI groups. Inflation time and exposure index were significantly higher in the AKI group compared to non-AKI group (192.0 vs 151.1 min, p = 0.045, and 2325.9 vs 1866.1 mmHg-minutes, p = 0.035). Operation time, mean intra-abdominal pressure, duration of intraoperative hypotension, amount of blood loss and intravenous fluid were not different between groups. In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, diabetes, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, and type of operation (urological surgery), exposure index was significantly associated with postoperative AKI, with odds ratio (95% CI) 1.47 (1.05-2.04), p = 0.024. By combining the intraoperative parameters with clinical model the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.71 (95% CI 0.58-0.84). Conclusions: AKI was a common condition in laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Exposure index has been proposed as a novel predictor of laparoscopic abdominal surgery associated AKI."
"Influence of A-site deficiency on electrical characteristics of barium strontium titanate perovskite dielectrics  2018 Author(s).Improvement of dielectric properties and insulation resistance are important for the development of high-performance dielectric materials. Various techniques can be used in order to improve the performance of such materials. The effect of A-cation deficiency on the electrical properties of barium strontium titanate ceramics is an interesting topic of investigation. Thus, this study examined the stoichiometric, 0.01 mol Ba-deficient, and 0.01 mol Sr-deficient compositions of (Ba0.8Sr0.2)TiO3 ceramics. Changes in the dielectric characteristics were observed in the 0.01 mol Ba-deficient and 0.01 mol Sr-deficient compositions. The characteristics of electrical conduction revealed by impedance analysis are different at high temperatures when Ba-deficiency and Sr-deficiency are introduced to the dielectrics. The Ti4+ state for the Ba-deficient composition is maintained. However, the Ti4+ state partially changes to the Ti3+ state, giving rise to the polaron hopping conduction process for Sr-deficient composition. Therefore, this study shows that a minor deviation of the A-cation from stoichiometry can induce a different conduction process while maintaining the dielectric permittivity characteristics."
"Controllable thermochromic and phase transition behaviors of polydiacetylene/zinc(II) ion/zinc oxide nanocomposites via photopolymerization: An insight into the molecular level  2018 Elsevier B.V.Reversible thermochromic polydiacetylene/zinc(II) ion/zinc oxide (PDA/Zn2+/ZnO) nanocomposites with a wide range of color-transition temperature have been prepared by varying photopolymerization time. This contribution presents our continuation study investigating into the molecular origins of this behavior. Infrared spectroscopy is utilized to investigate interfacial interactions of the systems while the conformation of PDA conjugated backbone is probed by Raman spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction explores molecular packing within the nanocomposites. We have found that the increase of photopolymerization time induces the relaxation of PDA backbone into a newly observed state indicated by systematic growth of new vibrational modes of C[tbnd]C and C[dbnd]C bonds. This relaxation process results in the decrease of reversible blue-to-purple color-transition temperature. In contrast, the increase of backbone length with photopolymerization time causes an opposite trend of the irreversible purple-to-red color transition observed at relatively high temperature region. Differential scanning calorimetry detects two distinct phase transitions corresponding to the melting of alkyl side chains and rigid backbone. These melting temperatures vary with photopolymerization time consistent with the variation of color-transition temperature."
"Toward real-time data query systems in HEP  2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Exploratory data analysis tools must respond quickly to a user's questions, so that the answer to one question (e.g. a visualized histogram or fit) can influence the next. In some SQL-based query systems used in industry, even very large (petabyte) datasets can be summarized on a human timescale (seconds), employing techniques such as columnar data representation, caching, indexing, and code generation/JIT-compilation. This article describes progress toward realizing such a system for High Energy Physics (HEP), focusing on the intermediate problems of optimizing data access and calculations for ""query sized"" payloads, such as a single histogram or group of histograms, rather than large reconstruction or data-skimming jobs. These techniques include direct extraction of ROOT TBranches into Numpy arrays and compilation of Python analysis functions (rather than SQL) to be executed very quickly. We will also discuss the problem of caching and actively delivering jobs to worker nodes that have the necessary input data preloaded in cache. All of these pieces of the larger solution are available as standalone GitHub repositories, and could be used in current analyses."
"Prokinetics for functional dyspepsia  2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.Background: Dyspepsia is a common condition associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Prokinetics are the treatment of choice for functional dyspepsia (FD). However, the role of prokinetics in FD treatment is still controversial. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of prokinetics in the treatment of FD. The primary outcome was overall absence of or improvement of symptoms and symptom scores at the end of treatment. We also evaluated quality of life (QoL) and adverse events as secondary outcomes. Search methods: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL, from 1946 until September 2017. RevMan 5.3 was used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) of symptoms persisting or without improved QoL or adverse events, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) of post-treatment symptoms scores, changes of symptom scores, and QoL, when appropriate with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using a random-effects model. Quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE methodology. Selection criteria: We included studies that were parallel group RCTs comparing one prokinetic with either placebo or another prokinetic of the same or different class for the treatment of FD. Studies involved adults who presented with dyspepsia symptoms and who had negative or insignificant findings on endoscopy as well as no other organic and metabolic disorders. Studies only including participants with primarily reflux or heartburn symptoms were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, study quality and performed data extraction. Main results: From an initial 1388 citations, we identified 43 studies in 40 papers. Of those, 29 studies with 10,044 participants compared six prokinetics with placebo for the outcome of absence of symptoms or symptom improvement. There was a statistically significant effect of prokinetic treatment in reducing global symptoms of FD (RR of remaining dyspeptic = 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.89; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) =7, very low-quality evidence) with considerable heterogeneity; I2 = 91% (P < 0.00001). After removing cisapride from the analysis, the effect of prokinetics in global symptom improvement still persisted, compared to placebo (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94), but was still based on very low-quality evidence. The result showed persistence of significant improvement in subgroups of studies at unclear or at low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.92), and in subgroups by molecules of cisapride (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.93; NNTB = 4), acotiamide (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98; NNTB = 20) and tegaserod(RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96; NNTB = 14). Ten studies compared different types of prokinetics with each other and the most commonly used comparator was domperidone, 10 mg three times a day (eight of the 10 studies). There was a significantly better post-treatment symptom score in other prokinetics, compared to domperidone (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.03, very low-quality evidence), but no difference in reducing global symptom (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07), and mean difference symptom scores (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.05). We found five studies that assessed quality of life, but there was no benefit in improving quality of life with prokinetic treatment (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.33; participants = 1774). The adverse events in individual prokinetics was not different from placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.25; participants = 3811; studies = 17). However, when we looked at the adverse effects by each prokinetic, there were overall greater adverse effects in the active treatment group with cisapride (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.65; P = 0.03). The most common side effects were diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort and nausea. The funnel plot was asymmetric (Egger's test, P = 0.02) implying reporting bias or other small-study effects may be, in part, driving the benefit of prokinetics compared to placebo in this meta-analysis. The GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence in each outcome are mostly low or very low due to concerns around risk of bias in study design, unexplained heterogeneity and possible publication bias. Authors' conclusions: Due to low, or very low, quality of evidence, we are unable to say whether prokinetics are effective for the treatment of functional dyspepsia . We are uncertain which of the individual prokinetic drugs is the most effective as well as whether prokinetics can improve quality of life. Apart from cisapride, prokinetics are well-tolerated. Good quality RCTs are needed to verify the efficacy of prokinetics."
"Facile Electrodeposition of Ni-Cu-P Dendrite Nanotube Films with Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Activity and Durability  2018 American Chemical Society. Hydrogen can be the potential substitute energy carrier for fuel while electrolysis water with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an efficient way to produce hydrogen. Highly active and robust electrocatalysts composed by earth abundant elements are required. Herein, nickel-copper-phosphorus (Ni-Cu-P) electrocatalysts are designed and synthesized by a facile one-step electrodeposition method. A unique pine-needle-like dendrite nanotube morphology of Ni-Cu-P electrocatalyst can be synthesized when copper content changed and impressive HER activity obtained in alkaline and acidic media. Briefly, the overpotential reaches 120 mV in 1 M KOH and 150 mV in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 at the current density of 10 mA cm -2 , with the corresponding Tafel slope reaching 69 mV dec -1 . The results are close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts (37 mV in 1 M KOH). Furthermore, the density functional theory calculations also demonstrate that P-incorporated Ni-Cu, Cu-incorporated Ni-P, and Ni-incorporated Cu-P have the optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG H∗ ) of -0.066, -0.157, and -0.003 eV, respectively, which are more suitable than those of Ni-Cu, Ni-P, and Cu-P, respectively. The Ni-incorporated Cu-P even has a much smaller ΔG H∗ of -0.003 than that of Pt (∼-0.09 eV). We believe that our study will provide a new strategy to design non-noble metal alloy materials for practical applications in catalysis and energy fields."
"Acanthus ebracteatus leaf extract provides neuronal cell protection against oxidative stress injury induced by glutamate 06 Biological Sciences 0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology  2018 The Author(s).Background: Acanthus ebracteatus (AE), an herb native to Asia, has been recognized in traditional folk medicine not only for its antioxidant properties and various pharmacological activities but also as an ingredient of longevity formulas. However, its anti-neurodegenerative potential is not yet clearly known. This work aimed to evaluate the protective effect of AE leaf extract against glutamate-induced oxidative damage in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells, a neurodegenerative model system due to a reduction in glutathione levels and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Methods: Cell viability, apoptosis, and ROS assays were performed to assess the protective effect of AE leaf extract against glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells. The antioxidant capacity of AE was evaluated using in vitro radical scavenging assays. The subcellular localization of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and the mRNA and protein levels of genes associated with the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant system were determined to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of AE leaf extract. Results: We demonstrated that AE leaf extract is capable of attenuating the intracellular ROS generation and HT22 cell death induced by glutamate in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-treatment of glutamate with the extract significantly reduced apoptotic cell death via inhibition of AIF nuclear translocation. The increases in Nrf2 levels in the nucleus and gene expression levels of antioxidant-related downstream genes under Nrf2 control were found to be significant in cells treated with the extract. Conclusions: The results suggested that AE leaf extract possesses neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced oxidative injury and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress."
"Supersymmetric solutions of matter-coupled 7D N=2 gauged supergravity  2018 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.We study supersymmetric solutions within seven-dimensional N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets in seven dimensions. The gauged supergravity contains six vector fields that gauge the SO(4)∼SO(3)×SO(3) symmetry and admits two N=2 supersymmetric AdS7 vacua with SO(4) and SO(3)diagSO(3)×SO(3) symmetries. We consider solutions interpolating between two asymptotically locally AdS7 geometries in the presence of a three-form field. For a particular value of the two SO(3) gauge coupling constants, the SO(3)diag supersymmetric AdS7 vacuum does not exist, but the solutions can be uplifted to 11 dimensions by a known reduction ansatz. We also study solutions of this type and their embedding in M theory. We further extend these solutions to include the SO(3)diag gauge fields and argue that, in general, this generalization does not lead to supersymmetric solutions."
"Exponential metric represents a traversable wormhole  2018 American Physical Society.For various reasons, a number of authors have mooted an ""exponential form"" for the spacetime metric ds2=-e-2m/rdt2+e+2m/r{dr2+r2(dθ2+sin2θdφ2)}.While the weak-field behavior matches nicely with weak-field general relativity, and so also automatically matches nicely with the Newtonian gravity limit, the strong-field behavior is markedly different. Proponents of these exponential metrics have very much focused on the absence of horizons - it is certainly clear that this geometry does not represent a black hole. However, the proponents of these exponential metrics have failed to note that instead one is dealing with a traversable wormhole - with all of the interesting and potentially problematic features that such an observation raises. If one wishes to replace all the black hole candidates astronomers have identified with traversable wormholes, then certainly a careful phenomenological analysis of this quite radical proposal should be carried out."
"Optimizing the liquidity parameter of logarithmic market scoring rules prediction markets  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Prediction markets are techniques to aggregate dispersed public opinions via market mechanisms to predict uncertain future events’ outcome. Many experiments have shown that prediction markets outperform other traditional forecasting methods in terms of accuracy. Logarithmic market scoring rules (LMSR) is one of the most simple and widely used market mechanisms; however, market makers have to confront crucial design decisions including the setting of the parameter “b” or the “liquidity parameter” in the price functions. As the liquidity parameter has significant effects on the market performance, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive basis for the setting of the parameter. Design/methodology/approach: The analyses include the effects of the liquidity parameter on the forecast standard error and the amount of time for the market price to converge to the true value. These experiments use artificial prediction markets, the proposed simulation models that mimic real prediction markets. Findings: The simulation results indicate that prediction market’s forecast standard error decreases as the value of the liquidity parameter increases. Moreover, for any given number of traders in the market, there exists an optimal liquidity parameter value that yields appropriate price adaptability and leads to the fastest price convergence. Originality/value: Understanding these tradeoffs, the market makers can effectively determine the liquidity parameter value under various objectives on the standard error, the time to convergence and cost."
"Thai silk fibroin gelation process enhancing by monohydric and polyhydric alcohols  2018 Elsevier B.V.Silk fibroin hydrogel is an interesting natural material in various biomedical applications. However, the self-assembled gelation takes a long time. In this work, different alcohol types are used as gelation enhancers for aqueous silk fibroin solution. Monohydric alcohols having carbon chain length from C1 to C4 and polyhydric alcohols with the number of mono- to tri- hydroxyl groups were used as the enhancers which are effective for rapid gelation. The addition of monohydric alcohol distinctively reduced the gelation time, comparing to the polyhydric alcohol. The gelation process is directly dependent on the polarity of alcohol and hydrophobicity. The alcohol mediated gelation imparts strong viscoelastic property and enhanced compressive modulus of resulting hydrogels. This is due to the effective formation of self-assembled beta sheet network of the silk fibroin chains facilitates the gelation process."
"Influence of carrageenan molecular structures on electromechanical behaviours of poly(3-hexylthiophene)/carrageenan conductive hydrogels  2018The κ ι and λ carrageenans were fabricated by solution casting as soft and electrically responsive actuators. The poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was added as a dispersed phase to improve the electrical and electromechanical properties of the pristine carrageenan hydrogels. The electromechanical properties of the carrageenan hydrogels were investigated under the effects of electric field strength, carrageenan type namely κ ι and λ operating temperature, and P3HT concentration. The electromechanical responses of the pristine carrageenans increased with increasing sulfated groups present; the λ-carragenan hydrogel provided the highest storage modulus sensitivity of 4.0 under applied electric field strength of 800 V/mm. With increasing temperature, the double-helical structure of the κ-carrageenan hydrogel changed into a random coil leading to the increase in the storage modulus response. On the other hand, the P3HT/κ-carrageenan hydrogel blend at 0.10%v/v P3HT provided the high storage modulus sensitivity of 2.20 at the electric field strength of 800 V/mm. The higher dielectrophoretic forces were due to the additional P3HT electronic polarization, but lower deflections relative to those of the pristine κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Both κ- and λ-carrageenans with the double helical structures are shown here as possible candidates to be fabricated as electroactive hydrogels for actuator or biomedical applications."
"Facile and green synthesis of pullulan derivative-stabilized Au nanoparticles as drug carriers for enhancing anticancer activity  2018 Elsevier LtdIn this work, we report for the first time AuNPs reduced/stabilized/capped with modified para-aminobenzoic acid-quat188-pullulan (PABA-QP) as excellent nanocarriers for delivery of doxorubicin to enhance the activity and safety of these systems. Spherical AuNPs@PABA-QP obtained by facile and green synthesis under optimum conditions were characterized by UV-VIS, TEM, EDS, SAED, XRD, ATR-FTIR and zeta-potential analyses and showed a narrow size distribution of 13.7 ± 1.9 nm. DOX was successfully loaded onto AuNPs@PABA-QP via intermolecular interactions with high drug loading. DOX-AuNPs@PABA-QP (IC50 = 0.39μM) showed a 2.1-fold higher cytotoxicity against Chago cells than DOX alone (IC50 = 0.82μM), while exhibiting less cytotoxicity against normal cells (Wi-38). Moreover, DOX-AuNPs@PABA-QP also demonstrated high intracellular uptake by endocytosis, arrested in S and G2-M phases of the cell cycle (total S/G2-M increased to approximately 18.0%), induced excellent cytotoxicity, and increased the fraction of late-apoptotic cells (18.6%). Consequently, it is suggested that the novel combination of DOX-AuNPs@PABA-QP has the potential to be developed for human cancer treatment."
"Comparison of zinc, lead, cadmium, cobalt, manganese, iron, chromium and copper in duck eggs from three duck farm systems in Central and Western, Thailand  2018 Elsevier Inc.This was a comparative study of the heavy metal levels (Zn, Pb, Cd, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr and Cu) in eggs from free grazing duck, small-scale, and large-scale farms in central and western regions of Thailand. A questionnaire was used to gather demographic data for the analysis of heavy metal contamination in feed, drinking water and wastewater. The correlation between the amounts of heavy metal contamination in eggs was studied against the heavy metals found in feed, drinking water and wastewater. The levels of Pb, Cd, Cr and Cu in eggs from large-scale farms were significantly higher than small farms and free grazing farms at P < 0.001. Zn in eggs from free grazing farms was higher than in the small farms and large-scale farms sampled. The contamination of Pb in eggs from all types of farms exceeded the standard limits of ACFS 6703–2005. The average levels of Pb in the eggs from small-scale farms correlated significantly with the level of Pb found in the feed at P < 0.05, while the average levels of Pb in eggs from free grazing duck farms correlated significantly with the levels of Pb found in the drinking water at P < 0.05. Additionally, the average level of Cu in duck egg from large-scale farms correlated significantly with the level of Cu found in the feeds at P < 0.001. Furthermore, from a calculation of the provisional tolerable daily intake (WHO-FAO) of heavy metals in this study, it was concluded that consumers face health risks from Cd contamination. Thus, heavy metal contamination, especially Pb and Cd in duck egg, must be of concern due to the health risks and the route of crucial heavy metals contamination should be elucidated and long - term monitoring of heavy metals posing health effects in farm systems should be carried out."
"The Impact of Tobacco Consumption on Rural Household Expenditure and Self-rated Health Among Rural Household Members in China  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Objectives: To estimate how tobacco consumption affects household expenditure on other goods and services in rural China and to assess the tobacco consumption affects self-rated health among rural household members in China. Methods: A Seemingly Unrelated Regression was used to assess the impact of tobacco consumption on rural household expenditure. To detect tobacco consumption causing heterogeneity in self-rated health among adults in rural China, this study employed a random effects generalized ordered probit model. 2010–2014 China Family Panel Studies was used for the analysis. The data set included 3,611 households and 10,610 adults in each wave. Results: Tobacco consumption households assign significantly lower budget shares to food, health care, dress, and education in rural China. Moreover, self-rated health factor has a significantly positive coefficient with respect to non-smokers and ex-smokers, that is, when the individuals is a non-smoker or ex-smoker, he/ she will be more likely to report his/her health status as positive. Conclusions: The first analysis showed that tobacco consumption crowds out expenditures on food, dress, health care, and education for rural households in China, and the second analysis indicated that non-smokers and ex-smokers are more likely to report their health status as better compared with last year. The results of the present study revealed that Chinese policymakers might consider controlling tobacco consumption since tobacco control can improve not only rural household welfare but also rural household members' health status. Therefore, the tobacco tax policy and brief clinical interventions by the doctor should be implemented in rural China."
"The improvement of calvarial bone healing by durable nanogel-crosslinked materials  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Different approaches have been developed to improve the scaffold properties that provide structural support and biological interaction to achieve the desired environment for tissue regeneration. We previously reported that addition of human fibroblast growth factor 18 (hFGF18) to acryloyl group-modified cholesterol-bearing pullulan (CHPOA) nanogel-crosslinked (NanoClik) hydrogels that contain human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (hBMP2) stabilized bone healing in mouse calvarial defect model. In this study, we evaluated the use of disc-shaped dried nanogel-crosslinked gel as carriers of growth factors in order to seek possible clinical application in future. Both conventionally-dried NanoClik disc and nanogel-crosslinked porous (NanoCliP) disc made by freeze-drying that contained the growth factors induced bone healing but not as much as with NanoClik hydrogel application but addition of RGD peptides (RGD-NanoCliP disc) improved the healing. All type of discs showed the same biphasic ovalbumin-Alexa Fluor 488 protein release profile in vitro, an initial burst followed by a gradual sustained release more than one week, which was confirmed in vivo. Histological analysis showed remarkable new bone formation with more calcification in RGD-NanoCliP disc with the growth factors and the osteogenesis appeared to begin in the dura mater in contact with the disc. These observations suggest: (1) the fitness of the durable discs to the bone defect is a critical factor for bone healing, which is supplemented by addition of RGD peptides, (2) the porosity is suitable for osteoblast recruitment, (3) growth factor release pattern of the CHPOA nanogel based gels is ideal for bone healing."
"Theoretical investigation of thiophene-linked porphyrin-perylene photosensitiser for bulk-heterojunction solar cells  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.In this work, quantum chemical calculations were applied to investigate a new series of porphyrin-perylene conjugates for their potential use as light-harvesting compounds in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Molecular design relies on the integration of a electron-donating porphyrin and a electron-accepting perylene units via a spacer containing 0 to 10 thiophene rings. Electronic properties of these push–pull systems were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT approaches. Results show that introduction of thiophene-based spacer with different number of the thiophene rings significantly affects the electronic and absorption properties of the molecules. According to its suitable energy gap, efficient charge transfer and appropriate absorption behaviour determined by the calculation, the derivative having a terthiophene linker should be as the optimal compound among all molecules studied herein."
"Copper oxide nanoparticles cause a dose-dependent toxicity via inducing reactive oxygen species in drosophila  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) have attracted considerable attention, because of their biocide potential and capability for optical imaging, however CuONPs were shown to be highly toxic in various experimental model systems. In this study, mechanism underlying CuONP-induced toxicity was investigated using Drosophila as an in vivo model. Upon oral route of administration, CuONPs accumulated in the body, and caused a dose-dependent decrease in egg-to-adult survivorship and a delay in development. In particular, transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed CuONPs were detected inside the intestinal epithelial cells and lumen. A drastic increase in apoptosis and reactive oxygen species was also observed in the gut exposed to CuONPs. Importantly, we found that inhibition of the transcription factor Nrf2 further enhances the toxicity caused by CuONPs. These observations suggest that CuONPs disrupt the gut homeostasis and that oxidative stress serves as one of the primary causes of CuONP-induced toxicity in Drosophila."
"Potential use of plastic wastes for low thermal conductivity concrete  2018 by the authors.The use of plastics has increased over the years, thus resulting in a large volume of plastic waste being generated and accumulated in the environment. Due to its non-biodegradability and persistence, recycling processes have become one of the sustainable solutions for preventing environmental deterioration. Plastic wastes, including high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were collected from industrial sector and used as additional ingredients to improve concrete properties. Prior to concrete processing, an increase in wettability of plastic fibers using nonionic surfactant, Dehydol LS-12, was investigated. At the optimal concentration of 10 times of the critical micelle concentration (CMC), an interfacial tension and a contact angle were reduced to 31-32 mN/m and 65°-68°, respectively. Properties of concrete were determined and compared to those of the mortar samples. Porosity was found to increase with higher volume fraction of plastic fibers, whereas decreases in workability, bulk density, thermal conductivity, splitting tensile strength, and compressive strength were encountered. The lowest thermal conductivity was recorded for concrete samples prepared with 30% by volume of LDPE fibers, and the rest in descending order were HDPE, PP, and PET, respectively. Furthermore, the maximal inclusions of plastic fibers were 5% for HDPE and LDPE, 10% for PP, and 50% for PET so as to satisfy the precast concrete wall requirements."
"Search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalars in the final state with two b quarks and two τ leptons in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The Author(s)A search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons is performed for the first time in the final state with two b quarks and two τ leptons. The search is motivated in the context of models of physics beyond the standard model (SM), such as two Higgs doublet models extended with a complex scalar singlet (2HDM + S), which include the next-to-minimal supersymmetric SM (NMSSM). The results are based on a data set of proton–proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1, accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV. Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 15 and 60GeV are probed, and no excess of events above the SM expectation is observed. Upper limits between 3 and 12% are set on the branching fraction B(h→aa→2τ2b) assuming the SM production of the Higgs boson. Upper limits are also set on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to two light pseudoscalar bosons in different 2HDM + S scenarios. Assuming the SM production cross section for the Higgs boson, the upper limit on this quantity is as low as 20% for a mass of the pseudoscalar of 40GeV in the NMSSM."
"General couplings of a vector multiplet in N = 1 supergravity with new FI terms  2018 The AuthorsWe propose new interactions of a (massive) vector multiplet with chiral multiplets and (D-type) spontaneously broken supersymmetry in four-dimensional N=1 supergravity, due to the generalized Fayet–Iliopoulos (FI) terms. Our actions are invariant under linearly realized off-shell supersymmetry and Kähler–Weyl transformations. We compute the scalar potentials and pinpoint some physical restrictions arising in this approach."
"Study of jet quenching with isolated-photon+jet correlations in PbPb and pp collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV  2018 The AuthorMeasurements of azimuthal angle and transverse momentum (pT) correlations of isolated photons and associated jets are reported for pp and PbPb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV. The data were recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. For events containing a leading isolated photon with pT γ>40 GeV/c and an associated jet with pT jet>30 GeV/c, the photon+jet azimuthal correlation and pT imbalance in PbPb collisions are studied as functions of collision centrality and pT γ. The results are compared to pp reference data collected at the same collision energy and to predictions from several theoretical models for parton energy loss. No evidence of broadening of the photon+jet azimuthal correlations is observed, while the ratio pT jet/pT γ decreases significantly for PbPb data relative to the pp reference. All models considered agree within uncertainties with the data. The number of associated jets per photon with pT γ>80 GeV/c is observed to be shifted towards lower pT jet values in central PbPb collisions compared to pp collisions."
"Cytoplasmic p21 mediates 5-fluorouracil resistance by inhibiting pro-apoptotic Chk2  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The oncogenic cytoplasmic p21 contributes to cancer aggressiveness and chemotherapeutic failure. However, the molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we show for the first time that cytoplasmic p21 mediates 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) resistance by shuttling p-Chk2 out of the nucleus to protect the tumor cells from its pro-apoptotic functions. We observed that cytoplasmic p21 levels were up-regulated in 5FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells in vitro and the in vivo Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Kinase array analysis revealed that p-Chk2 is a key target of cytoplasmic p21. Importantly, cytoplasmic form of p21 mediated by p21T145D transfection diminished p-Chk2-mediated activation of E2F1 and apoptosis induction. Co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and proximity ligation assay showed that p21 forms a complex with p-Chk2 under 5FU exposure. Using in silico computer modeling, we suggest that the p21/p-Chk2 interaction hindered the nuclear localization signal of p-Chk2, and therefore, the complex is exported out of the nucleus. These findings unravel a novel mechanism regarding an oncogenic role of p21 in regulation of resistance to 5FU-based chemotherapy. We suggest a possible value of cytoplasmic p21 as a prognosis marker and a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer patients."
"An alternative method for dried papaya production  2018 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.In dried fruit processing, osmotic dehydration is normally applied as a preliminary process before drying. However, it has some drawbacks of time consumption and the amount of solution used. This study was aimed to introduce an alternative osmotic dehydration for osmosed air-dried papaya production and to determine the obtained product quality. The control papaya sample was firstly cut transversely and then cut into slices before being covered with sucrose granule, at 120% of the weight of papaya for 2 h, then increased to 180% for another 2 h. After excess sugar removal, the osmosed papaya slices were dried in a hot-air dryer at 60°C until moisture content reached 21%. A comparative study using a mix of sucrose-sorbitol (Su-Sor) by partial replacement of sucrose with 10% sorbitol was performed. The Su-Sor treatment showed higher water loss and solid gain during osmosis and the finished product after hot-air drying presented lower water activity compared to the control. Product texture (hardness) of the Su-Sor treatment was also softer. However, sample shrinkage from both treatments was similar (about 54%). Microstructure analysis of osmosed papaya and osmosed air-dried papaya under scanning electron microscope revealed that there were differences in cell structure of the sample treated with different types of sugar used during osmosis. Moreover, more cell collapse was observed under alternative treatment."
"Factors affecting anthocyanin stability and antioxidant activity of Ma-kiang (Cleistocalyx nervosum var. Paniala) juice  2018 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.Ma-kiang is a native plant of the northern parts of Thailand. The ripe fruit is edible, is purplish in colour and contains high levels of anthocyanins, natural compounds known for their antioxidant activity. Ma-kiang fruit is usually consumed as fruit juice. The common thermal processes could be employed to help preserve the fruit, but unfortunately anthocyanins exhibit low stability, particularly during heating and storage. This research aims to study the effect of extraction methods, heating process and storage conditions on anthocyanin stability and the antioxidant activity of Ma-kiang juice. The methods used to extract anthocyanins were hydraulic press and solvent extraction (ethanol: 0, 20, 40, 50, 60 and 80%). The juices were heated at 100°C for 15 min and then studied during storage conditions of 0, 4 and 25°C for five weeks. The total polyphenol and the monomeric anthocyanin (MA) content varied from 504.68 to 1847.35 µg GAE g-1 extract and 94.85 to 385.74 mg L-1, respectively. The heating process significantly decreased the amount of anthocyanins in Ma-kiang juices (p≤0.05). In contrast, the storage condition at a temperature of 4°C minimally affected the stability of MA and the antioxidant activity (t½, MA = 47.65 weeks). In contrast, storage at 0 and 25°C decreased the anthocyanin stability and the antioxidant activity of Ma-kiang juice dramatically (p≤0.05). From this research, the optimal practical method to extract Ma-kiang juice is ethanol 40% extraction and minimal thermal treatment for sterilisation. Moreover, the juice should be kept at 4°C to maintain stability of anthocyanins and preserve the health benefits in Ma-kiang juice."
"Change of Citrus medica L. Var. Linetta volatile profile after three months storage  2018 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.Citrus medica L. var. linetta is commonly known as citron or Somsa in Thailand. It is a local fruit that can be grown in most parts of Thailand. Leaf and peel provide unique aroma oil. The taste of the juice is sour and sweet and it is used as a seasoning in Thai cuisine. In addition, Somsa is believed to have a medicinal effect on sore throat, cough and sputum. In contrast to its wide range of applications, Somsa is not commonly utilised due to limited availability, which has resulted in few studies of Somsa. The objective of this study is to identify the volatile compounds in fresh Somsa and Somsa stored for three months at 30°C. The information obtained could emphasise the importance of this plant and enhance usage options. The method of analysis was solid phase micro extraction (SPME). Volatile constituents were extracted from 1.5 g samples each of exocarp, mesocarp, endocarp, vesicle and seed with headspace of 4.5, 4.5, 2.5, 3 and 5 cm, respectively, in amber jar volume 31.4 cm3. The sample was placed in water bath at 70°C for 30 min to reach equilibrium. Absorption period was compared at 20 and 40 min. The volatile was injected into gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The results showed that the different absorption time did not affect percentage of peak area. Volatile profiles of five different parts of Somsa were similar. Main components in fresh and stored Somsa were D-limonene (4.63-39.85%), naphthalene (1.07-9.45%) and 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol (2.45-9.52%). Stored Somsa had overall lower concentrations compared to fresh. In addition, new volatile compounds were found in the stored sample including 9-octadecenoic acid and acetic acid. This indicated there was the formation of acid compounds during storage. Therefore, storage of Somsa at elevated temperature increases acidity through acid compounds generation and reduction of volatile concentration."
"Bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity in commercial mao juice products in Thailand  2018 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.Mao, belonging to genus Antidesma, has urged more attention in Thailand as antioxidant-rich berries in this past decade. Its juice is extendedly available in the market throughout Thailand with the advertisement of being high in nutrition and antioxidant values. While these selling points are based primarily on scientific research on functional properties of bioactive compounds in fresh mao berries, the value of antioxidant level in commercial mao juice had not yet been reported. It is therefore in our interest to examine actual amount of antioxidants in the commercial juice products. This study selected four brands of ready-to-drink mao juice frequently found in the market and determined their total anthocyanins, total phenolics and antioxidant activities by FRAP and ORAC assay. Freshly pressed juice was evaluated as a benchmark. Effect of heat treatment, commonly used by manufacturers, was also investigated by heating freshly pressed juice at 80°C for 15 min before hot-filled in a glass bottle. The results showed that freshly pressed juice had a total of anthocyanins of 1,344.27 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside eq L-1, phenolics of 3,346.80 GAE L-1, FRAP of 40,142.86 µmol TE L-1 and ORAC of 60,949.0 µmol TE L-1. After heat treatment, these values were remained at 50.08, 63.01, 61.86 and 86.25%, respectively, of fresh juice. It was also found that these respective values from commercial juice were only 1.59-2.84, 12.46-21.75, 7.59-19.34 and 7.93-20.17% of the fresh juice. The substantial lower amount of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of commercial ready-to-drink mao juices could resulted, not only from heat treatment process, but also from additional processing steps, product formulation and especially storage. The perception of consumers on functional properties of commercial mao juice was discussed in this paper."
"Effect of citric acid concentrations, storage time and temperature, and steaming on antioxidant activities of Siam tulip (Curcuma alismatifolia Gagnep) flower  2018 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.Siam tulip (Curcuma alismatifolia Gagnep) flowers are commonly consumed as a vegetable in many Thai dishes especially steamed flower as a side-dish for Thai dipping sauce. They have to be cooked within few days after harvesting due to dramatically physical changes. Investigation in order to prolong the shelf-life of Siam tulip flowers using citric acid was performed and antioxidant activities were evaluated. The stem of flowers was cut and covered with wet cotton wool soaking in citric acid solution with concentrations of 200, 400, 600 and 800 ppm. The one covered with cotton wool soaking in distilled water was set as the control. They were then wrapped with aluminium foil to prevent the solution evaporation. The untreated flower was set as the reference. Flowers were stored at room temperature (30°C) and in a refrigerator (4°C) for 7 days. The samples were determined for moisture content, total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activities every day for a period of 7 days. For all treatments, TPC, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of Siam tulip flowers were decreasing along the storage time. Based on the above three parameters, citric acid at 600 ppm was the best choice to maintain antioxidant activities but not different from the use of 800 ppm citric acid (P>0.05). Compared to room temperature storage, storage at 4°C could retard a decrease in antioxidant activities. After steaming for 10 min, TPC and DPPH radical scavenging activity of Siam tulip flowers stored at both conditions increased about 10% while FRAP increased about 8%."

Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the »https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/» Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI.This Letter presents the results of a search for pair-produced particles of masses above 100 GeV that each decay into at least four quarks. Using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2015-2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38.2 fb-1, reconstructed particles are clustered into two large jets of similar mass, each consistent with four-parton substructure. No statistically significant excess of data over the background prediction is observed in the distribution of average jet mass. Pair-produced squarks with dominant hadronic R-parity-violating decays into four quarks and with masses between 0.10 and 0.72 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Similarly, pair-produced gluinos that decay into five quarks are also excluded with masses between 0.10 and 1.41 TeV at 95% confidence level. These are the first constraints that have been placed on pair-produced particles with masses below 400 GeV that decay into four or five quarks, bridging a significant gap in the coverage of R-parity-violating supersymmetry parameter space."
"Morphological and molecular evidence reveal a new species of the earthworm genus Pontodrilus Perrier, 1874 (Clitellata, Megascolecidae) from Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia Copyright  2018 Magnolia Press.A new species of the megascolecid earthworm genus Pontodrilus Perrier, 1874, Pontodrilus longissimus sp. n., is described from seashores of Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia. The new species differs from congeners, especially the cosmopolitan P. litoralis (Grube, 1855) in the size of the body, number of segments and the shape of the spermathecae. P. litoralis is redescribed, based on specimens collected from the same region and the same type of habitat. DNA fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I of both species were sequenced. Morphological as well as DNA sequence-based comparisons confirm that P. longissimus sp. n. is a lineage distinct from P. litoralis and in fact a new species. The illustrated descriptions are accompanied by a key to species of Pontodrilus."
"Pseudorapidity and transverse momentum dependence of flow harmonics in p Pb and PbPb collisions  2018 CERN. for the CMS Collaboration. Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.Measurements of azimuthal angular correlations are presented for high-multiplicity pPb collisions at sNN=5.02TeV and peripheral PbPb collisions at sNN=2.76TeV. The data used in this work were collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Fourier coefficients as functions of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity are studied using the scalar product method; four-, six-, and eight-particle cumulants; and the Lee-Yang zero technique. The influence of event plane decorrelation is evaluated using the scalar product method and found to account for most of the observed pseudorapidity dependence."
"Microwave-Enhanced On-Water Amination of 2-Mercaptobenzoxazoles to Prepare 2-Aminobenzoxazoles  2018 American Chemical Society.In this work, we developed a catalyst-free amination of 2-mercaptobenzoxazoles on water under microwave irradiation. The product, 2-aminobenzoxazoles, was successfully produced via direct amination with various amines in moderate to high yields. The formal synthesis of Suvorexant, a medication for the treatment of insomnia, was accomplished using a developed amination process. The reaction was completed in an hour at 100-150 °C in a microwave reactor without the use of external catalyst or additive. Key benefits of this process include an on-water reaction, short reaction time, being scalable and catalyst-free, and use of 2-mercaptobenzoxazoles as an inexpensive starting material having low environmental impact in its preparation."
"Data-driven roadmapping turning challenges into opportunities  2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc. (PICMET).A number of organizations are struggling with roadmap implementation. While some companies implement it successfully, many cannot effectively apply the roadmap to their strategic operations. Keeping an up-to-date roadmap to reflect changes in the business environment is considered a major challenge in the field. The main focus of this explorative study extends the understanding of roadmap implementation and addresses the opportunities and challenges for future research by illustrating four case studies from both the private and public sectors. Semi-structured interviews with top management were conducted to obtain common critical components. The findings from this study highlight and confirm the major challenges involved in keeping the roadmapping process alive, as represented in previous studies. The results of case studies reflect the challenges and opportunities with integrating big data and transforming existing processes into data-driven roadmapping. This paper proposes a conceptual design for a system to help keep the roadmap alive- A ccurately reflecting current economic and business conditions, based on insights constantly obtained from various streams of information sources. Comprehensive analyses of existing data could help to detect the ongoing changes and indicate economic, social, and technological tendencies. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, time series, and text mining are suggested techniques for providing useful insight and substantial information from the multitude of data. This approach can be integrated into the decision support system, based on an algorithmic, semi-automatic evaluation of roadmap status."
"Observation of the Z →ψ + - Decay in pp Collisions at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.This Letter presents the observation of the rare Z boson decay Z→ψ + -. Here, ψ represents contributions from direct J/ψ and ψ(2S)→J/ψX, + - is a pair of electrons or muons, and the J/ψ meson is detected via its decay to μ+μ-. The sample of proton-proton collision data, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The signal is observed with a significance in excess of 5 standard deviations. After subtraction of the ψ(2S)→J/ψX contribution, the ratio of the branching fraction of the exclusive decay Z→J/ψ + - to the decay Z→μ+μ-μ+μ- within a fiducial phase space is measured to be B(Z→J/ψ + -)/B(Z→μ+μ-μ+μ-)=0.67±0.18(stat)±0.05(syst)."
"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I and II seroprevalence among volunteer blood donors in Thailand  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I and II (HTLV-I/II) are closely related but distinct retroviruses that can infect humans. Both the viruses can be transmitted via transfusion of contaminated blood components. HTLV pre-transfusion screening is not mandatory in Thailand until now. Current epidemiological data for HTLV prevalence is still lacking since the past surveys were done more than a decade ago. The main objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of HTLV-I/II among voluntary blood donors in Thailand. 11,057 volunteer blood donors were screened for HTLV-I/II antibodies using the ARCHITECT rHTLV-I/II chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). Initial-reactive (IR) samples were subjected to repeat duplicate testing and were also sent for confirmatory testing at Korean Red Cross Society (KRC), Seoul or National Serology Reference Laboratories (NRL), Australia using alternate HTLV serological assays and immunoblot and/or specific nucleic acid testing respectively. Out of 11,057 plasma samples, 10,080 were low-risk seronegative donors and 977 were first-time/high-risk donors. Twenty of 24 IR samples were repeatedly reactive (RR) in low-risk seronegative donors group. On confirmatory testing of these 24 IR by immunoblot, 13 indeterminate and 11 negative results were observed. One out of 977 samples from first-time/high-risk donors was RR for anti-HTLV-I/II antibodies. This sample was co-reactive for HBsAg, but negative for HTLV by EIA or in-house HTLV-I qPCR. The ARCHITECT rHTLV-I/II assay exhibited a specificity of 99.93% in low-risk donors and 99.90% among high-risk donors. This study concluded that HTLV-I/II prevalence is low among blood donors in Thailand. But periodic surveillance should be continually conducted to ensure high blood safety standards in the country."
"Amphotericin B-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carrier (NLCs): effect of drug loading and biopharmaceutical characterizations  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The aim of this study was to further investigate the effect of drug loading, drug entrapment efficiency, the drug release profiles and biopharmaceutical point of views of amphotericin B (AmB) lipid formulations, that is, degree of aggregation by UV-spectroscopy, in vitro hemolytic and antifungal activities. The optimum drug loading was 2.5% by weight corresponded to lipid fraction in formulation. Increasing of the drug entrapment was achieved by blending small amount of phospholipid in solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) dispersions. All AmB lipid dispersions were less aggregated species and hemolytic response than Fungizone® indicating that lipid nanoparticles could reduce its toxicity. The sustained release profiles of AmB formulations depended on its aggregated form and entrapment efficiency. Too high AmB loaded (5% w/w) showed a biphasic drug release profile probably due to some amounts of drug deposited on the nanosphere surface including in continuous phase which promptly released. For in vitro antifungal testing, all AmB lipid formulations were equal and more effective than both AmB itself and Fungizone®. These observations suggested that AmB loaded SLNs, nanostructured lipid carriers and modified SLNs by blending lecithin could enhance AmB solubility, prolong release characteristics, reduce toxicity and improve antifungal activity."
"Performance of reconstruction and identification of τ leptons decaying to hadrons and vτ in pp collisions at s=13 TeV  2018 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration..The algorithm developed by the CMS Collaboration to reconstruct and identify τ leptons produced in proton-proton collisions at s=7 and 8 TeV, via their decays to hadrons and a neutrino, has been significantly improved. The changes include a revised reconstruction of π0 candidates, and improvements in multivariate discriminants to separate τ leptons from jets and electrons. The algorithm is extended to reconstruct τ leptons in highly Lorentz-boosted pair production, and in the high-level trigger. The performance of the algorithm is studied using proton-proton collisions recorded during 2016 at s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The performance is evaluated in terms of the efficiency for a genuine τ lepton to pass the identification criteria and of the probabilities for jets, electrons, and muons to be misidentified as τ leptons. The results are found to be very close to those expected from Monte Carlo simulation."
"A Study on the Evaluation Tendency of Thermal Sensation in Tropical Region - Targeting short time residents - Targeting s  2018 Web Portal IOP. All rights reserved.Climate change is getting more and more serious issue in the world. This is known as caused by the increase of carbon dioxide. To stop the increase, many countries agreed to the Paris Agreement in 2015. When to discuss the climate change, temperature drop and increase are focused more often. The big change of the temperature, especially the rise of the temperature, causes the more usage of air conditioning system, and it also causes more energy consumption. In addition, the usage of the air conditioning system is affected by both indoor and outdoor thermal environment. The temperature setting of air conditioning system tends to be lower in the countries situated in tropical region than the countries in the other region. This happens because the thermal sensation of human is easily affected by the outdoor environment. For that reason, to grasp the tendency of thermal sensation in outdoor space is important. In addition, the tendency of short time residence is necessary to wipe out the influence of the thermal environment adjustment by long time living. For that reason, this research targeted the thermal evaluation tendency of short time residents in Bangkok and carried out subject experiments in outdoor spaces to develop landscape design method. As the result of analysis, a different tendency was grasped at one of the measuring points with open sky."
"A Study on the Effect of Environment Sound on Human Thermal Sensation  2018 Web Portal IOP. All rights reserved.In recent years, there have been several devastations caused by the global climate change. Global climate change is considered as relating to the global warming and is becoming a serious problem. Global warming is related to the increase of carbon dioxide. The increase of the carbon dioxide is caused by the energy consumption increase. In addition, air conditioning dominates the large ratio of the energy consumption. Furthermore, according to the huge earthquake happened on March 11, 2011 in Japan, the country's energy policy is facing a turning point, which is to establish less harmful and less energy based society than ever. For that reason, to decrease the energy consumption, how to reduce the energy consumption by the air-conditioning is an important issue. There have been several research relating to the topic. However, those researches did not study on the effect of the environment sound on the human thermal sensation. For that reason, the purpose of this research is to clarify the effect of environment sound on human thermal sensation. As the result of this study, the environment sounds, such as ""Rain"" ""Stream"" ""Water Bamboo"" showed the effect to lower the human thermal sensation."
"Applying Psychic Distance to Services Internationalization: A Case Study of Thai Caregivers and Japanese Elderly  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.This study applied psychic distance concept to the internationalization of healthcare service. The findings found that the psychic distances perceived by Japanese elderly and Thai caregivers toward their counterparts were asymmetric and varied across dimensions. Moreover, the respondents’ experience with a country affected their psychic distance toward that country. These findings extend the theoretical lens by clarifying the key characteristics of psychic distance, especially in international service, that psychic distance from service providers’ and recipients’ perspectives affect service expectation and performance. It also suggests practitioners to arrange working environments and training program to satisfy service providers and recipients."
"Bin monsters for promoting waste separation behavior  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.The aim of this study was to explore the application of recycling bins to improve waste separation practices of undergraduate students from the Department of Environmental Science in the Faculty of Science at Chulalongkorn University. Bin monsters, waste separation bins shaped like monsters, were created by 11 undergraduate students in the Environmental Science Communication course. The results showed that most participants (undergraduate students from the Department of Environmental Science) had a good working knowledge of waste separation and a positive attitude toward recycling. However, their sorting behavior did not correspond with their knowledge or attitude. To increase their awareness and improve their behavior in solid waste separation, the program should be continued and more bin monsters should be deployed."

"Prevalence of somatic KCNJ5 mutations in Thai patients with aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas  2018 Endocrine Society.Somatic KCNJ5 mutations result in excess aldosterone production and are reported to be more common in Asia than elsewhere. To assess the prevalence of somaticKCNJ5mutations inThai patientswith aldosteroneproducing adrenal adenomas (APAs) in a single tertiary center, we analyzed the paraffin-embedded tissue of KCNJ5 mutations from 96 patients with sporadic APAs who underwent unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy at our center during 2007 to 2016. We also assessed the clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and biochemistry and histologic differences among patients with and without somatic KCNJ5 mutations. Of the 96 patients with APA, 67 (70%) had somatic mutations of the KCNJ5 gene: 39 patients with p.G151R, 26 patients with p.L168R, one patient with p.T158A, and one patient with p.W126R. All patients presented with hypertension. Hypokalemia was documented in 98% of patients. The hypertension cure rate at 1 year after surgery was 35%. Patients with somatic KCNJ5 mutations required more potassium supplementation and had adrenal histology compatible with zona fasciculata-like cells compared with patients without the mutations (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in preoperative plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma renin activity, aldosterone/renin ratio, potassium level, treatment of hypertension, tumor size, and hypertension cure rate among patients in the KCNJ5-mutant and nonmutant groups. In a multivariate analysis, a higher PAC was associated with the presence of somatic KCNJ5 mutations. In summary, the prevalence of somatic KCNJ5mutations inpatientswith sporadic APAs inThailand, anAsian country with residents of different ethnic backgrounds, is comparable to previous reports in Asia."
"Changes in transient elastography in early cirrhotic patients after receiving nonselective B-blocker for primary variceal bleeding prophylaxis: Three-month follow up  2018 Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. JGH Open: An open access journal of gastroenterology and hepatology published by Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Background and Aim: A nonselective B-blocker (NSBB) is recommended for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. The impact of treatment with NSBB on modulating transient elastography (TE) has not been reported. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of NSBB treatment on TE in early cirrhotic patients. Methods: In this prospective study, we enrolled all early cirrhotic patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and showed small esophageal varices (EV) at our institute for a period of 1 year. The TE and heart rate (HR) of all participants were measured before and 3 months after receiving NSBB. Results: Thirty-nine patients receiving propanolol for 3 months were analyzed. There were 16 patients in the HR responder group (41%) and 23 patients in the HR nonresponder group (59%). The reduction of TE was preferably found in the HR responder group compared with the HR nonresponder group, in which mean changes in TE were −5.6 and −0.7 kPa, respectively (P = 0.23). In addition, we categorized the patients using their TE responses. Twenty-five patients (64.1%) showed reduced TE during the follow-up period, in which the mean TE value change was −2.94 kPa. Using correlation analysis, TE and HR responses were insignificantly correlated (r = 0.23, P = 0.15). Conclusion: The NSBB administered for 3 months mainly improved TE value in early cirrhotic patients even though the changes of HR and TE did not correlate. Further study is needed to confirm whether the monitoring of TE change may be a better predictor for pharmacological response than the HR response."
"Antioxidant activities of local oregano and sweet basil leaves and application in a natural antioxidant enriched ravioli  2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia.Total phenolic contents (TPC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities of methanolic extracts of local oregano and sweet basil were appraised and the ratio of oregano:sweet basil at 50:50 was most suitable for incorporation into the ravioli padding. When stored at -18oC for 4 months, the ravioli test sample (added with 5% of the blended herbs) was more stable in terms of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values in comparison with the control. Although the herb blend adversely affected colour values of the samples, it helped improve sensory properties of the ravioli. Results of this study indicate the potential use of occidental and oriental blended herbs in the pasta product with the dairy-based padding."
"Epidemiology and prognostic importance of atrial fibrillation in kidney transplant recipients: A meta-analysis  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This meta-analysis was conducted with the aims to summarize all available evidence on (1) prevalence of pre-existing atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or incidence of AF following kidney transplantation; (2) the outcomes of kidney transplant recipients with AF; and (3) the trends of estimated incidence of AF following kidney transplantation over time. A literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database from inception through March 2018. We included studies that reported (1) prevalence of pre-existing AF or incidence of AF following kidney transplantation or (2) outcomes of kidney transplant recipients with AF. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined utilizing random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42018086192). Eight cohort studies with 137,709 kidney transplant recipients were enrolled. Overall, the pooled estimated prevalence of pre-existing AF in patients undergoing kidney transplantation was 7.0% (95% CI: 5.6–8.8%) and pooled estimated incidence of AF following kidney transplantation was 4.9% (95% CI: 1.7–13.0%). Meta-regression analyses were performed and showed no significant correlations between year of study and either prevalence of pre-existing AF (p = 0.93) or post-operative AF after kidney transplantation (p = 0.16). The pooled odds ratios (OR) of mortality among kidney transplant recipients with AF was 1.86 (3 studies; 95% CI: 1.03–3.35). In addition, AF is also associated with death-censored allograft loss (2 studies; OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.02–2.35) and stroke (3 studies; OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.11–5.78) among kidney transplant recipients. Despite advances in medicine, incidence of AF following kidney transplant does not seem to decrease over time. In addition, there is a significant association of AF with increased mortality, allograft loss, and stroke after kidney transplantation."

Hom Nil (Oryza sativa), a Thai black rice, contains polyphenolic compounds which have antioxidant properties. The objective of this study was to investigate physicochemical properties of Hom Nil rice flour (HN) and its application in gluten free bread by using Hom Mali 105 rice flour (HM) as the reference. The results demonstrated that HN flour had significantly higher average particle sizes (150 ± 0.58 µm), whereas the content of amylose (17.6 ± 0.2%) was lower than HM flour (particle sizes = 140 ± 0.58 µm; amylose content = 21.3 ± 0.6%). Furthermore, HN contained higher total phenolic compounds (TPC) (2.68 ± 0.2 mg GAE/g flour), total anthocyanins (293 ± 30 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside/g flour), and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (73.5 ± 1.5 mM FeSO 4 /g) than HM flour (TPC = 0.15 mg GAE/g flour and FRAP = 2.24 mM FeSO 4 /g flour). In thermal properties, the onset temperature (T o ), the peak temperature (T p ) and the conclusion (T c ) temperature of HN flour were similar to the values of HM flour. However, HN flour had lower enthalpy change (∆H) than HM flour. The results showed that HN flour had lower swelling power and higher solubility than HM flour at the temperature between 55 ◦ C and 95 ◦ C. In pasting properties, HN flour also showed lower peak, trough and breakdown viscosity than HM flour. In addition, the bread samples prepared by HN flour had higher value of hardness and lower value of cohesiveness than the bread prepared from HM flour. Taken together, the findings suggest that HN flour could be used as an alternative gluten-free ingredient for bread product."
"Diversity of ethanol fermenting yeasts in coconut inflorescence sap and their application potential  2018 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage. All Rights Reserved.Ten ethanol fermenting yeast species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lachancea fermentati, Pichia kudriavzevii, Shizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida tropicalis, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Saccharomycodes ludwigii, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, Wickerhamomyces anomalus and P. manshurica were isolated from coconut inflorescence sap in Thailand. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to be the dominant species (65%), where 30% of the S. cerevisiae strains isolated could grow at 40 °C, strain NT029 gave the highest ethanol yield (64.5 g/l) and strain NC018 had the desired characteristics of a baker's yeast strain (high CO2 production, high biomass yield and fast flocculation). Evidently, bread prepared by strain NC018 showed a good texture. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae NC027 was suitable for ethanol production, with maximum ethanol yields (66.92 and 102.26 g/l) and ethanol productivity levels (1.39 and 2.13 g/l/h) in medium containing 18% (w/v) glucose and 10% (w/v) molasses at 30 °C, which were higher than the reference ethanol producing strain, S. cerevisiae TISTR 5596. Finally, S. cerevisiae NL026 assimilated glycerol, which may indicate its potential as a value addition strain for fermentation of low-price glycerol waste."
"Nongenomic effect of aldosterone on angiotensin II type 1 receptor dimerization in human renal proximal tubular cells: Implications for endoplasmic reticulum stress  2018 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage. All rights reserved.In vitro studies have showed that aldosterone increases oxidative stress molecules through a nongenomic effect. Oxidative stress induces angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) dimerization and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to renal tubular damage. However, the nongenomic effect of aldosterone on AT1R dimerization and ER stress in renal cells has not been determined. Here, we examined the nongenomic action of aldosterone in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) to better understand the underlying mechanisms. HK-2 cells, human renal PTECs, were exposed to vehicle or aldosterone for 30 min. In two additional groups, the cells were pretreated with eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blocker or apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, for 30 min before aldosterone incubation. Protein abundances of dimeric/monomeric forms of AT1R, p47phox (a cytosolic part of NADPH oxidase), and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcription factor responsive to ER stress, were determined by Western blotting. Aldosterone nongenomically increased plasma membrane protein expression of AT1R dimeric forms in a time- and dose-dependent manners. The levels of the cytosolic p47phox protein declined while the membranous protein level was enhanced following aldosterone treatment. The aldosterone induced alteration in these two proteins was abolished by pretreatment with eplerenone or apocynin. In addition, aldosterone (100 nM) induced nuclear ATF4 protein accumulation in a time-dependent fashion, which was blocked by apocynin and partially attenuated by eplerenone. Aldosterone nongenomically increased AT1R dimerization and nuclear ATF4 protein accumulation dependent on MR and NADPH oxidase activation. Hence aldosterone could induce AT1R dimerization and activate the endoplasmic reticulum stress response."
"Factors associated with self-management among Vietnamese adults with type 2 diabetes  2018 The Authors. Nursing Open published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim: The study described diabetes self-management (DSM), diabetes knowledge, family and friends’ support, healthcare providers’ support, belief in treatment effectiveness and diabetes management self-efficacy, and explored DSM's associations among Vietnamese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Design: A cross-sectional design was applied. Methods: The study used self-report questionnaires to collect data from 198 participants. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used for data analysis. Results: Vietnamese adults with T2DM performed DSM limitedly in certain aspects. They had strong belief in treatment effectiveness, good family and friends support, limited diabetes knowledge, healthcare professional support and self-efficacy. Their DSM was directly associated with diabetes knowledge, family and friends’ support, healthcare providers’ support, belief in treatment effectiveness and diabetes management self-efficacy. Their DSM was indirectly associated with diabetes knowledge and family and friends’ support through their belief in treatment effectiveness and diabetes management self-efficacy."
"Preparation and characterization of poly(lactic acid) with adipate ester added as a plasticizer  SAGE Publications.Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was thermally blended with adipate ester (AE) to enhance the toughness of PLA. All specimens which were biodegradable materials were prepared using a plasticorder. Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the PLA structure was looser because of the presence of the AE additive. The elongation at break and biodegradable property increased substantially with increasing amounts of AE. The results reveal that excessive amounts of plasticizer would cause the exudation of AE from the PLA/AE composites, which was ascribed to the plasticizer migration phenomenon."
"War, migration and the origins of the Thai sex industry  The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of European Economic Association. All rights reserved.This paper analyzes the determinants behind the spatial distribution of the sex industry in Thailand. We relate the development of the sex industry to an early temporary demand shock, that is, US military presence during the Vietnam War. Comparing the surroundings of Thai military bases used by the US army to districts close to unused Thai bases, we find that there are currently five times more commercial sex workers in districts near former US bases. The development of the sex industry is also explained by a high price elasticity of supply due to female migration from regions affected by an agricultural crisis. Finally, we study a consequence induced by the large numbers of sex workers in few red-light districts: the HIV outbreak in the early 1990s."
"From molecules to mechanisms: Functional proteomics and its application to renal tubule physiology  2018 American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.Classical physiological studies using electrophysiological, biophysical, biochemical, and molecular techniques have created a detailed picture of molecular transport, bioenergetics, contractility and movement, and growth, as well as the regulation of these processes by external stimuli in cells and organisms. Newer systems biology approaches are beginning to provide deeper and broader understanding of these complex biological processes and their dynamic responses to a variety of environmental cues. In the past decade, advances in mass spectrometry–based proteomic technologies have provided invaluable tools to further elucidate these complex cellular processes, thereby confirming, complementing, and advancing common views of physiology. As one notable example, the application of proteomics to study the regulation of kidney function has yielded novel insights into the chemical and physical processes that tightly control body fluids, electrolytes, and metabolites to provide optimal microenvironments for various cellular and organ functions. Here, we systematically review, summarize, and discuss the most significant key findings from functional proteomic studies in renal epithelial physiology. We also identify further improvements in technological and bioinformatics methods that will be essential to advance precision medicine in nephrology."

"Interleukin 6 promotes an in vitro mineral deposition by stem cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth  2018 The Authors.Interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays various roles including stem cell regulation. The present study investigated the effect of IL-6 on cell proliferation, colony forming unit ability, stem cell marker expression and differentiation ability in stem cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs). We reported that the isolated cells from dental pulp tissues for deciduous teeth expressed CD44, CD90 and CD105 but not CD45. These cells were able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and neuronal-like cells. IL-6 treatment resulted in the significant increase of NANOG, SOX2 and REX1 mRNA expression. However, IL-6 had no effect on cell proliferation and colony forming unit ability. IL-6 did not alter adipogenic and neurogenic differentiation potency. IL-6 supplementation in osteogenic medium led to a significant increase of mineralization. Furthermore, IL-6 upregulated ALP, ANKH and PIT1 mRNA levels. In conclusion, IL-6 participates in the regulation of pluripotent marker expression and is also involved in mineralization process of SHEDs. Hence, IL-6 could be employed as a supplementary substance in culture medium to maintain stemness and to induce osteogenic induction in SHEDs for future regenerative cell therapy."
"First record of Ceriporia inflata and Ceriporia lacerata (Phanerochaetaceae, Basidiomycota) from Indonesian tropical forest  2018 Kasetsart UniversityResupinate fungi (Basidiomycota) are wood-inhabiting fungi found abundantly in the tropical rainforest of Indonesia. A survey in East Kalimantan discovered two new recorded species for Indonesia: Ceriporia inflata and Ceriporia lacerata. The morphological characteristics of these two resupinate fungi were similar to those of the holotype specimens found in sub-tropical forest in China and Japan. Based on maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacers and large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA sequences, these two new records were placed within the Ceriporia group."
"Acute kidney injury in leptospirosis: Overview and perspectives  2018, Hainan Medical University. E-edition Published by Wolters Kluwer India Pvt. Ltd. All rights reserved.Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease disseminated through the centuries in the whole world which causes symptoms that go from self-limited diseases to hemorrhagic manifestations and organ failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI), composing the severe disease known as the Weil's syndrome. Mortality rates varies according to the clinical presentation and usually increases when kidney injury is present, and is even higher in the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage. There are recent advances in the search for novel biomarkers of renal involvement and early detection of AKI in leptospirosis, as well as in its pathophysiology. We review in this article the clinical aspects of leptospirosis-associated AKI and the perspectives for future research."
"Measurement of the groomed jet mass in PbPb and pp collisions at √sNN=5.02 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A measurement of the groomed jet mass in PbPb and pp collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC is presented. Jet grooming is a recursive procedure which sequentially removes soft constituents of a jet until a pair of hard subjets is found. The resulting groomed jets can be used to study modifications to the parton shower evolution in the presence of the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion collisions. Predictions of groomed jet properties from the pythia and herwig++ event generators agree with the measurements in pp collisions. When comparing the results from the most central PbPb collisions to pp data, a hint of an increase of jets with large jet mass is observed, which could originate from additional medium-induced radiation at a large angle from the jet axis. However, no modification of the groomed mass of the core of the jet is observed for all PbPb centrality classes. The PbPb results are also compared to predictions from the jewel and q-pythia event generators, which predict a large modification of the groomed mass not observed in the data.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Preparation and Properties of Poly(lactic Acid)/PLA-g-ABS Blends  2018, The Korean Fiber Society and Springer Nature B.V.PLA/PLA-g-ABS blends were prepared and evaluated for mechanical properties performance. Firstly, carboxylic acid functionalized ABS particles were synthesized by grafting polymethacrylic acid (PMAA) onto ABS particle surface using potassium persulfate as an initiator. The reaction was followed by FTIR analysis. The resultant carboxylated ABS was melt mixed with virgin PLA in an internal mixer to obtain PLA/PLA-g-ABS blends. The obtained PLA/PLA-g-ABS blends were subject to injection molding to obtain specimens for testing evaluation. It was found that impact resistance values significantly outperformed neat PLA by 60 %, 87 %, and 150 % for PLA/PLA-g-ABS 10 wt%, PLA/PLA-g-ABS 20 wt%, and PLA/PLA-g-ABS 30 wt%, respectively. A significant increase in impact strength was contributable to ABS rubber which exhibited even dispersion and good interfacial adhesion. The impact strength was dependent on the percent loading of PLAg-ABS; the more the PLA/PLA-g-ABS the higher the impact strength value. In a similar manner, tensile strength increases when loaded with PLA/PLA-g-ABS albeit at lesser effect. Considering the percent elongation, a massive increase in percent elongation was recorded in case of PLA/PLA-g-ABS 20 wt% and PLA/PLA-g-ABS 30 wt%, implying that these blends were extremely flexible and tough when compared to neat PLA, control, and PLA/PLA-g-ABS 10 wt%."
"Molecular identification, L-lactic acid production, and antibacterial activity of Bacillus strains isolated from soils  2018 Vasana Tolieng et al.Fourteen spore-forming bacteria isolated from soils were evaluated for their taxonomic characterization, lactic acid production, and antimicrobial activity. They were belonged to the genus Bacillus and were closely related to Bacillus coagulans LMG 6326T with 97.48%-98.48% similarity, based on 16S rRNA gene analyses. Repetitive genomic element-PCR (REP-PCR) fingerprinting using the primers sets; BOX-PCR, ERIC-PCR, GTG5-PCR, and REPPCR were used to differentiate among the species. Clustering of the isolates with the PCR fingerprint dendrograms obtained two groups. Group 1 consists of two isolates, JC-3 and JC-11 (14.29%), and the rest of isolates (85.71%) were distributed in another group. Based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis and REP-PCR and the phenotypic characteristics, they were classified as a novel Bacillus species. These isolates were screened for lactic acid production and antimicrobial efficiency, and the results revealed that they produced L-lactic acid in the range of 1.7 ± 0.1 g/l-32.6 ± 0.7 g/l at 98.58% ± 0.06%-100.00% ± 0.00% optical purity. Among them, only JC-19 was found to show inhibitory activity against Kocuria rhizophila ATCC 9341."

"Liver transplantation and atrial fibrillation: A meta-analysis  The Author(s) 2018.AIM To assess prevalence of pre-existing atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or incidence of AF following liver transplantation, and the trends of patient's outcomes overtime; to evaluate impact of pre-existing AF and post-operative AF on patient outcomes following liver transplantation. METHODS A literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database from inception through March 2018. We included studies that reported: (1) prevalence of pre-existing AF or incidence of AF following liver transplantation; or (2) outcomes of liver transplant recipients with AF. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined utilizing randomeffect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, No. CRD42018093644). RESULTS Twelve observational studies with a total of 38586 liver transplant patients were enrolled. Overall, the pooled estimated prevalence of pre-existing AF in patients undergoing liver transplantation was 5.4% (95%CI: 4.9%-5.9%) and pooled estimated incidence of AF following liver transplantation was 8.5% (95%CI: 5.2%-13.6%). Meta-regression analyses were performed and showed no significant correlations between year of study and either prevalence of pre-existing AF (P = 0.08) or post-operative AF after liver transplantation (P = 0.54). The pooled OR of mortality among liver transplant recipients with pre-existing AF was 2.34 (2 studies; 95%CI: 1.10-5.00). In addition, pre-existing AF is associated with postoperative cardiovascular complications among liver transplant recipients (3 studies; OR: 5.15, 95%CI: 2.67-9.92, I2 = 64%). With limited studies, two studies suggested significant association between new-onset AF and poor clinical outcomes including mortality, cerebrovascular events, post-transplant acute kidney injury, and increased risk of graft failure among liver transplant recipients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The overall estimated prevalence of pre-existing AF and incidence of AF following liver transplantation are 5.4% and 8.5%, respectively. Incidence of AF following liver transplant does not seem to decrease overtime. Preexisting AF and new-onset AF are potentially associated with poor clinical outcomes post liver transplantation."
"Adiponectin as a novel biomarker for liver fibrosis  The Author(s) 2018.Adiponectin is known to play primary roles in the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, emerging evidence indicates beneficial effects of adiponectin on liver fibrosis; however, the exact mechanisms of this action remain unclear. Herein, we aimed to summarize the recent findings regarding the role of adiponectin in liver fibrogenesis and update the current comprehensive knowledge regarding usefulness of adiponectin-based treatments in liver fibrosis. Adiponectin has been demonstrated to have an anti-fibrotic action in the liver by blocking the activation of hepatic stellate cellmediated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptoralpha pathways, which in turn diminish the expression of pro-fibrotic genes. In addition, hyperadiponectinemia was noted in patients with various chronic liver diseases (CLDs)-related liver fibrosis. An increase in circulating adiponectin levels was also found to be associated with the development of liver fibrosis, indicating a role of adiponectin as a non-invasive biomarker for predicting the progression of liver fibrosis. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that adiponectin may be developed as a new therapeutic candidate for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Nonetheless, future observations are still necessary to fully elucidate the extent of the effects of adiponectin on liver fibrotic outcomes, in order to modify adiponectin as an anti-fibrotic therapy that would speed up fibrosis reversal in patients with CLD."

"Wear resistance of laser cladded Stellite 31 coating on AISI 316L steel  Carl Hanser Verlag, München.Laser cladding of Stellite 31 powder on AISI 316L plate size of 50 × 50 × 25 mm using diode laser powers of 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0 kW was produced. The wear tests of clad layers were investigated according to ASTM G99. Equiaxed and elongated grains were found in clad layer using laser powers of 3.5, 4.0 kW and 4.0, 5.0 kW, respectively. Compressive residual stress was detected at the surface of the clad layers. They decreased as laser power increased. After polishing, compressive residual stress and the wear resistance of the clad layers subjected to higher laser power were higher than those subjected to lower laser power. The friction coefficient of the clad layer subjected to higher laser power was lower than that subjected to lower laser power."
"Effects of ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 Polymorphisms on treatment responses in Thai metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with Irinotecan-based chemotherapy  2018, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.Purpose: Irinotecan is an anticancer medicine which is used mostly in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment as second or third line chemotherapy. Several factors affect its efficacy and toxicity, including pharmacogenomics. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 polymorphisms on treatment responses in irinotecan-based chemotherapy in 49 Thai mCRC patients. Materials and Methods: Forty-nine participants with mCRC enrolled in this study received irinotecan-based chemotherapy from January to June 2017. Genotypic analyses of ABCC2 (C > T, rs717620) and SLCO1B1 (A > G, rs2306283) were performed. Treatment responses were evaluated after at least three cycles of chemotherapy were given. Results: Allele frequencies of ABCC2 (C > T) and SLCO1B1 (A > G) were found at 18.37% and 78.57%, respectively. Neither was associated with treatment responses. However, combined genotypes of ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 tended to be associated with clinical benefits in terms of partial responses (PR) and stable disease (SD). All patients (100%) with at least one variant allele of SLCO1B1 and ABCC2 were in a PR or SD group, while patients with other genotypes had progressive disease (PD) at 45.5% to 70%, (p = 0.059). Conclusion: The combined effect of ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 polymorphisms tended to be associated with treatment responses in irinotecan-based treated mCRC patients. Therefore, such polymorphisms could be factors impacting inter-individual variation of irinotecan efficacy in Thai mCRC patients."

After risk adjustment, the significant predictive factors were higher ASA physical status (III, IV, V), long anesthetic duration (longer than 120 minutes), vascular surgery, reintubation within 24 hours post-anesthesia, and cardiac arrest within 24 hours post-anesthesia. Reintubation within 24 hours post-anesthesia had the highest odds ratio of 8.36. Conclusion: The predictive factors for unplanned ICU admission after anesthesia in Thailand were higher ASA physical status (III, IV, V), long anesthetic duration (longer than 120 minutes), vascular surgery, reintubation within 24 hours post-anesthesia, and cardiac arrest within 24 hours post-anesthesia."
"Charged-particle nuclear modification factors in XeXe collisions at √sNN=5.44 TeV  2018, The Author(s).The differential yields of charged particles having pseudorapidity within |η| < 1 are measured using xenon-xenon (XeXe) collisions at sNN=5.44 TeV. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.42 μb−1, were collected in 2017 by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The yields are reported as functions of collision centrality and transverse momentum, pT, from 0.5 to 100 GeV. A previously reported pT spectrum from proton-proton collisions at s=5.02 TeV is used for comparison after correcting for the difference in center-of-mass energy. The nuclear modification factors using this reference, RAA *, are constructed and compared to previous measurements and theoretical predictions. In head-on collisions, the RAA * has a value of 0.17 in the pT range of 6–8 GeV, but increases to approximately 0.7 at 100 GeV. Above ≈6 GeV, the XeXe data show a notably smaller suppression than previous results for lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV when compared at the same centrality (i.e., the same fraction of total cross section). However, the XeXe suppression is slightly greater than that for PbPb in events having a similar number of participating nucleons."
"Measurement of the production cross section for single top quarks in association with W bosons in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A measurement is presented of the associated production of a single top quark and a W boson in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV by the CMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC. The data collected corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The measurement is performed using events with one electron and one muon in the final state along with at least one jet originated from a bottom quark. A multivariate discriminant, exploiting the kinematic properties of the events, is used to separate the signal from the dominant t t ¯ background. The measured cross section of 63.1 ± 1.8(stat) ± 6.4(syst) ± 2.1 (lumi) pb is in agreement with the standard model expectation.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Efficacy and Safety of Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest for the Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding: A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Clinical Trial  2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.Background: To investigate the efficacy and safety of estradiol valerate (EV)/dienogest (DNG) for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in Asian and non-Asian women desiring contraception. Materials and Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase III study, women were randomized 2:1 to receive EV/DNG or placebo tablets daily for seven 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in menstrual blood loss (MBL) volume between the run-in and efficacy phases (90 days each). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of women with successful treatment (i.e., no episodes of MBL ≥80 mL and a decrease of <50% in MBL), percent change in MBL from the run-in phase, and change in hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study. Results: Of the 341 women (mean age 34.7 ± 7.7 years; 309 Asians, 32 non-Asians) randomized, 270 completed the study. Mean reduction in MBL volume from run-in phase was significantly greater with EV/DNG than placebo (366.75 mL vs. 149.14 mL; p < 0.0001), with ∼52% and 12% of women, respectively, experiencing successful treatment. Percent decrease in MBL volume from the run-in phase was significantly greater with EV/DNG than placebo (63.5% vs. 24.8%; p < 0.0001). Hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels were increased with EV/DNG compared with placebo. Study drug-related AEs were reported in 16.3% and 8.2% of women with EV/DNG and placebo, respectively, none of which were of severe intensity. Conclusions: EV/DNG may be a safe and effective option in the treatment of HMB in Asian and non-Asian women who desire contraception."
"Oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over different VOx/SBA-15 catalysts  2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In this present study, characteristics and catalytic properties of different VOx/SBA-15 catalysts for oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde were determined and well related. First, the SBA-15 supports were synthesized using the sol-gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) methods with Zr and La modification. Then, VOx species (2 wt% of V) were deposited on different SBA-15 supports. Among all catalysts, the V-Zr-La/SBA-15-HT showed the highest catalytic activity having 80% conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca. 38% at 400 °C in non-oxidative dehydrogenation, while 98% conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca. 40% were obtained for this catalyst at lower temperature (300 °C) in oxidative dehydrogenation. In fact, two of the most powerful techniques used to elucidate the nature of VOx species dispersed on Zr-La/SBA -15 supports were X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption. It is worth noting that isolated monomeric VOx species, particularly the V4+ species, as well as the amounts of weak basic sites essentially played important role in non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde."
"A model predicting short-term mortality in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis and concomitant infection Copyright  2018 the Author(s).Infection is a common cause of death in patients with advanced cirrhosis. We aimed to develop a predictive model in Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) class C cirrhotics hospitalized with infection for optimizing treatment and improving outcomes. Clinical information was retrospectively abstracted from 244 patients at Tianjin Third Central Hospital, China (cohort 1). Factors associated with mortality were determined using logistic regression. The model for predicting 90-day mortality was then constructed by decision tree analysis. The model was further validated in 91 patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (cohort 2) and 82 patients at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, Korea (cohort 3). The predictive performance of the model was compared with that of the CTP, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), MELD-Na, Chronic Liver Failure–Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and the North American consortium for the Study of End-stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) models. The 3-month mortality was 58%, 58%, and 54% in cohort 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In cohort 1, respiratory failure, renal failure, international normalized ratio, total bilirubin, and neutrophil percentage were determinants of 3-month mortality, with odds ratios of 16.6, 3.3, 2.0, 1.1, and 1.03, respectively (P < .05). These parameters were incorporated into the decision tree model, yielding area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.804. The model had excellent reproducibility in the U.S. (AUROC 0.808) and Korea cohort (AUROC 0.809). The proposed model has the highest AUROC and best Youden index of 0.488 and greatest overall correctness of 75%, compared with other models evaluated. The proposed model reliably predicts survival of advanced cirrhotics with infection in both Asian and U.S. populations."
"Disruption of polyhydroxybutyrate synthesis redirects carbon flow towards glycogen synthesis in synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Overexpressing glgC/glgA  The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists. All rights reserved.The photoautotrophic Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) is known for its α-polyglucan (glycogen) synthesis to serve as a carbon storage compound. In this study, the glgC- and glgA-overexpressing Synechocystis strain with the disruption of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis (▴GCAX-δ ""BK) showed an increased glycogen production. This engineered strain had a high glycogen content of 38.3% (g g -1 dry cell weight) as compared with 27.4% in the phaA knockout strain (δBK) and 34.8% in the glgC/glgA-overexpressing strain (▴GCAX) after 20 d growth. Under nitrogen-deprived growth conditions for 3 d, the ▴GCAX-δ ""BK strain showed a further increase in glycogen content from 27.0% to 36.0%. Furthermore, the engineered strains grown under ionic, osmotic or oxidative stress conditions had an increase of glycogen accumulation, whereas no increase was observed in the wild type. The maximum glycogen content was 54.0% in the ▴GCAX-δ ""BK strain treated with 3 mM H2O2. The overall results indicated that in the absence of PHB synthesis, Synechocystis cells redirected the carbon flow towards the synthesis of glycogen as an alternative physiological responsive compound especially under stress conditions."
"Electrochemical bicarbonate reduction in the presence of Diisopropylamine on sliver oxide in alkaline sodium bicarbonate medium  2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.In this study, the reduction of bicarbonate in the presence four amines on a silver oxide/ carbon nanotube (Ag2O/CNT) composite electrode has been investigated. The studied amines includes ethanolamine (MEA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), diisopropylamine (DIPA) and aminoethylpiperazine (AEP). Regardless of amine type, in the absence of a bicarbonate solution, no reduction/oxidation peaks were observed. However, in the presence of bicarbonate, a single reduction peak along with simultaneous H2 evolution was clearly observed. The cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that only diisopropylamine (DIPA) had a significant catalytic effect toward bicarbonate reduction on the composite electrode. No peak was observed in the anodic direction of the reverse scans, suggesting the irreversible nature of the electrochemical process. The effect of scan rate revealed that the irreversible reduction mechanism is governed by both diffusion and adsorption pathways. In addition of carbonate ions, format ions also have been detected in liquid phase. In order to study the mechanism of bicarbonate reduction in the DIPA solution on Ag2O/CNT electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed. The EIS results showed that the charge transfer resistance decreased when the potential decreased from -0.1 to -0.9 V then faded with a further rise in potential to up to -1.9 V. In addition, an inductive loop under certain conditions was observed in the complex plane due to the formation of adsorbed intermediates onto the electrode surface."
"Four square step test with foam is more accurate than those without foam for discriminating between older adults with and without fall history  2018 Human Kinetics, Inc.Objective: The aim was to compare the use of the four square step test (FSST) and the FSST with foam surface (FSST + foam) scores for discriminating between adults, faller older adults, and nonfaller older adults. Methods: Fifty-four participants (18 for each group) were assessed using the FSST and FSST + foam. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated and used to compare the accuracy of the tests. Results: The FSST + foam was more accurate than FSST for discriminating between faller and nonfaller older adults (area under the curves were 0.765 and 0.725, respectively) and between nonfaller older adults and adults (area under the curves were 0.99 and 0.95, respectively). The cutoff score for discriminating between faller and nonfaller older adults was 11.21, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.889 and 0.611, respectively. Conclusion: FSST + foam could be used as an alternative assessment for discriminating between adults, faller, and nonfaller older adults."
"Equality in financial access to healthcare in Cambodia from 2004 to 2014  The Author(s) 2018.Since the end of its internal conflict in 1998, Cambodia has experienced tremendous developments in the social, economic and health sectors, with the government embarking on substantial reforms in health financing. Health equity funds that have improved access to public health services for poor people have gradually been extended to the entire country. Using the World Health Organization's methods for the analysis of healthcare expenditure and household survey data from the 2004, 2009 and 2014 Cambodian Socio-Economic Survey, we assessed trends in reported illness, utilization of healthcare services and associated financial burden on households. The impact of out-of-pocket expenditures for health on catastrophic health expenditures, poverty headcount and depth over the same 10-year period are presented, disaggregated by consumption quintile and place of residence (rural, urban and capital). At the aggregated national level, evolution of these indicators was very positive and correlates with a substantial increase in the capacity-to-pay of households, which reduced the average financial burden on households. However, over time inequalities grew between rural and urban areas. By 2014, the national incidence of catastrophic health expenditure was 4.9%, but four times more likely among rural households than their peers in the capital. For rural households with members seeking medical care, catastrophic health expenditure incidence was 12.3%. The impoverishment rate due to health spending among the lowest consumption quintile was 15.3%; the highest rate in this analysis. These findings suggest that economic and health sector developments have indeed benefited many Cambodian people. However, these gains mainly benefited urban residents; especially those in the capital city. We argue that more resources should be allocated to rural health services to address inequalities and healthcare-related financial hardship, which traps vulnerable people into poverty."
"Molecular dynamics provides insight into how N251A and N251Y mutations in the active site of Bacillus licheniformis RN-01 levansucrase disrupt production of long-chain levan  2018 Sitthiyotha et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Produced by levansucrase, levan and levan oligosaccharides (GF n ) have potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries such as prebiotics, anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory agents. Previous study reported that Bacillus licheniformis RN-01 levansucrase could produce levan oligosaccharides and long-chain levan. However, its N251A and N251Y mutants could effectively produce short-chain oligosaccharides upto GF 3 , but they could not produce long-chain levan. We hypothesized that these mutations probably reduced GF 3 binding affinity in levansucrase active site that contains fructosyl-Asp93 intermediate and caused GF 3 to be in an unfavorable orientation for transfructosylation; therefore, levansucrase could not effectively extend GF 3 by one fructosyl residue to produce GF 4 and subsequently long-chain levan. However, these mutations probably did not significantly reduce binding affinity or drastically change orientation of GF 2 ; therefore, levansucrase could still extend GF 2 to produce GF 3 . Using this hypothesis, we employed molecular dynamics to investigate effects of these mutations on GF 2 /GF 3 binding in levansucrase active site. Our results reasonably support this hypothesis as N251A and N251Y mutations did not significantly reduce GF 2 binding affinity, as calculated by MM-GBSA technique and hydrogen bond occupations, or drastically change orientation of GF 2 in levansucrase active site, as measured by distance between atoms necessary for transfructosylation. However, these mutations drastically decreased GF 3 binding affinity and caused GF 3 to be in an unfavorable orientation for transfructosylation. Furthermore, the free energy decomposition and hydrogen bond occupation results suggest the importance of Arg255 in GF 2 /GF 3 binding in levansucrase active site. This study provides important and novel insight into the effects of N251A and N251Y mutations on GF 2 /GF 3 binding in levansucrase active site and how they may disrupt production of long-chain levan. This knowledge could be beneficial in designing levansucrase to efficiently produce levan oligosaccharides with desired length."
"A Novel Technique of Ultrasound-Guided Selective Mandibular Nerve Block with a Lateral Pterygoid Plate Approach: A Cadaveric Study  2018 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.Background and Objectives We aimed to describe a novel technique of ultrasound-guided selective mandibular nerve block with a lateral pterygoid plate (LPP) approach and to assess its feasibility and accuracy in a soft cadaver model. Methods Ten soft cadavers were studied. A curved array ultrasound transducer was applied over 1 side of the face of the cadaver, in an open-mouth position. The transducer was placed transversely below the zygomatic arch and tilted in the caudal-to-cranial direction to identify the boundary of the LPP. The needle was inserted in-plane, in an anterior-to-posterior direction, into the posterior border of the uppermost part of the LPP, and 3 mL of methylene blue was injected. Results Mandibular nerve block was successfully performed in all 10 cadavers using an LPP approach under ultrasound guidance. The mandibular nerve and its branches were seen to be stained with methylene blue in all cadaveric specimens. No accidental injection into the facial nerve or maxillary artery was observed. Conclusions This cadaveric study suggests that this novel technique, using an LPP approach under ultrasound guidance, is helpful for selective mandibular nerve block, with high accuracy and feasibility. Further studies are required to establish its safety and efficacy for clinical application. Clinical Trial Registration This study was registered at the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.in.th), identifier TCTR20160601004."
"Parental status and psychological distress among older Thais  2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdThis study examines whether childless older Thais are more vulnerable to psychological distress relative to older adults with children. Drawing from the 2011 Survey of Older Persons in Thailand (n = 37,936), zero-inflated negative binomial regression methods examine psychological distress of childless older adults relative to coresident and noncoresident parents. Analyses further explore how gender and marital status moderate this relationship. Results show that 40% of older Thais did not experience any symptoms of psychological distress in the past month. Compared to coresident parents, noncoresident parents showed a higher likelihood of experiencing psychological distress but being childless was associated with increased symptoms of psychological distress. While the relationship between parental status and psychological distress did not significantly differ by gender, marital status presents a significant moderating effect. Specifically, widowed childless older adults and widowed noncoresident parents experienced more symptoms of psychological distress relative to their married counterparts. In collectivistic societies, where the family unit is highly valued, and institutional support is weak, being childless and unmarried may negatively affect one's psychological well-being in later life. Children and marriage are protective for older Thais’ psychological well-being. The implications for social welfare policies are discussed."
"Serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein level as a diagnostic marker of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma  2018 The Japan Society of HepatologyAim: Serum glycosylated Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) is a novel marker for staging liver fibrosis and predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence. This study aimed at evaluating the performance of WFA+-M2BP in the diagnosis of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Methods: The WFA+-M2BP levels were measured in stored samples collected at initial diagnosis of 150 patients with HBV-related HCC and 150 age- and gender-matched patients with non-malignant chronic HBV infection. Results: Patients with HCC had higher levels of WFA+-M2BP than those without HCC (3.9 [1.5–20.6] vs. 1.6 [0.4–9.3] cut-off index [COI], P < 0.001). In the HCC group, WFA+-M2BP levels correlated with Child–Pugh classification but did not correlate with HBV markers, α-fetoprotein (AFP), or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. The areas under the curve (AUROC) for differentiating HCC from non-HCC were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89–0.95; P < 0.001) for WFA+-M2BP, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.94; P < 0.001) for AFP, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95–0.98; P < 0.001) for the combination of both markers. At the optimal cut-off (2.4 COI), WFA+-M2BP had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 79.3%, 91.3%, and 85.3%, respectively. The WFA+-M2BP marker was superior to AFP in differentiating early-stage HCC (BCLC stages 0 and A) from cirrhosis with AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68–0.91; P < 0.001) and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60–0.86; P = 0.002), respectively. By univariate analysis, elevated WFA+-M2BP (≥4.0 COI) was correlated with poor overall survival in patients with HCC. Conclusions: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive M2BP showed a better diagnostic performance than AFP in detecting early-stage HCC. Thus, WFA+-M2BP level could represent a promising marker for early diagnosis of HCC in patients with chronic HBV infection."
"A comparative study of dielectric and ferroelectric properties of sol–gel-derived BaTiO3 bulk ceramics with fine and coarse grains  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Fine and coarse-grained BaTiO3 (BTO) ceramics were prepared by conventional sintering of sol–gel-derived BTO nanopowders at 1150 and 1350 °C, respectively. Based on characterization results, fine and coarse-grained BTO ceramics had an average grain size of about 1 and 12 µm, respectively. They exhibited a tetragonal structure with tetragonality (c/a ratio) of 1.0105. The dielectric properties of fine and coarse-grained BTO ceramics were measured in the frequency range of 100 Hz–10 MHz and temperature range of −45–180 °C. A dominant dielectric relaxation was observed at high frequency above 1 MHz for both BTO ceramics. Room-temperature dielectric constant of fine-grained BTO (1502) was greater than that of coarse-grained BTO (1082) at 1 kHz due to the grain size effect. For temperature dependence measurement, dielectric constant of fine-grained BTO was less sensitive with changing temperature at phase transition than coarse-grained BTO. Polarization–electric field (P–E) loop of coarse-grained BTO at room temperature revealed a well-defined hysteresis loop, confirming its ferroelectric switching behavior. In contrast, a lossy hysteresis loop was found for fine-grained BTO owing to its high leakage current. Our results in this work provide a useful information and progress in the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of sol–gel-derived BTO bulk ceramics."
"Petrochemistry of Granitoids Along the Loei Fold Belt, Northeastern Thailand  2018 The Society of Resource GeologyPetrochemical characteristics of Permo-Triassic granitoids from five regions (i) Mung Loei, (ii) Phu Thap Fah – Phu Thep, (iii) Phetchabun, (iv) Nakon Sawan – Lobburi, and (v) Rayong – Chantaburi along the Loei Fold Belt (LFB), northeastern Thailand were studied. The LFB is a north–south trending 800 km fold belt that hosts several gold and base-metal deposits. The granitoids consist of monzogranite, granodiorite, monzodiorite, tonalite, quartz-syenite, and quartz-rich granitoids. These are composed of quartz, plagioclase, and K-feldspar with mafic minerals such as hornblende and biotite. Accessory minerals, such as titanite, zircon, magnetite, ilmenite, apatite, garnet, rutile, and allanite are also present. Magnetic susceptibilities in the SI unit of granitoids vary from 6.5 × 10−3 to 15.2 × 10−3 in Muang Loei, from 0.1 × 10−3 to 29.4 × 10−3 in Phu Thap Fah – Phu Thep, from 2.7 × 10−3 to 34.6 × 10−3 in Petchabun, from 2.4 × 10−3 to 14.1 × 10−3 in Nakon Sawan – Lobburi, and from 0.03 × 10−3 to 2.8 × 10−3 in Rayong – Chantaburi. Concentration of major elements suggests that these intermediate to felsic plutonic rocks have calc-alkaline affinities. Concentration of REE of the granitoids normalized to chondrite displays moderately elevated light REE (LREE) and relatively flat heavy (HREE) patterns, with distinct depletion of Eu. Rb versus Y/Nb and Nb/Y tectonic discrimination diagrams illustrate that the granitoids from Muang Loei, Phu Thap Fah – Phu Thep, Phetchabun, Nakon Sawan – Lobburi, and Rayong – Chantaburi formed in continental volcanic-arc setting. New age data from radiometric K-Ar dating on K-feldspar from granodiorite in Loei and Nakhon Sawan areas yielded 171 ± 3 and 221 ± 5 Ma, respectively. K-Ar dating on hornblende separated from diorite in Lobburi yielded 219 ± 8 Ma. These ages suggest that magmatism of Muang Loei occurred in the Middle Jurassic, and Nakon Sawan – Lobburi occurred in Late Triassic. Both Nb versus Y and Rb versus (Y + Nb) diagrams and age data indicate that Nakon Sawan – Lobburi granitoids intruded in Late Triassic at Nong Bua, Nakon Sawan province and Khao Wong Phra Jun, Lobburi province in volcanic arc setting. Muang Loei granitoids at the Loei province formed later in Middle Jurassic also in volcanic arc setting. The negative δ34SCDT values of ore minerals from the skarn deposit suggest that the I-type magma has been influenced by light biogenic sulfur from local country rocks. The Au-Cu-Fe-Sb deposits correlate with the magnetite-series granitoids in Phetchabun, Nakon Sawan – Lobburi and Rayong – Chantaburi areas. Metallogeny of the Au and Cu-Au skarn deposits and the epithermal Au deposit is related to adakitic rocks of magnetite-series granitoids from Phetchabun and Nakon Sawan areas. All mineralizations along the LFB are generated in the volcanic arc related to the subduction of Paleo-Tethys. The total Al (TAl) content of biotite of granitoids increases in the following order: granitoids associated with Fe and Au deposit < with Cu deposit < barren granitoids. XMg of biotite in granitoids in Muang Loei indicates the crystallization of biotite in magnetite-series granitoids under high oxygen fugacity conditions. On the other hand, low XMg (<0.4) of biotite in magnetite-series granitoids in Phu Thap Fah – Phu Thep and Rayong – Chantaburi indicates a reduced environment and low oxygen fugacity, associated with Au skarn deposit (Phu Thap Fah) and Sb-Au deposit (Bo Thong), respectively. The magnetite-series granitoids at Phu Thap Fah having low magnetic susceptibilities and low XMg of biotite were formed by reduction of initially oxidizing magnetite-series granitic magma by interaction with reducing sedimentary country rocks as suggested by negative δ34SCDT values."
"Evaluation of medical physics training in radiology residency in 67 countries  2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica MedicaPurpose: The main aim of medical physics training in radiology residency is to have appropriate and safer imaging of patients and safety of personnel. The need to have adequate coverage of medical physics and radiation safety in curricula of radiology residency is well perceived, but it is not known how far it is implemented in practice. Methods: We have analysed the data from 67 countries on medical physics teaching and assessment of residents in radiology programs, considering differences between countries in function of their human development index (HDI). Results: The results indicate that teaching of medical physics by radiologists rather than by medical physicists is very common and there is relationship with the developmental status of a country. The majority of countries with very high HDI used a written test (69%) for medical physics topics, often in combination with other subjects (63%). Further, there is lack of direct involvement of medical physicists during the examination phase of residents. Geographically, it can be seen that Latin American countries in particular lack involvement of medical physicists during both the teaching and examination phase. Conclusion: The lack of adequate involvement of medical physicists in training and in the formal examination of radiology residents in both developed and developing countries is a matter of concern with likely implications on patient and staff safety."
"Adsorption of propane and propylene in zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 pore: periodic SCC-DFTB method  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Adsorptions of propane and propylene in the ZIF-8 pore, were studied using periodic SCC-DFTB method. Six and eleven adsorption configurations for propane and propylene molecules in the ZIF-8 pore, were respectively found. The adsorption energies based on the most stable configurations of propane (− 1.38 kcal/mol) and propylene (− 1.25 kcal/mol) in the ZIF-8 pore were obtained. Due to adsorption abilities of the ZIF-8 pore which can adsorb propane better than propylene, the ZIF-8 therefore differentiate diffusion flux of propane and propylene via hexagonal aperture. These results agree with ability of the ZIF-8 pore to separate propane/propylene mixture based on the principle of gas–solid partition. All the adsorption configurations of propane and propylene molecules and their adsorption energies are reported. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Increasing Body Mass Index Steepens the Learning Curve for Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy  2018Objective: To define how the learning curve for success in ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is impacted by body mass index (BMI). Previous research has shown ultrasound-guided PCNL to be an effective method of nephrolithiasis treatment comparable to fluoroscopy-guided PCNL. A common concern for the ultrasound-guided approach is potential imaging difficulty in the obese patient population. Methods: A prospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing PCNL with ultrasound guidance for renal tract access was performed. Clinical data collected included success in gaining renal access with ultrasound guidance, patient BMI, and clinical outcomes over time. Nonparametric LOWESS regression modeling was performed in R using locally weighted scatterplot smoother (R version 3.3.3) for gradations of patients by BMI group (<30, 30-40, and >40). Results: A total of 150 cases were examined. Case number and BMI were evaluated as continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that BMI (P =.010; OR 0.93) and case number (P<.001; OR 1.03) were significantly correlated with ultrasound success. Sex, age, hydronephrosis, stone type, puncture location, and stone size did not influence success at obtaining ultrasound-only access in a statistically significant fashion. LOWESS regression modeling of the relationship between case number and renal access success depicts that the curve representative of the BMI >40 group is downward and right-shifted relative to the other two groups. Conclusion: The learning curve for successful ultrasound-guided PCNL is impacted by patient's BMI as well as case number. Increasing BMI makes access more challenging when performing ultrasound-guided PCNL."
"Efficacy of exogenous pyruvate in TremblerJ mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy  2018 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Introduction: Classic Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies including those with Schwann cell genetic defects exhibit a length-dependent process affecting the distal axon. Energy deprivation in the distal axon has been the proposed mechanism accounting for length-dependent distal axonal degeneration. We hypothesized that pyruvate, an intermediate glycolytic product, could restore nerve function, supplying lost energy to the distal axon. Methods: To test this possibility, we supplied pyruvate to the drinking water of the Trembler-J (TrJ) mouse and assessed efficacy based on histology, electrophysiology, and functional outcomes. Pyruvate outcomes were compared with untreated TrJ controls alone or adeno-associated virus mediated NT-3 gene therapy (AAV1.NT-3)/pyruvate combinatorial approach. Results: Pyruvate supplementation resulted increased myelinated fiber (MF) densities and myelin thickness in sciatic nerves. Combining pyruvate with proven efficacy from AAV1.tMCK.NT-3 gene therapy provided additional benefits showing improved compound muscle action potential amplitudes and nerve conduction velocities compared to pyruvate alone cohort. The end point motor performance of both the pyruvate and the combinatorial therapy cohorts was better than untreated TrJ controls. In a unilateral sciatic nerve crush paradigm, pyruvate supplementation improved myelin-based outcomes in both regenerating and the contralateral uncrushed nerves. Conclusions: This proof of principle study demonstrates that exogenous pyruvate alone or as adjunct therapy in TrJ may have clinical implications and is a candidate therapy for CMT neuropathies without known treatment."
"Increased Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction and Heart Failure in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases  2018 AGA InstituteBackground & Aims: There are conflicting data as to whether inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) increase risk for cardiovascular disease. We sought to examine the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure in patients with IBD. Methods: We identified patients diagnosed with IBD in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1980 through 2010 (n = 736). For each patient, 2 individuals without IBD (controls, n = 1472) were randomly selected, matched for age, sex, and index date of disease diagnosis. Primary outcomes were AMI and heart failure. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the risk of AMI and heart failure. Results: After adjustments for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, IBD associated independently with increased risk of AMI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.82; 95% CI, 1.98–4.04) and heart failure (aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.36–3.03). The relative risk of AMI was significantly increased in patients with Crohn's disease (aHR vs controls, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.65–5.13) or ulcerative colitis (aHR vs controls, 2.70; 1.69–4.35). The relative risk of AMI was increased among users of systemic corticosteroids (aHR vs controls, 5.08; 95% CI, 3.00–8.81) and nonusers (aHR vs controls, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.08–2.98). The relative risk of heart failure was significantly increased among patients with ulcerative colitis (aHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.18–3.65), but not Crohn's disease. The relative risk of heart failure was increased among users of systemic corticosteroids (aHR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.93–4.57), but not nonusers. Conclusions: In a population-based cohort study, we found that despite a lower prevalence of traditional risk factors for AMI and heart failure, patients with IBD are at increased risk for these cardiovascular disorders."
"External spermine prevents UVA-induced damage of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 via increased catalase activity and decreased H2O2 and malonaldehyde levels  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and the University of Milan.Common polyamines, putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), and spermine (Spm), are cationic compounds known as beneficial factors for many cellular processes including cell division, proliferation, differentiation, and stress response in all living organisms. Effects of exogenous Spm on the protective responses of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 exposed to UVA were investigated. The presence of 0.5 mM Spm in the culture medium significantly reduced cell growth after 60 min under white light condition but protected the cells after growing for 60 min under UVA. The stress-tolerant response of Synechocystis cells represented by the ratio of putrescine/spermidine (Put/Spd) showed about a 6-fold increase after 60 min UVA in the presence of Spm. In addition, those levels of chlorophyll a, carotenoids, and photosynthetic oxygen evolution were increased by Spm supplementation in UVA-treated cells. Exogenous Spm induced the activity of catalase but not superoxide dismutase in cells under UVA treatment. On the other hand, Spm treatment enabled cells to apparently decrease the intracellular free radical H2O2 and malonaldehyde (MDA) levels. Overall results suggested that Spm supplementation could protect Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells via the increase of Put/Spd ratio and the reduction of both H2O2 and MDA levels in conjunction with the induction of catalase activity. Interestingly, UVA-treated cells as compared to non-treated cells with exogenous Spm showed a decrease of Spm with an increase of Put and no change in Spd. This suggested the back conversion of Spm to Spd and finally to Put as cellular mechanism in response to UVA."
"Determination of selected emerging contaminants in freshwater invertebrates using a universal extraction technique and liquid chromatography accurate mass spectrometry  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA simple sample preparation method based on a modified liquid-phase extraction approach to extract selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products from freshwater organisms is described. Extracted samples were analysed using liquid chromatography with Q-Exactive plus hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry, using 2.6 μm C18 media. A 0.1% v/v acetic acid/acetonitrile mobile phase was applied over a 20 min gradient. Method detection limits in full scan mode were ca. 0.04–2.38 ng of analyte per g of sample. Linearity ranged from 0.9750 to 0.9996 over the calibration range of 0.01–100 μg/L; MS mass accuracy was <2 ppm for most analytes. This method was applied to quantify six pharmaceuticals and personal care products in seven invertebrate samples. For tandem mass spectrometry analysis, selection of precursor ions was performed for each pharmaceutical, with Mass Frontier software illustrating the fragmentation mechanism. Effects of collision energy on intensities of ions was further investigated. The tandem mass spectrometry condition resulting in the highest signal of respective selected product ion was selected to confirm each pharmaceutical, which was initially observed in the full scan mode. Results indicate that pharmaceuticals and personal care products found to be present in water-ways, may be incorporated into organisms that live in the environment of affected water streams."
"Response of the flood peak to the spatial distribution of rainfall in the Yom River basin, Thailand  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The response of the flood peak to the spatial distribution of rainfall has been reported in basins with nonuniform characteristics. However, prioritization of the influences of these characteristics is still poorly understood. This study evaluated the variability in the flood peak with the spatial distribution of rainfall at Sukhothai (city) in the Yom River basin, Thailand, and investigated the influence of the basin characteristics on the flood peak. For each of the 2-, 5- and 10-y rainfalls with durations of 24, 48 and 72 h, 1000 simulated rainfall events with various spatial distributions were generated according to the observed data by using a Monte Carlo analysis and Cholesky randomization. The floods from these rainfalls were then simulated, and the peak discharges were evaluated. The flood peaks from 24-h rainfalls were usually small but highly variable and could be extremely large when the rainfalls were concentrated over the mountainous region. The flood peaks from 48 to 72-h rainfalls were consistently large and correlated with the rainfalls over the joint area between the mountainous region and plain area. The basin characteristics that influenced the response of the flood peak to the spatial distribution of the rainfall appeared to depend on the rainfall duration and magnitude. For short-duration rainfalls, the response was mainly influenced by the surface storage when the rainfall was small and by the terrain steepness when the rainfall was large. For long-duration rainfalls, the response was mainly influenced by the soil percolation rate."
"Automated nucleated red blood cell count using the Mindray BC-6800 hematology analyzer  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: In current laboratory practice, obtaining a nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) count by manual microscopy (MM) is a laborious and time-consuming process. Modern hematology analyzers based on different technologies and methods have variable accuracies when determining NRBC counts. The aim of this study was to compare NRBC counts acquired by an automated Mindray BC-6800 analyzer (BC-6800), a flow cytometry (FC) reference method, and traditional MM. Methods: A hundred EDTA samples with initial NRBC flags from the BC-6800 were included. FC was used as a reference method to correlate the NRBC count with BC-6800 and MM counts. In addition, the performance of the Mindray SC-120 analyzer for preparing automated blood films for manual NRBC counting was compared to that of manually prepared blood films. Results: The NRBC counts obtained with the BC-6800 and MM vs the reference method were highly correlated (r =.994 and.989, respectively). However, the BC-6800 showed a lower bias than MM when compared with FC (0.3 × 109/L and −6.0 × 109/L, respectively). NRBC counts obtained using the automated Mindray SC-120 films were comparable to manually prepared films. Conclusion: The Mindray CAL8000 automated hematology system, which is composed of the BC-6800 and the SC-120, yields a precise NRBC count and can replace the traditional MM method for obtaining accurate and reproducible NRBC counts in high-value samples, such as patient monitoring samples used to determine the necessity of transfusion therapy in thalassemia patients. Moreover, this method offers several advantages, including a faster turnaround time, labor savings, and cost effectiveness."
"Effects of iron content on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of Ti-30Zr-5Al-3V-xFe alloys  2018The microstructure and corrosion behavior of the hot-rolled Ti-30Zr-5Al-3V-xFe alloys were investigated. All the alloys are composed of α and β phases. With the increase of Fe content, α laths gradually decreases and the relative content of β phase increases. Potentiodynamic polarization curves recorded in 3.5% NaCl and 5% HCl solutions show that all the alloys exhibit a passivation behavior at potential in the range of 0.25–1.25 V (SCE). An evident change in corrosion current density is presented for all of the alloys in both solutions, which can be attributed to the passive film breakdown caused by pitting corrosion. All the alloys exhibit more positive pitting potential compared with the typical 304 stainless steel. The impedance spectra were fitted using equivalent circuit with two time constants. The alloys with different Fe contents exhibit capacitive behavior with phase angles closed to −80° and high impedance values at low frequency. Containing Fe alloys exhibit commendable combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which is markedly superior to the typical 304 stainless steel although the corrosion resistance decreases by the addition of Fe. The relative content of α and β phases and the segregations of Fe and V elements are identified as the main factors that affect the corrosion resistance of the hot-rolled alloys."
"Effect of transition metal dopants (M= Nb, La, Zr, and Y) on the M-TiO2 supported V2O5 catalysts in the selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur  2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.P-25 TiO2 was modified by a small amount addition of different transition metal dopants (Nb, La, Zr, and Y) and employed as the supports for preparation of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts for the selective H2S oxidation at low temperature (130 °C). The H2S removal capability was ranged in the order: V2O5/Y-TiO2 > V2O5/Zr-TiO2 V2O5/TiO2 > V2O5/La-TiO2 > V2O5/Nb-TiO2, which corresponded well to the chemically adsorbed oxygen on oxygen vacancies at catalyst surface (or surface oxygen) as revealed by XPS results. The Y addition could promote the oxygen vacancies formation because of the Ti4+ substitution by less valence Y3+ cations, leading to the improvement of H2S conversion. Whereas the modification by dopants, which have the extra valence cations or larger ionic radius (i.e., Nb or La) suppressed the oxygen vacancies formation, thus leading to lower activity. Despite the stronger interaction between V and Zr-TiO2, the amount of surface oxygen and H2S conversion of the V2O5/Zr-TiO2 were less than the V2O5/Y-TiO2, suggesting that although the formation of oxygen vacancies depended on the interaction between V and M-TiO2, the effect of Ti4+ substitution by transition metal dopant was more pronounced than the degree of interaction between V and M-TiO2. The H2S removal capability corresponded well to the oxygen vacancies being formed more than the degree of interaction between V and M-TiO2. From this study, the V2O5/Y-TiO2 showed the highest H2S conversion at ∼77% with low SO2 formation (less than 10 ppm)."
"Effects of H1 antihistamine addition to intranasal corticosteroid for allergic rhinitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis  2018 ARS-AAOA, LLCBackground: A combination of H1 antihistamine (AH) with intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) is commonly prescribed to patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) who have an inadequate response to monotherapy. In this systematic review we aimed to determine the effects of AH combined with INCS (AH-INCS) for treating AR. Methods: Literature searches were performed using Medline and Embase. Randomized, controlled trials that studied the effects of AH-INCS vs INCS monotherapy for treating patients with AR were included. The primary outcomes were total nasal symptom scores, total ocular symptom scores, and disease-specific quality of life. The secondary outcomes were objective tests for nasal patency and adverse events. Results: Sixteen studies (4026 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Compared with INCS, AH-INCS decreased total nasal symptom scores (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.19 to −0.06; p < 0.001; 10 trials, 3348 patients) and total ocular symptom scores (SMD, −0.12, 95% CI, −0.20 to −0.04; p = 0.003; 6 trials, 2378 patients). Subgroup analysis indicated no benefit with the oral AH-INCS combination but did show benefit with intranasal AH-INCS (SMD, −0.18; 95% CI, −0.27 to −0.09; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences with regard to disease-specific quality of life (SMD, −0.07; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.02; p = 0.12; 6 trials, 1981 patients), nasal inspiratory flow (MD, −0.03 L/min; 95% CI, −0.57 to 0.50; p = 0.91; 1 trial, 54 patients), or adverse events. Conclusion: Intranasal AH-INCS has benefit over INCS on nasal and ocular symptom improvement for treating AR. Oral AH-INCS is not recommended."
"Consensus and contentious statements on the use of probiotics in clinical practice: A south east Asian gastro-neuro motility association working team report  2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdThe concept of consuming microorganisms in the treatment of a medical condition and in health maintenance has gained much attraction, giving rise to an abundance of medical claims and of health supplements. This study identified relevant clinical questions on the therapeutic use of probiotics and reviewed the literature in irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, impaired intestinal immunity, liver disease, intestinal infections, and common childhood digestive disorders. Statements were developed to address these clinical questions. A panel of experienced clinicians was tasked to critically evaluate and debate the available data. Both consensus and contentious statements are presented to provide to clinicians a perspective on the potential of probiotics and importantly their limitations."
"Gradient Directional Second Derivative Pseudo-enhancement Correction and Modified Local Roughness Response Estimation for Electronic Cleansing in CT Colonography  2018, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.This paper proposes the gradient directional second derivative pseudo-enhancement (PEH) correction method to reduce the computed tomography (CT) attenuations of PEH soft-tissue voxels around fecal-tagging material (FTM) in CT colo-nography and the modified local roughness response estimation, which can efficiently separate air-tagging (AT) layers from air-tissue-tagging (ATT) layers. By integrating these two proposed methods into electronic colon cleansing (ECC), FTM can be effectively removed by a simple thresholding method. For subjective or clinical evaluation, a radiologist grades the quality of cleansing based on five causes of low quality cleansing. The average grade of our proposed method for clinical evaluation is 2.5714 out of 4. For objective evaluations, three cases exist: PEH correction, ECC, and visual assessment. First, PEH correction evaluation measures the success in the removal of PEH voxels with CT attenuations greater than or equal to 500 HU using the proposed PEH correction by comparing the results of this correction with the results from the existing method via CT attenuation profiles. Second, ECC is evaluated by comparing the results from applying our proposed methods with the ground truth. The results indicate that the goodness of cleansing is 0.01% and the global mean relative error is less than 0.016% with 99.99% confidence. Third, visual assessment of our ECC results confirms that soft-tissue components around FTM, especially ATT layers, are preserved."
"Evapotranspiration and water yield of a pine-broadleaf forest are not altered by long-term atmospheric [CO2] enrichment under native or enhanced soil fertility  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdChanges in evapotranspiration (ET) from terrestrial ecosystems affect their water yield (WY), with considerable ecological and economic consequences. Increases in surface runoff observed over the past century have been attributed to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations resulting in reduced ET by terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we evaluate the water balance of a Pinus taeda (L.) forest with a broadleaf component that was exposed to atmospheric [CO2] enrichment (ECO2; +200 ppm) for over 17 years and fertilization for 6 years, monitored with hundreds of environmental and sap flux sensors on a half-hourly basis. These measurements were synthesized using a one-dimensional Richard's equation model to evaluate treatment differences in transpiration (T), evaporation (E), ET, and WY. We found that ECO2 did not create significant differences in stand T, ET, or WY under either native or enhanced soil fertility, despite a 20% and 13% increase in leaf area index, respectively. While T, ET, and WY responded to fertilization, this response was weak (<3% of mean annual precipitation). Likewise, while E responded to ECO2 in the first 7 years of the study, this effect was of negligible magnitude (<1% mean annual precipitation). Given the global range of conifers similar to P. taeda, our results imply that recent observations of increased global streamflow cannot be attributed to decreases in ET across all ecosystems, demonstrating a great need for model–data synthesis activities to incorporate our current understanding of terrestrial vegetation in global water cycle models."
"Effect of Oil Palm Fiber Content on the Physical and Mechanical Properties and Microstructure of High-Calcium Fly Ash Geopolymer Paste  2018, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.This paper investigates the effect of oil palm fiber content on the physical and mechanical properties and microstructure of high-calcium fly ash geopolymer paste. The oil palm fiber was added to the mixture at 0, 1, 2, and 3% by weight of fly ash. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na 2SiO 3) were used as liquid alkaline activators. The bulk density, compressive strength, flexural strength, pore size distribution, scanning electron microscopy, and thermal conductivity of geopolymer paste were determined. Test results showed that the bulk density of high-calcium geopolymer paste containing oil palm fibers decreased with increasing fiber content. The increase oil palm fiber content decreased the compressive strength of geopolymer paste but enhanced the flexural strength and toughness and changed the failure behavior of geopolymer composite. In addition, the pore size and total porosity also increased with the increase in fiber content, while the thermal conductivity was reduced. The addition of oil palm fiber can improve the flexural strength and thermal conductivity of geopolymer paste and could thus be developed into a fiber-reinforced composite for construction purposes."
"The presence of duck Tembusu virus in Thailand since 2007: A retrospective study  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbHDuck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), a newly emerging virus in ducks, was first reported in China in 2010. However, an unknown severe contagious disease associated with severe neurological signs and egg production losses in ducks, resembling to DTMUV infection, was observed in Thailand since 2007. To determine the presence of DTMUV in 2007, the clinical samples from affected ducks collected in 2007 were tested for DTMUV using pathological and virological analyses. Gross and histopathological lesions of affected ducks were mostly restricted to the ovary, brain and spinal cord, and correlated with the presence of flavivirus antigen in the brain and spinal cord samples. Subsequently, DTMUV was identified by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the polyprotein gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the polyprotein gene sequence revealed that the 2007 Thai DTMUV was a unique virus, belonged within DTMUV cluster 1, but distinctively separated from the Malaysian DTMUV, which was the most closely related DTMUV. It is interesting to note that the 2007 Thai DTMUV was genetically different from the currently circulating Thai and Chinese DTMUVs, which belonged to cluster 2. Our findings indicated that the 2007 Thai DTMUV emerged earlier from a common ancestor with the recently reported DTMUVs; however, it was genetically distinctive to any of the currently circulating DTMUVs. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the presence of DTMUV in the Thai ducks since 2007, prior to the first report of DTMUV in China in 2010. This study indicates that DTMUV may have circulated in the region long before 2010 and highlights high genetic diversity of DTMUVs in Asia."
"Detection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) E2 and Erns antibody (IgG, IgA) in oral fluid specimens from inoculated (ALD strain) or vaccinated (LOM strain) pigs  2018 Elsevier B.V.The objective of this study was to describe oral fluid and serum antibody (IgG, IgA) responses against classical swine fever virus (CSFV) E2 and Erns proteins in pigs (n = 60) inoculated with a moderately virulent field strain (ALD, n = 30) or a modified live virus vaccine strain (LOM, n = 30). Oral fluid (n = 1391) and serum (n = 591) samples were collected from individually-housed pigs between day post inoculation (DPI) −14 to 28. Testing revealed the synchronous appearance of E2- and Erns-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in serum and oral fluids over time, with E2 and Erns IgG ELISAs providing better diagnostic performance than the IgA ELISAs. Overall the data suggest the feasibility of large-scale, cost-effective screening of populations for CSFV using oral fluid samples. Given the historic issues of cross-reactivity among pestiviruses, future research should focus on the development of CSFV-specific testing platforms for the detection of E2 and/or Erns IgG in oral fluid, ideally to be used in combination with DIVA vaccines."
"Psychometric properties of the modified Yale food addiction scale 2.0 in a large Brazilian sample  2018, Associacao Brasileira de Psiquiatria. All rights reserved.Objective: The field of food addiction has attracted growing research attention. The modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS 2.0) is a screening tool based on DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorders. However, there is no validated instrument to assess food addiction. Methods: The mYFAS 2.0 has been transculturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. The data for this study was obtained through an anonymous web-based research platform: participants provided sociodemographic data and answered Brazilian versions of the the mYFAS 2.0 and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11). Analysis included an assessment of the Brazilian mYFAS 2.0’s internal consistency reliability, factor structure, and convergent validity in relation to BIS-11 scores. Results: Overall, 7,639 participants were included (71.3% females; age: 27.2±7.9 years). The Brazilian mYFAS 2.0 had adequate internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89). A single factor solution yielded the best goodness-of-fit parameters for both the continuous and categorical version of the mYFAS 2.0 in confirmatory factor analysis. In addition, mYFAS 2.0 correlated with BIS-11 total scores (Spearman’s rho = 0.26, p < 0.001) and subscores. Conclusion: The Brazilian mYFAS 2.0 demonstrated adequate psychometric properties in our sample; however, future studies should further evaluate its discriminant validity."
"Cyanidin-3-rutinoside alleviates methylglyoxal-induced cardiovascular abnormalities in the rats  2018 Elsevier LtdWe investigated the effect of cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R) against methylglyoxal (MG)-advanced glycation end products (AGEs) mediated cardio-vascular abnormalities in rats pre-treated with MG. In the rats, plasma MG level rose following oral administration of MG (60–120 mg/rat/day) for 8 weeks and was accompanied by a buildup of MG-derived AGE, Nɛ-(carboxymethyl) lysine, in aortic tissue both of which were decreased by co-treatment with C3R (30 and 100 mg/kg/day). Similarly, MG-impaired vascular contraction/relaxation responses were normalized by C3R with concomitant upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression. In the whole animal subjected to coronary artery ligation, C3R (100 mg/kg/day) reduced ventricular extra beats and ventricular tachycardia precipitated during acute ischemic episode. We suggest that C3R reduces the formation and accumulation of AGEs via direct trapping of the MG and upregulation of mRNA expression of glyoxalase I. The findings implicate C3R as a candidate compound for preventing MG-AGE mediated cardiovascular abnormalities in diabetes."
"Risk assessment of arsenic from contaminated soils to shallow groundwater in Ong Phra Sub-District, Suphan Buri Province, Thailand  2018 The AuthorsStudy region: The Arsenic (As) concentrations found in Ong Phra sub-district, Dan Chang district, and Suphan Buri province are approx. 20 times higher than the average concentration of As in agricultural soils of Thailand. Study focus: The objectives of this current study were to investigate the As contamination in soil and groundwater and further develop the risk assessment map of As from contaminated soils releasing to shallow groundwater by combining DRASTIC method with contamination factor (CF) and mobility factor (MF). New hydrological insights for the region: According to the sequential extraction result, the concentrations of total As in 39 soil samples ranges from 4.8 to 1070.4 mg/kg. The highest As concentration in shallow groundwater was found at well number 3, located within <0.5 km. downstream from the old tin mine. The Index of DRASTIC groundwater vulnerability, is in the range of 59–147, which is categorized into three vulnerability zones as follows: low (<100), moderate (100–130) and high (>130). The high vulnerability area, found along the waterway, is approximately 35 km2 (18.65% of the study area). Interestingly, the DRASTIC index of the old tin mine is indicated as the zone of moderate and high vulnerability. The findings in this study reveal that the integration of the DRASTIC risk map with CF can well elucidate As contaminated in shallow groundwater."
"Sex difference in cold perception and shivering onset upon gradual cold exposure  2018To maintain a thermal balance when experiencing cold, humans reduce heat loss and enhance heat production. A potent and rapid mechanism for heat generation is shivering. Research has shown that women prefer a warmer environment and feel less comfortable than men in the same thermal condition. Using the Blanketrol® III, a temperature management device commonly used to study brown adipose tissue activity, we tested whether the experimental temperature (TE) at which men and women start to shiver differs. Twenty male and 23 female volunteers underwent a cooling protocol, starting at 24 °C and gradually decreasing by 1–2 °C every 5 min until an electromyogram detected the shivering or the temperature reached 9 °C. Women started shivering at a higher TE than men (11.3 ± 1.8 °C for women vs 9.6 ± 1.8 °C for men, P = 0.003). In addition, women felt cool, scored by a visual analogue scale, at a higher TE than men (18.3 ± 3.0 °C for women vs 14.6 ± 2.6 °C for men, P < 0.001). This study demonstrates a sex difference in response to cold exposure: women require shivering as a source of heat production earlier than men. This difference could be important and sex should be considered when using cooling protocols in physiological studies."
"Xanthones and biphenyls from the stems of Garcinia cylindrocarpa and their cytotoxicity  2018Six new compounds including four new xanthones, cylindroxanthones D–G (1–4), and two new biphenyls, cylindrobiphenyls A and B (5 and 6), were isolated from the stems of Garcinia cylindrocarpa together with 28 known compounds (7–34). The structures of the new compounds were established on the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS spectroscopic analysis. Their cytotoxicity was evaluated against five human cancer cell lines including KB, HeLa S-3, MCF-7, Hep G2, and HT-29. Compound 23 showed strong cytotoxicity against KB, HeLa S-3, MCF-7, and Hep G2 cells with IC50 values in the range of 2.20–6.00 μM. Furthermore, compound 25 selectively exhibited good cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells with IC50 value of 8.77 μM, while 31 showed good cytotoxicity against HT-29 cells with IC50 value of 9.18 μM."
"Results of PROFILE 1029, a Phase III Comparison of First-Line Crizotinib versus Chemotherapy in East Asian Patients with ALK-Positive Advanced Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer  2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Introduction: The phase III randomized PROFILE 1014 study demonstrated superiority of crizotinib to first-line chemotherapy in prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated patients with ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK)-positive advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. This result was consistent with that in the smaller subset of East Asian patients in PROFILE 1014. The subsequent study reported here prospectively evaluated crizotinib in a larger East Asian patient population. Methods: In this open-label phase III study (PROFILE 1029), patients were randomized 1:1 to receive orally administered crizotinib 250 mg twice daily continuously (3-week cycles) or intravenously administered chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 , plus cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 , or carboplatin [at a dose to produce area under the concentration–time curve of 5–6 mg·min/mL]) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. PFS confirmed by independent radiology review was the primary end point. Results: Crizotinib significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio, 0.402; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.286–0.565; p < 0.001). The median PFS was 11.1 months with crizotinib and 6.8 months with chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 87.5% (95% CI: 79.6–93.2%) with crizotinib versus 45.6% (95% CI: 35.8–55.7%) with chemotherapy (p < 0.001). The most common adverse events were increased transaminase levels, diarrhea, and vision disorders with crizotinib and leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia with chemotherapy. Significantly greater improvements from baseline in patient-reported outcomes were seen in crizotinib-treated versus chemotherapy-treated patients. Conclusions: First-line crizotinib significantly improved PFS, objective response rate, and patient-reported outcomes compared with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in East Asian patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, which is similar to the results from PROFILE 1014. The safety profiles of crizotinib and chemotherapy were consistent with those previously published."
"Improved measurements of thoron (220Rn) in natural waters  2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.Thoron (220Rn) in water measurements can be useful for prospecting for points of submarine groundwater discharge into surface waters. With a 56 s half-life any detection of thoron must mean that one is close to a source. To improve measurement sensitivity, the influence of airflow rates on both radon and thoron measurements have been investigated using a RAD7 detector. Based on lab experiments, 2.5 L min−1 represents an optimum airflow rate for measuring both radon and thoron. Field data from a coastal zone demonstrates that use of an external air pump produced a thoron response 65% higher than a standard setup."
"Comparative study in physico-chemical properties of gelatin derivatives and their microspheres as carriers for controlled release of green tea's extract  2018 Elsevier B.V.Two types of gelatin derivatives were prepared from type A and type B gelatin, respectively. Cationized gelatin was produced by conjugation of ethylenediamine into type A gelatin using carbodiimide reaction. Anionized gelatin was produced by conjugation of succinic anhydride to type B gelatin. Characteristics of four gelatin types and their microspheres fabricated by water-in-oil emulsion and glutaraldehyde crosslinking were evaluated. Cationized gelatin showed the highest positive charge and free amino group concentration due to the ethylenediamine conjugation, resulting in the highest crosslinking percentage and slowest degradation rate of cationized gelatin microspheres. Type A, B and anionized gelatin which had lower concentration of free amino groups produced the low crosslinking and fast-degrading microspheres. These gelatin microspheres were introduced as carrier for controlled release of epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), a high antioxidant green tea's extract. The cationized gelatin microspheres showed prolonged release of EGCG due to the slow degradation and ionic attraction with the negative-charged EGCG. The release of EGCG from type A, B and anionized gelatin microspheres was accelerated as a result of diffusion and microsphere's swelling mechanisms. These EGCG-loaded gelatin microspheres can be further studied as injectable drug for localized treatment of inflammation-related diseases with minimal invasion."
"VDR and TNFSF11 polymorphisms are associated with osteoporosis in thai patients  2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.Determining molecular markers for osteoporosis may be valuable for improving the quality of life of affected elderly patients by aiding in early detection and disease management. In the present study, the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and tumour necrosis factor superfamily number 11 (TNFSF11) genes and the susceptibility of developing osteoporosis was investigated in a Thai female cohort. The study group consisted of 105 Thai postmenopausal patients diagnosed with osteoporosis and 132 healthy Thai postmenopausal female volunteers. DNA extracted from blood samples was used to genotype the VDR and TNFSF11 genes using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing analysis. For VDR, the frequencies of the genotypes TT, CT and CC for the TaqI SNP (rs731236) were 87.88, 11.36 and 0.76%, respectively, in the control group, while in the osteoporosis cohort were 92.38, 5.71 and 1.91%, respectively. For the FokI SNP (rs2228570), the frequencies of the genotypes CC, CT and TT were 31.06, 55.30 and 13.64%, respectively, in the control group, and in the osteoporosis group were 29.52, 43.81 and 26.67%, respectively. For BsmI SNP (rs1544410), the frequencies of the genotypes GG, GA and AA were 78.03, 18.94 and 3.03%, respectively, in control group, and in the osteoporosis group were 80.95, 18.10 and 0.95%, respectively. The significant risk of osteoporosis associated with the FokI SNP was determined. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 2.30 (1.14 4.69; P=0.01) among patients with osteoporosis with TT as the susceptibility genotype. For TNFSF11, the frequencies of the genotypes TT, CT and CC for the 290C>T SNP (rs9525641) in the control group were 36.36, 50.76 and 12.88%, respectively, while in the osteoporosis group were 31.43, 56.19 and 12.38%, respectively. For the 643C>T SNP (rs9533156), the frequencies of the genotypes TT, CT and CC in the control group were 35.61, 48.48 and 15.91%, respectively, while in the osteoporosis group were 32.38, 55.24 and 12.38%, respectively. For the 693G>C SNP (rs9533155), the frequencies of the genotypes CC, CG, and GG in the control group were 39.39, 46.97 and 13.64%, respectively, and in the osteoporosis group were 36.19, 53.33 and 10.48%, respectively. No significant associations of the TNFSF11 SNPs with osteoporosis were determined; however, it was notable that the GCT haplotype of TNFSF11 may be a protective haplotype for osteoporosis. Therefore, it was concluded that the SNP FokI of VDR may be a potential molecular biomarker for the development of osteoporosis in Thai females."
"The inclusion complexation of daidzein with β-cyclodextrin and 2,6-dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin: a theoretical and experimental study  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: Daidzein is an isoflavone of the group of phytoestrogens extracted from soybeans and other legumes. As its structure is relatively similar to that of the hormone estrogen, daidzein is able to bind with estrogen receptors leading to a reduced postmenopausal women symptom. A common problem of the compounds of this group is the rather low water solubility with the consequence of limited pharmaceutical applications. Inclusion complexation between daidzein and two β-CDs (β-CD and DM-β-CD) was investigated by theoretical and experimental techniques. Based on multiple MD simulations in combination with different binding-free energy calculations, the most preferential mode of daidzein binding to cyclodextrins is the insertion of the chromone ring fitting well into the hydrophobic cavity. All four methods of binding-free energy calculations (MM/PBSA, MM/GBSA, QM/PBSA, and QM/GBSA) predict the binding affinity of the daidzein/DM-β-CD complex significantly higher than the daidzein/β-CD. Following the same trend, the experimental results also indicated the enhancement of solubility and stability of the daidzein/DM-β-CD complex. Moreover, it was found that the complexation process was favorably enthalpy driven. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Higher Hydrocarbons Synthesis from CO2 Hydrogenation Over K- and La-Promoted Fe–Cu/TiO2 Catalysts  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: Developing selective and active catalyst is critical for CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons especially C5+ products. The present work reports on the significant promoting effects of K and La addition to Fe–Cu/TiO2 catalyst on higher hydrocarbon production from CO2 hydrogenation. The incorporation of both K and La promoters can improve both CO2 hydrogenation activity and selectivity to higher hydrocarbons of Fe-based catalyst. Characterization by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) showed that the presence of K promoter significantly decreased the adsorption of H2, which suppressed the CH4 formation. On the other hand, La addition can promote the moderately adsorbed CO2 species (mainly monodentate carbonate species), which leads to the enhanced C5–C7 selectivity. The simultaneous use of promoters La and K can tailor the H and C coverage on the catalyst surface, which plays an important role in altering product distribution in CO2 hydrogenation.

"Treatment with chemical delipidation forskolin prior to cryopreservation improves the survival rates of swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and bovine (Bos indicus) in vitro produced embryos  2018 Elsevier Inc.The cryopreservation of embryos is a technology developed for long-term genetic preservation. However, high sensitivity to low temperatures due to a large number of intracellular lipids within ruminant embryos compromises the success of this technique. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of using of lipolytic chemical agent forskolin, during in vitro producing of buffalo and bovine embryos on lipid contents, cryotolerance and subsequent developmental competence of these embryos. Buffalo and bovine oocytes were collected by the aspiration technique from follicles and submitted for in vitro fertilisation; the embryos were later divided into four experiments. Experiment 1, buffalo and bovine embryos were pre-treated in the presence and absence of 10 μM forskolin for 24 h. Lipid contents were determined by Nile red staining and confocal microscopy. We found that 10 μM forskolin was capable to reduce lipid contents within developing embryos in both of species (P < 0.01). Lipid contents within Day 2 embryos exhibited greater fluorescence intensity than did Day 7 embryos in both animal species. The purpose of Experiment 2 was to investigate the adverse effects of 10 μM forskolin on embryo development. In Experiments 3 and 4, Day 2 (4- to 8-cell stage) and Day 7 (blastocyst stage) embryos were pre-treated with 10 μM forskolin for 24 h and further cryopreserved with a controlled-rate freezing technique. The successful cryopreservation was determined by post-thawed embryonic development in vitro. The results showed that the blastocyst rate of the 4–8 cell stage in the forskolin-treated group had increased in both species, while the hatching and hatched blastocyst rates of forskolin-treated day 7 bovine embryos were significantly higher than those of the non-treated group (52.1% vs. 39.4%; P < 0.05). However, delipidation with forskolin did not affect the developmental rate of the day 7 buffalo embryos (P = 0.73). Our studies showed that delipidation by forskolin treatment increased the survival rate of cryopreservation in buffalo and bovine in vitro produced embryos."
"Green synthesis of titanium dioxide/acrylamide-based hydrogel composite, self degradation and environmental applications  2018 Elsevier LtdA green polymerization using TiO2 as an inorganic photoinitiator to synthesize titanium dioxide/poly[acrylamide-co-(acrylic acid)] hydrogel composite was successfully achieved. FTIR and SEM/EDXS characterizations indicated that the hydrogel composites were the crosslinked copolymer composed of acrylamide and acrylic acid in TiO2 particles. TiO2 hydrogel composites could adsorb up to 90% of 5 ppm methylene blue dye solution. Decolorization of methylene blue by the hydrogel composites was evaluated by colorimetry in term of K/S value. Approximately 83% of methylene blue was decolorized in 8 h by 5% TiO2 hydrogel composite and 90% decolorization in 8 h for 10% TiO2 hydrogel composites. The maximum color fading of methylene blue in the hydrogel composites at various UV irradiation times was observed by the slope of the linear region at different amounts of TiO2. It reveals that AMAA5050T10C1 gave the highest methylene blue fading of 91.6% with an R2 of 0.9999. The slope of 5 ppm Congo red in AM-T20-C1 adsorbent obeying a Pseudo-first order gave the highest dye removal of 44.8% with an R2 of 0.9572. This technique meets the criteria of green chemistry because the reaction does not need any organic photoinitiator or co-photoinitiator and the reaction takes place at room temperature. Congo red in polyacrylamide hydrogel composite containing 20% TiO2 obeyed a Pseudo-first order kinetics giving qe,exp = 2.22 mg g−1 (qe,cal = 2.24 mg g−1) while methylene blue in poly[acrylamide-co-(acrylic acid)] hydrogel composite at 50:50 monomer weight ratio containing 5% TiO2 followed a Pseudo-second order kinetics having qe,exp = 4.86 mg g−1 (qe,cal = 4.73 mg g−1). The rheological measurement of the TiO2/poly[arylamide-co-(acrylic acid)] hydrogel composites revealed a strong gel-like material and the self-degradation of the hydrogel composites evolved under UVA irradiation. TiO2/poly[(acrylamide)-co-(acrylic acid)] hydrogel composites synthesized in current work can be used as a model for both green synthesis of the hydrogel composites using an ionic photocatalyst, TiO2, and for degradation of organic dyes and self-degradation of the composites upon UV irradiation."
"Catalytic hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters over Pd supported on Zr-SBA-15 with various Zr loading levels for enhanced oxidative stability  2018 Elsevier B.V.Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil (SO)-derived biodiesel, as fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), over mesoporous palladium (Pd)/SBA-15 materials was examined in a semi-batch reactor. The amount of Pd/SBA-15 catalyst was varied from 0.5–1% by weight (wt%) of the SO feedstock. The selectivity of saturated FAMEs (C18:0), which contribute to an excellent oxidative stability but undesirable cold flow properties, over the Pd/SBA-15 catalyst at different wt% was poor after a 4-h reaction period. To improve the catalytic performance, zirconium (Zr) species were incorporated in the SBA-15, resulting in Zr-SBA-15 with tunable acidity and pore properties. Partial hydrogenation of SO-FAME over 0.75 wt% Pd/xZr-SBA-15 catalysts (where x is the Zr/silicon (Si) molar ratio and ranged from 0.01 to 0.11) was performed for 2 h. The catalytic performance and the selectivity towards trans-monounsaturated FAMEs (trans-C18:1), in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) and trans-C18:1/cis-C18:1 ratio, respectively, were considered at 10% and 80% conversion levels of diunsaturated FAMEs (C18:2). The incorporation of Zr into SBA-15 resulted in an enhanced TOF due to the greater adsorption of both H2 and the basic double bonds of FAME molecules on the electron-deficient catalyst surfaces. The TOF for the Pd/xZr-SBA-15 catalysts increased as the Zr/Si molar ratio increased up to 0.07, and then slightly dropped at higher Zr/Si molar ratios, presumably due to the hindrance of adsorbed-reacted FAME molecules with strong adsorption and the worsening of physical properties, i.e. pore width (DP). The selectivity towards trans-C18:1 was directly correlated with the Zr/Si molar ratio. Since the strong adsorption of FAME molecules took place on the catalyst surface, the high level of trans-C18:1 was consequently generated. The oxidative stability of the partially hydrogenated biodiesels was improved by more than four-fold compared to that of the starting SO-FAMEs."
"Universal models of colour emotion and colour harmony  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.A new set of quantitative models of colour emotion and colour harmony were developed in this study using psychophysical data collected from 12 regions in the world, including Argentina, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Iran, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, and the UK. These data have previously been published in journals or conferences (for details see Tables and). For colour emotion, three new models were derived, showing satisfactory predictive performance in terms of an average correlation coefficient of 0.78 for “warm/cool”, 0.80 for “heavy/light” and 0.81 for “active/passive”. The new colour harmony model also had satisfactory predictive performance, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.72. Principal component analysis shows that the common colour harmony principles, including hue similarity, chroma similarity, lightness difference and high lightness principles, were partly agreed by observers of the same region. The findings suggest that it is feasible to develop universal models of colour emotion and colour harmony, and that the former was found to be relatively more culture-independent than the latter."
"Effect of Surface Tungstate W5+ Species on the Metathesis Activity of W-Doped Spherical Silica Catalysts  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The high surface area W-doped spherical silica (SSP) catalysts were prepared with different sequences of W and Si addition (W–Si(Alt), Si1–W2, and W1–Si2) by the sol–gel method with CTAB as a structure directing agent and compared with the impregnated one (W/SSP). All the catalysts exhibited high specific surface area (∼ 1100 m2 g−1) with a closely perfect spherical shape. The presence of surface/sub-surface tungstate W5+ species, crystalline bulk WO3, and tetrahedral tungsten oxide species on the prepared catalysts was investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profile analysis, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Without in situ reduction by the reactants/products, tungstate W5+ species was found on the top surface of the as-prepared W–Si(Alt) whereas for the Si1–W2, W/SSP, and W1–Si2, the W5+ appeared only on the sub-surface of the catalysts after 5 and 15 s Ar+ etching. The abundance of surface W5+ species is suggested to facilitate the establishment of the active tungsten carbenes and was correlated well to the catalytic activity in propene metathesis. The surface W5+-activity relationship of the WO3-based metathesis catalysts is useful especially when the catalyst activity did not depend solely on the amount of active tetrahedral coordinated tungsten oxides."
"High-resolution melting analysis: A novel approach for clade differentiation in Pythium insidiosum and pythiosis  The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology.Pythium insidiosum causes life-threatening human pythiosis. Based on phylogenetic analysis using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase II (COX2) gene, intergenic spacer (IGS) region and exo-1,3-β-glucanase gene (exo1), P. insidiosum is classified into clade A TH, B TH, and C TH related to geographic distribution. At present, polymerase chain reaction in any of these specific regions with DNA sequencing is the only technique to provide clade diagnosis. In this study, P. insidiosum-specific primers targeting COX2 gene were designed and used in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with subsequent high-resolution melting (HRM) to provide rapid identification as well as clade classification for P. insidiosum. Based on the qPCR-HRM method, 15 P. insidiosum isolates could be differentiated from 28 related organisms with 100% specificity and 1 pg limit of detection. This technique was, in addition, directly tested on clinical samples from proved human pythiosis cases: nine corneal scrapes and six arterial clots. The qPCR-HRM results of all nine corneal samples were a 100% match with the results from the conventional PCR at clade level. However, the qPCR-HRM results of arterial clot samples were only matched with the nucleotide sequencing results from the conventional PCR at species level. In conclusion, the qPCR-HRM is a simple one closed tube, inexpensive and user-friendly method to identify P. insidiosum into clade level."
"An investigation of saturated vapor pressure regarding low-volatility organophosphorus extractants Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid and tributyl phosphate: Correlation and thermodynamics study  2018 Elsevier LtdNew saturated vapor pressure (psat) data of organophosphorus extractants, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and tributyl phosphate (TBP), were investigated in T = (383.8–546.2) K and psat = (0.13–6.67) kPa using vacuum distillation method. The data was found to be a good fit with Antoine, August, Riedel and Wagner equation. Regression constants prove to be very useful in estimating psat at operating temperature. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding affected D2EHPA having lower psat in comparison with TBP. Thermodynamic properties of both molar enthalpy and molar entropy of vaporization were obtained using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. As temperature increased, molar enthalpy and molar entropy of vaporization decreased showing a positive deviation from Trouton's rule. Using the relations of molar enthalpy and temperature, saturated liquid heat capacity was obtained. All data can be usefully employed for the design of a distillation column or evaporator for recycling of both extractants from organic wastewater."
"Immunohistochemical study of Ki-67 protein, androgen receptor, and estrogen receptor beta in testicular tissues of male pigs immunocastrated with different times of GnRH vaccination  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbHThis study aimed to investigate the immunoexpression of Ki-67 protein, androgen receptor (AR), and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) in testicular tissues of male pigs immunocastrated using GnRH vaccine (Improvac™, Zoetis Co., Ltd., Thailand) with different times. Totally, 30 male pigs were classified by castration protocol into three groups: T1 (n = 10) consisted of pigs immunocastrated at 14 and 18 weeks of age, T2 (n = 10) included pigs immunocastrated at 9 and 19 weeks of age, and C (n = 10) contained intact pigs. The results revealed that testicular length of pigs in C was longer than that of both T1 (8.1 ± 0.76 vs 6.5 ± 0.5 cm, p < 0.001) and T2 (8.1 ± 0.76 vs 6.9 ± 1.0, p = 0.007). Spearman correlation coefficients showed negative correlation between testicular length and H-score of AR (r = −0.38, p = 0.037), as well as positive correlation between testicular length and Ki-67 index (r = 0.602, p < 0.001). Generally, mean Ki-67 index and mean H-scores of AR and ERβ of pigs in T1 were not different from those in T2 (p > 0.05). However, mean Ki-67 index and mean AR H-scores of T1 and T2 were significantly different from C group (p < 0.05). In summary, the immunocastration significantly affected testicular length, including expressions of Ki-67, AR, and ERβ in pig testes. Moreover, the duration between two shots of GnRH vaccine could be extended from 4 to 10 weeks without difference in Ki-67 protein, AR, and ERβ immunoexpressions."
"Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and characterization of the attachment site (attB) of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates  2018 Elsevier LtdThis study was designed to screen for SCCmec types and to characterize the attachment site (attB) and universal insertion site (orfX) of SCCmec in a collection of 27 isolates (n = 11) methicillin resistant S. aureus and (n = 16) methicillin susceptible S. aureus isolates in Malaysia. Screening of SCCmec types and characterization of the attachment site was carried out using PCR amplification and Sanger's sequencing method. The result showed that a large proportion of the MRSA isolates carried SCCmec type III 7/11 (63%). Three isolates 3/11 (27%) and 1/11 (9.0%) carried SCCmec type II and IVd respectively. Amplification of the universal insertion site of the SCCmec (orfX) and attachment site (attB) showed that all 16 S. aureus isolates were positive for the orfX gene, while only 7 were positive for the attB gene. Phylogenetic diversity showed that the isolates clustered around strains with features similar to a community acquired MRSA. In conclusion, a high carriage rate of SCCmec type III was observed. The result also showed that all the S. aureus isolates have the orfX structure; however, not all isolates possesses the attB site on the 3′ end of the orfX region."
"Differentially expressed genes in hemocytes of Litopenaeus vannamei challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus AHPND (VPAHPND) and VPAHPND toxin  2018 Elsevier LtdWhile toxin-harboring Vibrio parahaemolyticus has been previously established as the causative agent of early mortality syndrome (EMS) or acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in shrimp, information on the mechanistic processes that happen in the host during infection is still lacking. Here, we examined the expression responses of the shrimp hemocyte transcriptome to V. parahaemolyticus AHPND (VPAHPND) by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Using libraries (SRA accession number SRP137285) prepared from shrimp hemocytes under experimental conditions, a reference library was de novo assembled for gene expression analysis of VPAHPND-challenged samples at 0, 3/6, and 48 h post infection (hpi). Using the library from 0-hpi as the control, 359 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in the 3/6-hpi library, while 429 were differentially expressed in the 48-hpi library. The expression patterns reported in the RNA-seq of 9 representative genes such as anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (LvALF), crustin p (CRU), serpin 3 (SER), C-type lectin 3 (CTL), clottable protein 2 (CLO), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38), protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1 (PKA) and DNAJ homolog subfamily C member 1-like (DNJ) were validated by qRT-PCR. The expression of these genes was also analyzed in shrimp that were injected with the partially purified VPAHPND toxin. A VPAHPND toxin-responsive gene, LvALF was identified, and its function was characterized by RNA interference. LvALF knockdown resulted in significantly rapid increase of shrimp mortality caused by toxin injection. Protein-protein interaction analysis by molecular docking suggested that LvALF possibly neutralizes VPAHPND toxin through its LPS-binding domain. The data generated in this study provide preliminary insights into the differences in the immune response of shrimp to the bacterial and toxic aspect of VPAHPND as a disease."
"Engineering innervated secretory epithelial organoids by magnetic three-dimensional bioprinting for stimulating epithelial growth in salivary glands  2018 Elsevier LtdCurrent saliva-based stimulation therapies for radiotherapy-induced xerostomia are not fully effective due to the presence of damaged secretory epithelia and nerves in the salivary gland (SG). Hence, three-dimensional bio-engineered organoids are essential to regenerate the damaged SG. Herein, a recently validated three-dimensional (3D) biofabrication system, the magnetic 3D bioprinting (M3DB), is tested to generate innervated secretory epithelial organoids from a neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cell, the human dental pulp stem cell (hDPSC). Cells are tagged with magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and spatially arranged with magnet dots to generate 3D spheroids. Next, a SG epithelial differentiation stage was completed with fibroblast growth factor 10 (4–400 ng/ml) to recapitulate SG epithelial morphogenesis and neurogenesis. The SG organoids were then transplanted into ex vivo model to evaluate their epithelial growth and innervation. M3DB-formed spheroids exhibited both high cell viability rate (>90%) and stable ATP intracellular activity compared to MNP-free spheroids. After differentiation, spheroids expressed SG epithelial compartments including secretory epithelial, ductal, myoepithelial, and neuronal. Fabricated organoids also produced salivary α-amylase upon FGF10 stimulation, and intracellular calcium mobilization and trans-epithelial resistance was elicited upon neurostimulation with different neurotransmitters. After transplantation, the SG-like organoids significantly stimulated epithelial and neuronal growth in damaged SG. It is the first time bio-functional innervated SG-like organoids are bioprinted. Thus, this is an important step towards SG regeneration and the treatment of radiotherapy-induced xerostomia."
"Optimisation of electroporation and lipofection protocols to derive the black tiger shrimp cell line (Penaeus monodon)  2018 Elsevier LtdTo achieve in creating permanent shrimp cell lines, cellular arrest of primary cells in the culture is needed to be firstly solved. Considering the insertion of some markers affecting cellular proliferation into primary haemocytes in order to produce the black tiger shrimp cell line and the very low percent of transduced cells previously reported in penaeid shrimps, these paved us the way to set up suitable gene delivery protocols to increase percent of transduced cells in the shrimp as our primary aim. In this study, electroporation and lipofection were used to transfer construct plasmids (pLL3.7 plasmids containing CMV promoters and pGL-IE1-126(A)-EGFP plasmids carrying WSSV IE1 promoters) into primary haemocytes. As it was difficult to distinguish between cells expressing EGFP signal and auto-fluorescence of many dead cells occurred by electroporation during the first 72 h of experiment; so, only lipofection was managed to deliver plasmids into primary cells. Surprisingly, numbers of suspected proliferative cells were derived after electroporation with no insertion of immortalising markers. These cells survived in vitro for up to 45 days with high rate of cell viability, but the number of viable cells decreased throughout the experiment. In addition, these cells expressed genes and proteins closely related to hyaline cells determined using RT-PCR and western blot. For the lipofection experiment, no green fluorescence signal was detected in any primary cell introduced with these plasmids, suggesting that plasmids were not successfully inserted into cells. Also, a number of primary haemocytes had the apoptotic cell death characteristic within 5 days after lipofection. These possibly result from using inappropriate lipofection protocol and chemical substances. In summary, finding out suitable protocols to elevate the percent of transduced cells is still necessary. Additionally, continuous shrimp cell lines would be possibly established by transforming suspected proliferative cells derived from electroporation in this study."
"Enhanced CO2 capturing over ultra-microporous carbon with nitrogen-active species prepared using one-step carbonization of polybenzoxazine for a sustainable environment  2018Nitrogen-enriched porous carbon has been a promising material for CO2 capture in the recent decades. To enhance the performance of CO2 adsorption, both an N-active site and the textural properties are crucial determinants. Herein, ultra-microporous carbon with N-active species was prepared using two synthesis procedures: 1) one-step carbonization of a polybenzoxazine (PBZ) precursor at 800 °C, and 2) the CO2 activation process at 900 °C. The activated porous carbon had the higher specific surface area (943 m2/g) and a total pore volume (0.51 cm3/g) compared to un-activated porous carbon (335 m2/g and 0.19 cm3/g, respectively). In addition, the presence of N-active species such as pyridine-N, secondary-N, pyridone-N, and oxide-N in the carbon structures could be clearly observed in the high-resolution XPS spectra. The CO2 adsorption measurement was performed at 30 and 50 °C under a wide range of pressures (1–7 bar). The maximum amount of CO2 uptake was ca. 3.59 mmol/g for the activated porous carbon operated at 30 °C and a CO2 pressure of 7 bar, which was due to the high specific surface area and the large micropore volume. Specifically, carbon with a 3D interconnected pore structure, derived from the sol-gel process of the PBZ precursor, exhibited good structural stability and consequently led to better absorption capability under the high atmospheric pressure of CO2. The enhanced CO2 adsorption capability for the as-prepared porous carbon was based on two mechanisms: physisorption as a result of textural properties and chemisorption as a result of the acid-base interaction between the basic N functionality and the acidic CO2 gas. All results suggested that ultra-microporous carbon with N-active species prepared from polybenzoxazine is a promising adsorbent for CO2 capture and storage, which can be used at a wide range of pressures and in many applications e.g. flue gas adsorption and natural gas production."
"Stand age estimation of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations using an integrated pixel- and object-based tree growth model and annual Landsat time series  2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS)Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations are a rapidly increasing source of land cover change in mainland Southeast Asia. Stand age of rubber plantations obtained at fine scales provides essential baseline data, informing the pace of industrial and smallholder agricultural activities in response to the changing global rubber markets, and local political and socioeconomic dynamics. In this study, we developed an integrated pixel- and object-based tree growth model using Landsat annual time series to estimate the age of rubber plantations in a 21,115 km2 tri-border region along the junction of China, Myanmar and Laos. We produced a rubber stand age map at 30 m resolution, with an accuracy of 87.00% for identifying rubber plantations and an average error of 1.53 years in age estimation. The integration of pixel- and object-based image analysis showed superior performance in building NDVI yearly time series that reduced spectral noises from background soil and vegetation in open-canopy, young rubber stands. The model parameters remained relatively stable during model sensitivity analysis, resulting in accurate age estimation robust to outliers. Compared to the typically weak statistical relationship between single-date spectral signatures and rubber tree age, Landsat image time series analysis coupled with tree growth modeling presents a viable alternative for fine-scale age estimation of rubber plantations."
"Hydrogel wound dressings loaded with PLGA/ciprofloxacin hydrochloride nanoparticles for use on pressure ulcers  2018 Elsevier B.V.The aim of this research study was to develop polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels containing ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP)-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles as antibacterial materials capable of supporting the treatment of infected pressure ulcers. Either 6.25 mg, 39 mg, or 244 mg of CIP was loaded onto PLGA nanoparticles by using the double emulsion technique. The morphology of the resulting CIP-loaded PLGA nanoparticles was spherical, and the mean diameters were approximately 625.3–957.9 nm. Later, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels loaded with CIP/PLGA nanoparticles were prepared and crosslinked with gamma radiation. The greatest cumulative quantities released from the CIP/PLGA-loaded PVA hydrogels containing 6.25 mg, 39 mg, and 244 mg CIP were 43.38%, 79.75% and 94.63%, respectively. The CIP/PLGA nanoparticles and CIP/PLGA-loaded PVA hydrogels were observed to provide an effective antimicrobial response when exposed to Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, the performance in terms of cell viability had no adverse influence upon the absence of cytotoxicity, as indicated in tests carried out using normal adult human fibroblast cells. It was thus concluded that the CIP/PLGA-loaded hydrogels may be considered as potentially beneficial materials for application in wound dressings with antibacterial properties."
"Overall and Cause-Specific Mortality of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Olmsted County, Minnesota, From 1970 Through 2016  2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and ResearchObjective: To determine the mortality of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and temporal trends in mortality. Patients and Methods: All 895 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, first diagnosed as having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (411 with CD and 484 with UC) from January 1, 1970, through December 31, 2010, were followed through June 30, 2016. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed—expected rates were derived from the US 2010 background population. To determine overall and cause-specific mortality, each patient with IBD was matched with 5 county residents, and Cox regression analysis was used to assess time to death. Results: A total of 895 patients with IBD and 4475 patients without IBD were included. Seventy-four patients with CD died compared with 59.2 expected (SMR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.98-1.57), and 77 patients with UC died compared with 108.1 expected (SMR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.89). In CD, the risk of dying was significantly associated with diagnosis from 1970 through 1979 (SMR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.24-2.78). Of those diagnosed after 1980, the risk of dying in patients with CD was similar to the US background population. In UC, the risk of dying was less than expected in all periods of diagnosis. In the Cox regression analysis, overall mortality was not significantly higher in CD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.97-1.63) or UC (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70-1.14) compared with the comparison cohort. The risk of dying of digestive diseases (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.24-11.0) and respiratory diseases (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.36-5.44) was increased in CD but not UC. Conclusion: In this cohort, overall mortality in patients with CD diagnosed after 1980 did not differ from that in the US background population. Overall mortality in patients with UC diagnosed from 1970 through 2010 was lower than the expected mortality."
"Extended release versus immediate release tacrolimus in kidney transplant recipients: a systematic review and meta-analysis  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: To compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 12 months together with other outcomes among adult kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who received extended release, once daily tacrolimus (ER-Tac) compared to those who received the immediate release, twice daily tacrolimus (IR-Tac) administration. Methods: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, we systematically reviewed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared clinical outcomes between ER-Tac versus IR-Tac in KTRs. The systematic searches were conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL without language restriction. The trials registered and reference lists were also searched and reviewed. Data were extracted for eGFR, serum creatinine (Scr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), biopsy-proven acute rejection rate (BPAR), graft survival, and overall patient survival at different times over 24 months after kidney transplant (KT). A meta-analysis was performed to integrate the results from eligible studies. Results: From 1145 articles screened, 11 RCTs were included. The pooled results of included RCTs showed no significant difference of eGFR at 12 months between ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups (four trials, n = 1738; mean difference − 0.77 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI: − 2.41 to 0.87; p = 0.56; I2 = 0%). Comparing between the two tacrolimus formulations, there were no significant differences of eGFR, CrCl, Scr, BPAR, graft survival, and patient survival at different times over 4 years after transplantation. Conclusions: Based upon currently available evidences in KTRs, the impact on kidney allograft function appears to be comparable between ER-Tac and IR-Tac."
"Different patterns of alcohol consumption and the incidence and persistence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among older adults in Ireland: A prospective community-based study  2018Background: The associations of different patterns of alcohol consumption and the incidence and persistence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in older age remain unclear. Methods: Data on 6095 adults aged ≥ 50 years old from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) was analyzed. Participants completed the CAGE instrument to screen for problematic alcohol use at baseline between October 2009 and February 2011. Outcomes were incident (assessed by the CES-D scale) and anxiety (assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depressive scale) symptoms after a two-year follow-up as well as persistence of probable depression and anxiety among those with a positive screen for those disorders at baseline. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders through multivariable models. Results: In the overall sample, problem drinking did not predict incident and persistent depression and anxiety in this sample. Among females, problem drinking increased the risk for incident depression (OR = 2.11; 95%CI = 1.12–4.00) and anxiety (OR = 2.22; 95%CI = 1.01–4.86). In addition, problem drinking increased the risk of persistent depressive symptoms (OR = 2.43; 95%CI = 1.05–5.06) among females. Conclusion: Problem drinking may increase the risk of incident probable depression and anxiety among older females. Furthermore, problem drinking led to a higher likelihood of persistent depressive symptoms in older female participants. Interventions targeting problem drinking among older females may prevent the onset and persistence of depression in this population, while also decreasing the incidence of anxiety symptoms."
"Enhanced Stability and Propene Yield in Propane Dehydrogenation on PtIn/Mg(Al)O Catalysts with Various In Loadings  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The dehydrogenation of propane on In-promoted Pt (0.3 wt% Pt) supported on hydrotalcite Mg(Al)O with different In loadings (0.2–1.0 wt% In) was investigated at 550 °C atmospheric pressure. All the bimetallic PtIn/Mg(Al)O showed higher propane conversion and propene selectivity than the Pt/Mg(Al)O with Pt0.8In exhibited the best catalytic performances with 97.5% propylene selectivity and 27.5% yield after 5 h time-on-stream. The addition of In to the monometallic Pt catalyst could reduce the acidity strength especially the strong acid site. As revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS results, addition of In by impregnation on Pt/Mg(Al)O also led to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which greatly enhanced the catalyst activity and reduced coke formation on the support. Nevertheless, excessive In loading (i.e., Pt1.0In) resulted in a descending trend of catalyst activity compared to the Pt0.8In, due probably to the large amount of metallic In being formed, which was disadvantageous in propane dehydrogenation."
"The full-length genome characterization, genetic diversity and evolutionary analyses of Senecavirus A isolated in Thailand in 2016  2018 Elsevier B.V.Senecavirus A (SVA) is a novel picornavirus that causes porcine idiopathic vesicular disease characterized by lameness, coronary band hyperemia, and vesicles on the snout and coronary bands. An increase in the detection rate of SVA in several countries suggests that the disease has become a widespread problem. Herein, we report the detection of SVA in Thailand and the characterization of full-length genomic sequences of six Thai SVA isolates. Phylogenetic, genetic, recombination, and evolutionary analyses were performed. The full-length genome, excluding the poly (A) tail of the Thai SVA isolates, was 7282 nucleotides long, with the genomic organization resembling other previously reported SVA isolates. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses based on full-length genome demonstrated that the Thai SVA isolates were grouped in a novel cluster, separated from SVA isolates from other countries. Although the Thai SVA isolates were closely related to 11-55910-3, the first SVA isolate from Canada, with 97.9–98.2%, but they are different. Evolutionary and recombinant analyses suggested that the Thai SVA isolates shared a common ancestor with the 11-55910-3 isolate. The positive selection in the VP4 and 3D genes suggests that the virus was not externally introduced, but rather continuously evolved in the population prior to the first detection. Addition, the presence of SVA could have been ignored due to the presence of other pathogens causing similar clinical diseases. This study warrants further investigations into molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of the SVA in Thailand."

"Kinetics model of microbial degradation by UV radiation and shelf life of coconut water  2018 Elsevier LtdThe aim of this present study was to investigate the effect of UV radiation on microbial inactivation kinetic, quality and shelf life of coconut water. Zero-order and first-order kinetic models were used to investigate microbial degradation (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Lactobacillus plantarum) by UV radiation (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, 8.0 and 12.0 J/mL). UV dose of 1.6, 3.2 and 4.8 J/mL was applied to investigate the effect of UV radiation on physical properties (pH, °Brix, color and turbidity), chemical properties (total phenolic compound or TP and polyphenol oxidase or PPO activity) of coconut water and to investigate the shelf life of coconut water by determination of pink discoloration, total plate count (TPC), and yeast and mold count (YMC) during cold storage at 4 °C for 18 days compared to pasteurized sample (95 °C 100 s). Results showed that microbial inactivation of all bacteria tested in this study followed first-order kinetic model according to higher coefficient of determination (0.9115–0.9656). E. coli O157:H7 was found to be the most sensitive bacteria to UV radiation with regard to highest population reduction in coconut water. In addition, no significant changes were detected in the investigation of L* b* pH, °Brix, titratable acidity, and turbidity of coconut water treated with UV radiation (p > 0.05). However, UV treatment showed significant effect on a* TP and PPO activity (p ≤ 0.05). TPC of all samples increased while YMC decreased during storage at 4 °C. According to microbial investigation during storage at 4 °C, it was found that shelf life of fresh coconut water (control) was 4 days and increased to 6, 10 and 16 days for samples treated with UV dose of 1.6, 3.2 and 4.8 J/mL, respectively. These results of this study support the application of UV radiation in coconut water to preserve quality and prolong shelf life in conjunction with safety aspects as an alternative method to thermal processing."
"Comparative Study of Lewis Acid Transformation on Non-reducible and Reducible Oxides Under Hydrogen Atmosphere by In Situ DRIFTS of Adsorbed NH3  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid was investigated over the Pt/γ-Al2O3 hybrid catalysts in the presence of hydrogen atmosphere by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed NH3. The changes of FTIR spectra were monitored during the introduction of hydrogen at 40 °C and atmospheric pressure for 130 min. The degrees of Lewis acid transformation were varied by addition of non-reducible (SiO2 and Al2O3) and reducible (ZrO2, TiO2 and CeO2) oxides to the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts as the hybrid catalysts. According to the in situ DRIFTS, the hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and the hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) results, the introduction of hydrogen resulted in a decrease in the amount of ammonia adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, and an increase in the amount of ammonium ions on Bronsted acid sites with time on stream. It is proposed that ammonia migration from Lewis acid sites to Bronsted acid sites occurred during the introduction of hydrogen in the presence of Pt particles when compared to the observation of only observed catalysts (without Pt particles). The addition of reducible oxides led to the high rate of Lewis acid transformation, which was higher than those of the non-reducible oxides. Weaker Lewis acid sites and higher amount of hydrogen spillover over the observed catalysts enhanced the rate of Lewis acid transformation in this study. However, the amount of Lewis acid sites at the initial stage did not play an important role in these transformations."
"Microfluidic approach for in situ synthesis of nanoporous silver microstructures as on-chip SERS substrates  2018Nanoporous silver microstructures (np-AgMSs) were first in situ synthesized using a microfluidic system. Chloride induced precipitation with NH4OH was used to prepare AgCl as a sacrificial template. Exploiting the microfluidic platform, effects of reactant concentrations on the morphology of AgCl templates were studied by simply adjusting the input flow rates. The AgCl templates were subsequently reduced into Ag0 or np-AgMSs using chemical reduction. The synthesized np-AgMSs were tested as on-chip SERS substrates using p-aminothiophenol as an analyte. It was found that the np-AgMSs with multipod structures (tripod and tetrapod) provided the highest SERS signal compared to other structures. Finally, the multipod np-AgMSs were successfully used as on-chip SERS substrates for determination of thiocyanate in human saliva. Linearity of the proposed approach was found to be in the range of 1-20 μM with R2 = 0.9887. The LOD and LOQ were 0.1 and 1.5 μM, respectively. Accuracy of the system was investigated from % recovery of spiked thiocyanate standard solutions and found to be in the range of 90-110%. In addition, reproducible Raman signals of thiocyanate were achieved with relative standard deviations of less than 9% for both intraday and interday SERS measurements. These indicated high accuracy and precision of the whole system."
"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Comorbid Major Depression with GAD Are Characterized by Enhanced Nitro-oxidative Stress, Increased Lipid Peroxidation, and Lowered Lipid-Associated Antioxidant Defenses  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Accumulating evidence shows that nitro-oxidative pathways play an important role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) and maybe anxiety disorders. The current study aims to examine superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), paraoxonase 1 (PON1), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and uric acid (UA) in participants with and without generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) co-occurring or not with BD, MDD, or tobacco use disorder. Z unit-weighted composite scores were computed as indices of nitro-oxidative stress driving lipid and protein oxidation. SOD1, LOOH, NOx, and uric acid were significantly higher and HDL and PON1 significantly lower in participants with GAD than in those without GAD. GAD was more adequately predicted by increased SOD + LOOH + NOx and lowered HDL + PON1 composite scores. Composite scores of nitro-oxidative stress coupled with aldehyde and AOPP production were significantly increased in participants with comorbid GAD + MDD as compared with all other study groups, namely MDD, GAD + BD, BD, GAD, and healthy controls. In conclusion, GAD is characterized by increased nitro-oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defenses, while increased uric acid levels in GAD may protect against aldehyde production and protein oxidation. This study suggests that increased nitro-oxidative stress and especially increased SOD1 activity, NO production, and lipid peroxidation as well as lowered HDL-cholesterol and PON1 activity could be novel drug targets for GAD especially when comorbid with MDD."
"Skin picking disorder: Prevalence, correlates, and associations with quality of life in a large sample   Cambridge University Press 2018.Objective Evidence suggests that skin picking disorder (SPD) could be a prevalent condition associated with comorbidity and psychosocial dysfunction. However, just a few studies have assessed the prevalence and correlates of SPD in samples from low-and middle-income countries. In addition, the impact of SPD on quality of life (QoL) dimension after multivariable adjustment to potential confounders remains unclear.Methods Data were obtained from a Brazilian anonymous Web-based research platform. Participants provided sociodemographic data and completed the modified Skin Picking-Stanford questionnaire, the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised inventory (SCL-90R), early trauma inventory self report-short form, and the World Health Organization quality of life abbreviated scale (WHOQOL-Bref). Associations were adjusted to potential confounders through multivariable models.Results For our survey, 7639 participants took part (71.3% females; age: 27.2±7.9 years). The prevalence of SPD was 3.4% (95% CI: 3.0-3.8%), with a female preponderance (P<0.001). In addition, SPD was associated with a positive screen for a major depressive episode, nicotine dependence, and alcohol dependence, as well as suicidal ideation. Physical and psychological QoL was significantly more impaired in participants with SPD compared to those without SPD, even after adjustment for comorbidity.Conclusions In this large sample, SPD was a prevalent condition associated with co-occurring depression, nicotine, and alcohol dependence. In addition, SPD was independently associated with impaired physical and psychological QoL. Public health efforts toward the early recognition and treatment of SPD are warranted."
"Efficacy of a type 2 PRRSV modified live vaccine (PrimePac™ PRRS) against a Thai HP-PRRSV challenge  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The Chinese highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has caused a severe threat to the pig population in Southeast Asian countries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a type 2 PRRSV modified live vaccine (PrimePac™ PRRS, lineage 7) against a Thai HP-PRRSV (10PL01, lineage 8). Three-week-old PRRSV-free pigs were randomly assigned into three groups. Vaccinated challenged group (group 1, n = 16) was immunized with PrimePac™ PRRS vaccine at 3 weeks old. The unvaccinated challenged group (group 2, n = 16) was injected with PBS at 3 weeks old, and unvaccinated unchallenged group (group 3, n = 10) was served as a negative control. At 9 weeks old, all groups, except the negative control group, were challenged with the Thai HP-PRRSV. All pigs were monitored daily during 10 days post-infection (dpi) and were necropsied at 10 and 17 dpi. The results revealed that vaccinated challenged pigs showed significantly lower (p < 0.05) mean rectal temperatures, clinical respiratory scores, lung lesion scores, and levels of virus load in serum and lung tissue compared with the unvaccinated challenged pigs. Moreover, vaccinated challenged pigs exhibited PRRSV-specific serum neutralizing antibodies at the end of the experiment. Our findings indicated that the studied type 2 PRRSV vaccine provided partial protection against the Thai HP-PRRSV infection based on the body temperature, levels of viremia, and the severity of lung lesions. These results demonstrated that partial protection of PrimePac™ PRRS vaccine might be useful for controlling HP-PRRSV infection in the endemic area."
"Simultaneous transesterification and esterification of acidic oil feedstocks catalyzed by heterogeneous tungsten loaded bovine bone under mild conditions  2018 Elsevier LtdA highly active bi-functional catalyst system for the conversion of high free fatty acid content oil feedstock, and waste cooking oil to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), is described. Tungsten loaded CaO/hydroxyapatite materials containing both basic, and acidic sites were derived from addition of 12-phosphotungstic acid to powdered bovine bone (BV), followed by calcination at 750 °C. Addition of 10% tungsten afforded 10 W/BV, which catalyzes FAME production from high acid value oil feedstock (24.38 mg KOH/g of oil) in 7 h at 120 °C at a methanol:oil ratio of 6:1. Conversion of waste cooking oil to FAME via simultaneous transesterification/esterification can be achieved in 5 h at 100 °C and at a methanol:oil ratio of 6:1, significantly more efficient than achievable using other bi-functional catalyst systems. The 10 W/BV catalyst system, readily prepared from a cheap, biomass derived support containing basic sites, is reusable, and allows for the production of fuel quality FAME in high yields from waste cooking oil, allowing for sustainable use of an otherwise wasted resource."
"Acid volatile sulphide estimation using spatial sediment covariates in the Eastern Upper Gulf of Thailand: Multiple geostatistical approaches  2018 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of SciencesAcid volatile sulphide (AVS), one of the most reactive phases in sediments, is a crucial link in explaining a dynamic biogeochemical cycle in a marine ecosystem. Research gaps exist in describing the spatial variation of AVS and interconnections with sediment covariates in the Eastern Upper Gulf of Thailand. Measurements of AVS and auxiliary parameters followed the standard protocol. A comparison of ordinary kriging (OK), cokriging (CK), and regression kriging (RK) performance was evaluated based on the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The concentrations of AVS ranged from 0.003 to 0.349 mg g−1 sediment dry weight. Most parameters contained short range spatial dependency except for oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) and pH. The AVS tended to be both linearly and non-linearly related to ORP and readily oxidisable organic matter (ROM). The RK model, using inputs from the tree-based model, was the most robust of the three kriging methods. It is suggested that nonlinear interactions should be taken into account when predicting AVS concentration, and it is expected that this will further increase the model accuracy. This study helps establish a platform for ecological health and sediment quality guidelines."
"A speedup scheme for MRF stereo using local label hierarchy  2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.Random field formulation has proven to be a powerful framework for solving stereo correspondence problems because of its ability to intuitively incorporate global smoothness constraint with local matching costs. However, solving such problems for cases where large number of pixel variables and possible disparity labels are common can be impractical as the computational complexity grows fast with the number of labels. We proposed a speedup scheme using local label hierarchy in which we exploit characteristics of stereo vision problem to obtain a hierarchical energy minimization technique. In doing so, we give definitions and notations for local label hierarchy as well as approaches for label-wise grouping. We also generalize the definition of energy function to include sets of labels and present heuristics for assigning group potentials. Our approach builds different “local” hierarchy for each variable using information from the energy function which enables us to achieve better performance when compared to using the same hierarchy for every variable. The added processing steps have significantly less theoretical computational complexity than the overall process. Our method was tested with different combinations of cost functions, and our experiment has shown that our heuristics can assist in speeding up the computation time while providing comparable energy and error."
"Nitrous oxide decomposition over La0.3Sr0.7Co0.7Fe0.3O3−Δ catalyst  2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.Nano-sized La0.3Sr0.7Co0.7Fe0.3O3-δ (LSFC3773) was prepared as a catalyst for nitrous oxide (N2O) decomposition by a sonochemical method. The catalyst provided a complete conversion of N2O at 450 °C, showing the best performance among most recent industrial catalysts, and offered 99.7–100% conversion at higher temperatures, e.g., 540–600 °C. A suitable operating temperature range for the reaction to avoid NOx formation is from 400 to 600 °C. The activation energy and the pre-exponential factor were 42.96 kJ/mol and 161,135.35 mol/gcat h bar. Oxygen inhibition was observed and was more obvious as the sample approached full surface coverage (θ=1) at 375 °C using a 100% N2O feed. The reaction occurred via the Eley–Rideal mechanism. Two possible model mechanisms were suggested according to the experimental phenomenon and the rate coefficient order of each elementary steps."
"Roles of membrane and organic fouling layers on the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals in microfiltration  2018To understand the adsorption behavior of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is important for enhancing the treatment performance and preventing potential secondary pollution caused by EDCs desorption in a microfiltration system. The dynamic adsorption of four representative EDCs, namely estriol (E3), 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) in a microfiltration system was investigated using the Thomas’ model. The product of the equilibrium constant and the total adsorption capacity of the membrane, Ka, for E3, E2, EE2, and 4-NP were 4.91, 9.78, 15.6, and 826, respectively, strongly correlating with the compound octanol–water partition coefficient (KOW). Adsorption appeared to be enhanced when organic fouling formed on the surface of membrane, indicating the role of an additional adsorption column for EDCs acted by a fouling layer in microfiltration. Results of a comparison between the Ka values for clean membrane and fouled membrane illustrated that the significant contribution made by fouling layers may be attributed to the foulant layer's hydrophobicity (in the case of calcium humate layer) and thickness (in the case of calcium alginate layer). This study provided a novel perspective to quantitatively analyze the dynamic adsorption behavior of trace pollutants in membrane process."
"Fabrication and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 composite membranes via simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying process  2017In present study, a simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying (SEE) process was employed to produce microclusters of TiO2 nanoparticles and interlock them in nanofibrous network. The photocatalytic composite membranes (PCMs) were fabricated by electrospraying TiO2 nanoparticle suspension into microcluster form that dispersed and entrapped within nylon-6 electrospun fiber membrane. Three PCMs membrane with TiO2 content of 52.0, 83.6, and 91.7 wt.% were successfully fabricated. The membrane consisted of TiO2 microclusters, ranging in sizes from around 0.3 to 10 μm, distributed uniformly within the nylon-6 nanofibrous network. PCMs photocatalytic activity against Methylene Blue (MB) in aqueous solution showed more than 98% MB removal efficiency after 120 min of photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) for all PCMs. For PCM with the highest TiO2 content tested for 5 PCO cycles, it was found that most of their TiO2 content remained incorporated within the nanofibrous structure. The concept of nanoparticles clusters entrapment with SEE fabrication employed here provide a simple and effective method for reducing detachment of nanostructure phase from nanocomposite membrane."
"Characterization and enumeration of complementary dual abelian codes  2017, Korean Society for Computational and Applied Mathematics.Abelian codes and complementary dual codes form important classes of linear codes that have been extensively studied due to their rich algebraic structures and wide applications. In this paper, a family of abelian codes with complementary dual in a group algebra Fpν[G] has been studied under both the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products, where p is a prime, ν is a positive integer and G is an arbitrary finite abelian group. Based on the discrete Fourier transform decomposition for semi-simple group algebras and properties of ideas in local group algebras, the characterization of such codes have been given. Subsequently, the number of complementary dual abelian codes in Fpν[G] has been shown to be independent of the Sylow p-subgroup of G and it has been completely determined for every finite abelian group G. In some cases, a simplified formula for the enumeration has been provided as well. The known results for cyclic complementary dual codes can be viewed as corollaries."
"Protein adsorption and cell behaviors on polycaprolactone film: The effect of surface topography  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Protein adsorption is the first phenomenon that occurs when foreign materials are inserted into the body. Materials used in biomedical applications can have different surface topologies. Knowledge of the effect of the surface on protein adsorption is important due to its influence on cell behavior. The main objective of this study was to analyze polycaprolactone (PCL) films with different surface topologies. Protein adsorption was studied using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the biomolecule. Different surface topologies of PCL were induced by phase separation using solvents with various solubility parameters. The investigated solvents were chloroform, acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and ethanol (EtOH). The PCL films with different surface topologies and protein-adsorbed PCL films were studied with respect to their hydrophobicity, the concentration and nature of functional groups on their surface, their surface roughness, and their cytotoxicity. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the films with the roughest surface were cast from 40:60 EtOH:THF and contained significantly larger amounts of adsorbed protein. Proteins preferentially adsorbed onto rough surfaces. The cell culture also indicated that mouse-calvaria-derived pre-osteoblastic cells proliferated best and exhibited the greatest amount of calcium deposition on the surface with the largest amount of adsorbed protein."
"Alternative models and numerical simulations of rarefied gas flow in vacuum systems  2017 Elsevier LtdAn analytical and a numerical studies of rarefied gas effects on the flow through a vacuum pipe and a rectangular microchannel at low operating pressure are performed by the use of both existing continuum and kinetic approaches. The pipe and the channel operates in a high-Knudsen-, low-Reynolds- numbers regime where the viscous effects as well as the rarefied gas effects dominate the flow. Since only the isothermal flow is focused, the slip-flow at the wall is the main anomaly. The paper shows the implementation of both approaches to predict a rarefied gas flow through a leak artefact. The results from various existing models are compared with the experimental results of a flow through leak artefacts, which were performed by recognized national metrology institutes (NMIs). Pros, cons and the limitation of each approach are pointed out."
"Hydrothermal carbonization of unwanted biomass materials: Effect of process temperature and retention time on hydrochar and liquid fraction  2017 Energy InstituteHydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was applied to examine the feasibility in converting coconut husk (CH) and rice husk (RH) to renewable fuel resource and valuable dissolved organic chemicals. HTC was conducted with varying process temperature (140–200 °C) and retention time (1–4 h). CH was a better feedstock to produce hydrochar as solid fuel than RH because of its compositions was significantly different. An increase in process temperature from 140 to 200 °C resulted in a decrease in hydrochar yield of CH from 77.1 to 67.8%, and corresponding decreases in O/C and H/C from 0.6 and 1.4 to 0.4 and 1.2, respectively, and this was associated to dehydration and decarboxylation reactions. Fuel ratio and HHV were in the range of 0.66–0.86 and 20.7–23.9 MJ/kg, respectively. Liquid fractions (LF) from both RH and CH were found to be abundant in dissolved organic chemicals which were regarded as valuable intermediate chemicals, including furfural, furfuryl alcohol, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and low molecular-weight carboxylic acids (lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, levulinic acid, and propionic acid)."
"The Effect of the Addition of Acetic Acid to Aqueous Ionic Liquid Mixture Using Microwave-assisted Pretreatment in the Saccharification of Napier Grass  2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum cv. Pakchong 1, was pretreated in an ionic liquid mixture through microwave irradiation. To improve the fermentable sugar yield, an acid catalyzed aqueous ionic liquid pretreatment was applied to maximize the total sugar conversion of pretreated Napier grass. Additionally, to optimize the fermentable sugar yield, experiments were carried out employing response surface methodology (RSM). The study showed that a maximum fermentable sugar concentration of 15.72 g/L could be predicted from the model when Napier grass was pretreated by 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM] [OAc]) 50% (v/v) aqueous mixture combined with 1.287% (v/v) acetic acid at a microwave pretreatment temperature and time of 147 °C and 76 min, respectively. The experiments confirmed that the maximum sugar concentration obtained from acidic aqueous ionic liquid pretreatment were 14.38 g/L under the optimal conditions. The results from the Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopic showed that an acid catalyzed aqueous ionic liquid pretreatment removed large fractions of lignin."
"A multi-objective car sequencing problem on two-sided assembly lines  2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.The car sequencing problem consists of sequencing a given set of cars to be produced in each day. This paper presents an application of the extended coincident algorithm (COIN-E), which is an instance of the estimation of distribution algorithms, to a multi-objective car sequencing problem on a more realistic platform, i.e. two-sided assembly lines. Three conflicting objectives are optimised simultaneously in a Pareto sense including minimise the number of paint colour changes, minimise the total number of ratio constraint violations and minimise the utility work. The performances of COIN-E are compared with COIN (its original version), NSGA II, DPSO and BBO. The results reveal that COIN-E is superior to the other contestant algorithms in both solution quality and diversity."
"Study of microstructure and mechanical properties of commercially pure Sn and Sn-4%Bi alloys fabricated by permanent mold gravity casting and forging  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The influences of 4 wt% bismuth addition and room temperature strain on microstructure and mechanical properties in tin alloys were investigated in this study. Commercially pure tin and Sn-4%Bi alloys were fabricated by permanent mold gravity casting. The samples were then subjected to forging process at room temperature. As-cast microstructures were compared with 0.25 and 0.5 strained samples. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to confirm the effect of bismuth on undercooling. The recrystallization and grain growth processes were confirmed by grain size distribution and misorientation study using Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD). Furthermore, position and morphology of the bismuth precipitates were investigated by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that tin oxide was the main species found on the surface of these alloys. There was no evidence of bismuth oxide on the surface. Furthermore, the Hall-Petch hardness approximation analysis revealed that there were other influences, which increased the hardness beyond the grain refinement effect."
"Dependence of catalyst surface in photocatalytic degradation of phenyl urea herbicides  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Photocatalytic degradations of various contaminants using in-house synthesized catalysts have been generally reported, but the degradation intermediates formed are normally inconsistent. This issue is particularly important for the degradation of toxic compounds which may form intermediates with increased toxicity. This work resolves this issue by systematically investigating adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of diuron, linuron, and 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA) on two forms of zinc oxide (ZnO), i.e., conventional particles with zinc-and oxygen-terminated polar surfaces, and nanorods with mixed-terminated non-polar surfaces. Experimental results indicate that both rate of degradation and degradation pathway depend upon the adsorption configuration of the compound undergoing the degradation onto the surface of the catalyst. The adsorption configuration is surface dependent. On polar surfaces, both aliphatic and aromatic sides of diuron and linuron molecules adsorb on the surface, allowing the attack of hydroxyl radicals on both ends. On the other hand, on non-polar surface, only the aliphatic chain adsorbs onto the surface, resulting in the hydroxyl radicals attack only on the aliphatic side. The structure of the catalyst is therefore a crucial factor determining the dominant degradation pathway."
"Tire-suspension-steering hardware-in-the-loop simulation  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Safety and performance have always been important factors in automotive testing. These factors are highly dependent on the tires and suspensions, which should be simulated and tested throughout the development process. During development, Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulations may be used so that testings and tunings can be done earlier in the process. In this paper, designs and configurations of a newly developed tire-suspension-steering HIL are shown. An actual wheel assembly with suspension and steering components can be installed for testing with dynamic models of the rest of the car. The slip angle of the tire can be imposed in the test rig while actual tire forces can be measured and used in the dynamic model. Comparisons of HIL simulations and real experiments using the skidpad test and the step steering test are given using Formula SAE race cars. It was found that the HIL simulation results are more accurate compared to non-HIL simulations."
"Physician professionalism: definition from a generation perspective Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to determine whether consensuses on the definition of emergency physician professionalism exist within and among four different generations. Our secondary objective was to describe the most important characteristic related to emergency physician professionalism that each generation values. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional survey study, using a card-sorting technique, at the emergency departments of two university-based medical centers in the United States. The study was conducted with 288 participants from February to November 2017. Participants included adult emergency department patients, emergency medicine supervising physicians, emergency medicine residents, emergency department nurses, and fourth- and second-year medical students who independently ranked 39 cards that represent qualities related to emergency physician professionalism. We used descriptive statistics, quantitative cultural consensuses and Spearman's correlation coefficients to analyze the data. Results: We found cultural consensuses on emergency physician professionalism in Millennials and Generation X overall, with respect for patients named the most important quality (eigenratio 5.94, negative competency 0%; eigenratio 3.87, negative competency 1.64%, respectively). There were consensuses on emergency physician professionalism in healthcare providers throughout all generations, but no consensuses were found across generations in the patient groups. Conclusions: While younger generations and healthcare providers had consensuses on emergency physician professionalism, we found that patients had no consensuses on this matter. Medical professionalism curricula should be designed with an understanding of each generation's values concerning professionalism. Future studies using qualitative methods across specialties, to assess definitions of medical professionalism in each generation, should be pursued."
"Sulfonic Acid-Containing Flavonoids from the Roots of Phyllanthus acidus  2018 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.Six new sulfonic acid-containing flavonoids, acidoflavanone (1), acidoauronol (2), 5-O-methylacidoauronol (3), acidoaurone (4), acidoisoflavone (5), and acidoflavonol (6), were isolated from the EtOH extract of the roots of Phyllanthus acidus. Their structures were unambiguously established by interpretation of their HRESIMS and 1D and 2D NMR data, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and comparison to the literature data. These new structures represent the first examples of sulfonic acid-containing flavanones, auronols, aurones, and isoflavones."
"CD4/CD8 ratio normalization rates and low ratio as prognostic marker for non-AIDS defining events among long-term virologically suppressed people living with HIV NCT00411983 NCT  2018 The Author(s).Background: Immune restoration is often incomplete after ART in HIV patients, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We studied the incidence and probability of CD4/CD8 normalization in an adult Thai HIV cohort and explored the predictive value of the ratio for developing of non-AIDS defining events (NAEs). Methods: We analyzed data from HIV-infected Thai adults between 1996 and 2017 in the HIV-NAT 006 prospective long-term cohort in Bangkok, Thailand. Normalization was defined as CD4/CD8 ratio ≥ 1 on two consecutive visits, and normalization probability was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. NAEs were a composite endpoint including cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, non-AIDS defining malignancies and death. Multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate demographic, disease and treatment characteristics associated with CD4/CD8 ratio normalization and NAEs. Results: A total of 800 ART-naïve patients with baseline CD4/CD8 ratio of < 0.8 who started combination ART, and had sustained virological suppression were enrolled. Participants were on ART for a median of 8.9 years and virologically suppressed for 6.1 years. The probabilities of CD4/CD8 normalization at 2, 5 and 10 years after virological suppression were 5.1%, 18.6% and 39.1%, respectively. Factors associated with normalization in multivariate analysis were female sex (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.47, 95% CI 1.71-3.56, p < 0.001) and baseline CD4 counts ≥ 350 cells/mm3 (HR: 3.62, 95% CI 2.36-5.55), p < 0.001) vs. < 200 cells/mm3 as reference. The second analysis explored the predictive value of CD4/CD8 ratio for NAEs. Older age (HR: 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13, p < 0.01) and current CD4/CD8 ratio < 0.3 (HR: 3.02, 95% CI 1.27-7.21, p = 0.01) or between 0.3 and 0.45 (HR: 2.03, 95% CI 1.03-3.98, p = 0.04) vs. > 0.45 were independently associated with higher risk of progression to NAEs in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Our findings showed that complete immune recovery is uncommon in an Asian setting and earlier ART initiation at higher CD4 counts may have increased the ratio sooner. The findings demonstrate the use of CD4/CD8 ratio as a prognostic marker for clinical progression of NAEs. Trial registration HIV-NAT 006 cohort, clinical trial number: NCT00411983"

"Enterprise WiFi Hotspot Authentication with Hybrid Encryption on NFC- Enabled Smartphones  2018 IEEE.N owadays, some workplaces have adopted the policy of BYOD (bring your own device) that permits employees to bring personally owned devices, and to use those devices to access company information and applications. Especially, small devices like smartphones are widely used due to the greater mobility and connectivity. A majority of organizations provide the wireless local area network which is necessary for small devices and business data transmission. The resources access through Wi-Fi network of the organization needs intense restriction. WPA2 Enterprise with 802.1X standard is typically introduced to handle user authentication on the network using the EAP framework. However, credentials management for all users is a hassle for administrators. Strong authentication provides higher security whereas the difficulty of deployment is still open issues. This research proposes the utility of Near Field Communication to securely transmit certificate data that rely on the hybrid cryptosystem. The approach supports enterprise Wi-Fi hotspot authentication based on WPA2-802.1X model with the EAP-TLS method. It also applies multi-factor authentication for enhancing the security of networks and users. The security analysis and experiment on establishing connection time were conducted to evaluate the presented approach."
"Two infinite families of resonant solutions for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation  2018 American Physical Society.We consider the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing a Bose-Einstein condensate in an isotropic harmonic trap. In the small coupling regime, this equation is accurately approximated over long times by the corresponding nonlinear resonant system whose structure is determined by the fully resonant spectrum of the linearized problem. We focus on two types of consistent truncations of this resonant system: first, to sets of modes of fixed angular momentum, and, second, to excited Landau levels. Each of these truncations admits a set of explicit analytic solutions with initial conditions parametrized by three complex numbers. Viewed in position space, the fixed angular-momentum solutions describe modulated oscillations of dark rings, while the excited Landau level solutions describe modulated precession of small arrays of vortices and antivortices. We place our findings in the context of similar results for other spatially confined nonlinear Hamiltonian systems in recent literature."
"White spot syndrome virus-induced shrimp miR-315 attenuates prophenoloxidase activation via PPAE3 gene suppression  2018 Jaree, Wongdontri and Somboonwiwat.MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the small non-coding RNAs, play a pivotal role in post-transcriptional gene regulation in various cellular processes. However, the miRNA function in shrimp antiviral response is not clearly understood. This research aims to uncover the function of pmo-miR-315, a white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-responsive miRNAs identified from Penaeus monodon hemocytes during WSSV infection. The expression of the predicted pmo-miR-315 target mRNA, a novel PmPPAE gene called PmPPAE3, was negatively correlated with that of the pmo-miR-315. Furthermore, the luciferase assay indicated that the pmo-miR-315 directly interacted with the target site in PmPPAE3 suggesting the regulatory role of pmo-miR-315 on PmPPAE3 gene expression. Introducing the pmo-miR-315 into the WSSV-infected shrimp caused the reduction of the PmPPAE3 transcript level and, hence, the PO activity activated by the PmPPAE3 whereas the WSSV copy number in the shrimp hemocytes was increased. Taken together, our findings state a crucial role of pmo-miR-315 in attenuating proPO activation via PPAE3 gene suppression and facilitating the WSSV propagation in shrimp WSSV infection."
"CAMSAP3 maintains neuronal polarity through regulation of microtubule stability  2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.The molecular mechanisms that guide each neuron to become polarized, forming a single axon and multiple dendrites, remain unknown. Here we show that CAMSAP3 (calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3), a protein that regulates the minusend dynamics of microtubules, plays a key role in maintaining neuronal polarity. In mouse hippocampal neurons, CAMSAP3 was enriched in axons. Although axonal microtubules were generally acetylated, CAMSAP3 was preferentially localized along a lessacetylated fraction of the microtubules. CAMSAP3-mutated neurons often exhibited supernumerary axons, along with an increased number of neurites having nocodazole-resistant/acetylated microtubules compared with wild-type neurons. Analysis using cell lines showed that CAMSAP3 depletion promoted tubulin acetylation, and conversely, mild overexpression of CAMSAP3 inhibited it, suggesting that CAMSAP3 works to retain nonacetylated microtubules. In contrast, CAMSAP2, a protein related to CAMSAP3, was detected along all neurites, and its loss did not affect neuronal polarity, nor did it cause increased tubulin acetylation. Depletion of α-tubulin acetyltransferase-1 (αTAT1), the key enzyme for tubulin acetylation, abolished CAMSAP3 loss-dependent multiple-axon formation. These observations suggest that CAMSAP3 sustains a nonacetylated pool of microtubules in axons, interfering with the action of αTAT1, and this process is important to maintain neuronal polarity."
"Synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles over Pd-loaded TiO2 prepared by a single-step sol–gel process for deoxygenation of triglycerides  2018Renewable diesel has gained attention in recent years due to its superior fuel properties compared to the conventional biodiesel. The uses of Pd supported TiO2 (Pd/TiO2) and Pd supported activated carbon (Pd/C) catalysts for the deoxygenation of triglycerides to renewable diesel were investigated. Two different types of titania supports, i.e. mesoporous titania synthesized by a surfactant-assisted templating sol–gel method (SG-TiO2) and commercial P25-TiO2 (P25-TiO2), were used to investigate the effect of TiO2 crystal structure on the catalytic activity. The prepared catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 chemisorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The liquid products obtained from the deoxygenation of triglycerides in beef fat over the prepared catalysts at 325 °C, 500 psig, and H2/triglyceride molar ratio of 30 were in the diesel fuel specification range (C15-18). The main liquid products were n-heptadecane (n-C17) and n-pentadecane (n-C15), resulting from the decarboxylation or decarbonylation pathways. It was found that the Pd/P25-TiO2 catalyst exhibited a higher catalytic performance compared to the Pd/C catalyst. The formation of defects (oxygen vacancies and Ti3+) on TiO2, Pd dispersion and inducement of SMSI effect play an important role in the catalytic activity and the diesel yield on Pd/SG-TiO2 catalysts. Furthermore, the Pd incorporation methods, i.e. incipient wetness impregnation (IWI), photochemical deposition (PCD) and single-step sol–gel (SSSG), were also investigated. The Pd/TiO2 prepared by SSSG method exhibited the highest conversion of beef fat and selectivity to the diesel fuel (C15-18) which could be due to its well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles with relatively small size, high defects on TiO2 support and strong SMSI behavior."
"Contrasting timing of virological relapse after discontinuation of tenofovir or entecavir in Hepatitis B e antigen-negative patients  The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Stopping long-term nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy increases hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) loss rates in HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients. Viral rebound may induce immune responses facilitating functional cure. We analyzed which factors are associated with timing of virological relapse in 220 Asian HBeAg-negative patients from the prospective ABX203 vaccine study. Unexpectedly, only the type of antiviral therapy was significantly associated with early virological relapse, defined as an HBV DNA load of >2000 IU/mL until week 12, and relapse occurred earlier in patients treated with tenofovir versus those treated with entecavir (median time, 6 vs 24 weeks; P < .0001). This should be considered for future trialsand monitoring of patients after treatment discontinuation."
"Refining natural rubber matrix for electrically stimulated transdermal drug delivery  2017,  2017 Taylor & Francis.This work focuses on the enhancement of transdermal delivery of indomethacin (IN) from natural rubber matrix by deproteinization, the addition of ethylene glycol (EG) as a plasticizer, and the enlarged matrix size under electrical field. The starting double-centrifuge natural rubber (DCNR) was deproteinized to produce the deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR). Both DCNR and DPNR patches were fabricated by the UV curing method, and blended with EG to enhance the IN loading and release–permeation. Using a pig skin to simulate the human skin, the IN release–permeation was found to increase with increasing plasticizer, removed protein, and applied electrical potential."
"Influence of Alkaline and Alkaline Earth Metal Promoters on the Catalytic Performance of Pd- M /SiO2 (M = Na, Ca, or Ba) Catalysts in the Partial Hydrogenation of Soybean Oil-Derived Biodiesel for Oxidative Stability Improvement  2018 American Chemical Society.Palladium/silica (Pd/SiO2) and Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts, where M stands for sodium (Na), calcium (Ca) or barium (Ba), were studied for their catalytic ability in the partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters (SO-FAMEs) using a semibatch reactor under mild reaction conditions (4 bar hydrogen pressure and 80 °C). The catalytic performance, in terms of turnover frequency (TOF), and the selectivity toward (E)-monounsaturated FAMEs (C18:1) were investigated at 11% and 45% diunsaturated FAME (C18:2) conversion levels. The catalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffractometry, temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide, transmission electron microscopy, pulse chemisorption of carbon monoxide, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On the one hand, the highest TOF was observed with the catalyst with the lowest basic sites on the catalyst surface (Pd-Ba/SiO2) in comparison with the other basic-modified catalysts; on the other hand, the highest selectivity toward (E)-C18:1 was evidently noticed. The oxidative stability of the partially hydrogenated SO-FAMEs (biodiesels) obtained using these catalysts could be improved 2- to 5-fold compared to those of the feed SO-FAMEs."
"Phase transition, structure and color-transition behaviors of monocarboxylic diacetylene and polydiacetylene assemblies: The opposite effects of alkyl chain length  2018 Elsevier B.V.This contribution demonstrates the structural-property relationship of diacetylene(DA) and polydiacetylene(PDA) assemblies in solid state and aqueous suspension. We explore two series of 7 monocarboxylic DA monomers and the resulting PDAs, constituting systematic variation of alkyl chain length at the tail and carboxylic head group position. The shortening of DA alkyl tail causes a reduction of its melting temperature. The shortening of alkyl segment adjacent to the carboxylic head group, in contrary, causes the opposite effect. The DA monomer constituting the shortest alkyl segment exhibits the highest melting temperature. Infrared spectroscopy is utilized to probe the strength of local interactions within these DA assemblies. X-ray diffraction reveals the variation of segmental orientation within the lamella bilayer structure of these DAs and PDAs depending on the alkyl chain length. The change of alkyl length also affects morphology and particle size. The color-transition behaviors of these PDAs investigated upon exposure to heat, ethanol and NaOH show discrepancies. The thermochromic transition temperature of PDAs is consistent with the melting temperature of their DA precursors. Interestingly, perturbation of the systems by adding ethanol or NaOH results in rather different trends, attributed to different local interactions of these stimuli at the interfacial region."
"Variational Formulation of Interaction between Elastic Plate and Elastic Medium under the Influence of Surface Energy  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.A variational formulation of interaction problem is presented in this paper for the analysis of an elastic circular plate under axisymmetric vertical loading resting on an isotropic elastic half-space under the influence of surface energy. The Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory is adopted to take into account the surface energy effects. The contact surface between the plate and the half-space is assumed to be smooth, and the deflected shape of the plate is represented by a power series of the radial coordinate. The undetermined coefficients in the series are determined through the minimization of the total potential energy functional of the plate-half-space system. The accuracy of the present solution is verified by comparing with existing solutions, and selected numerical results are presented to portray the influence of surface energy effects on interaction between an elastic circular plate and an elastic half-space."
"Observation of Higgs Boson Decay to Bottom Quarks  2018 CERN.The observation of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson decay to a pair of bottom quarks is presented. The main contribution to this result is from processes in which Higgs bosons are produced in association with a W or Z boson (VH), and are searched for in final states including 0, 1, or 2 charged leptons and two identified bottom quark jets. The results from the measurement of these processes in a data sample recorded by the CMS experiment in 2017, comprising 41.3 fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV, are described. When combined with previous VH measurements using data collected at s=7, 8, and 13 TeV, an excess of events is observed at mH=125 GeV with a significance of 4.8 standard deviations, where the expectation for the SM Higgs boson is 4.9. The corresponding measured signal strength is 1.01±0.22. The combination of this result with searches by the CMS experiment for H→bb in other production processes yields an observed (expected) significance of 5.6 (5.5) standard deviations and a signal strength of 1.04±0.20."
"Dystroglycan 1: A new candidate gene for patellar luxation in Chihuahua dogs  2018 Mansour, et al.Aim: The objective of this study was to uncover new candidate genes related to patellar luxation (PL) in dogs to select for those with low susceptibility for breeding purposes. Materials and Methods: The inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) technique was performed to construct DNA fingerprints of 61 Chihuahua dogs with PL and 30 healthy Chihuahua dogs. DNA polymorphisms were detected by comparing the sequences between the affected and unaffected dogs, using the pairwise alignments in MultAlin. Genotyping was performed using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR). The association analysis of ISSR DNA fingerprints and genotypes or phenotypes was performed using the Chi-square (χ2) model and generalized linear model (GLM), respectively. Results: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely SNP1UBC811 (g.91175C>G) and SNP2UBC811 (g.92259T>C), were found in the intron of the Dystroglycan 1 (DAG1) gene, which was obtained using the PL-related marker UBC811 primer (p=0.02), and genotyped by AS-PCR. When investigated using the GLM, g.91175C>G had a significant association with PL (p=0.0424), whereas g.92259T>C did not have such an association (p=0.0959). Conclusion: DAG1 might be one of the genes related to PL in Chihuahuas and could aid the process of marker-assisted selection in genetic breeding for Chihuahua dogs without PL."
"Modulation of bovine herpesvirus 1 infection by virally encoded microRNAs  2018 Elsevier B.V.Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae in the order Herpesviridae and is a ubiquitous pathogen of cattle responsible for significant economic loss worldwide. The BoHV-1 genome encodes at least 10 BoHV-1 microRNA (miRNA) genes, whose functions remain poorly understood. This study sought to understand the role of three BoHV-1 miRNA genes, Bhv1-miR-B6, Bhv1-miR-B8 and Bhv1-miR-B9, which are located proximal to the BoHV-1 origins of replication (OriS). Therefore, plasmids expressing the precursor miRNA hairpins for the Bhv1-miR-B6, Bhv1-miR-B8, and Bhv1-miR-B9 genes were constructed and transfected into Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells prior to BoHV-1 infection. Interestingly, transient expression of either Bhv1-miR-B8 or Bhv1-miR-B9 in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells prior to infection resulted in partial suppression of BoHV-1 replication, quantified through estimating levels of glycoprotein C mRNA and protein levels. Putative interactions between the mature miRNA bhv1-miR-B8-3p and bhv1-miR-B9 and BoHV-1 transcripts were identified providing plausible pathways for these molecules to affect virus replication. Therefore, these two miRNAs are implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of BoHV-1 transcripts important for virus replication and could be used to limit BoHV-1 replication."
"Theoretical study on electronic properties of curved graphene quantum dots  2018 Elsevier B.V.Electronic properties of curved graphene quantum dots (CGQDs) were studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. Two shapes of the zigzag-edged CGQDs, i.e., rhomboidal (RGQDs) and hexagonal (HGQDs) graphene quantum dots, and each with five sizes were studied. For each GQD, its structure was curved along symmetry-unique folding axes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160. There are four unique folding axes (FA1, FA2, FA3, and FA4) for RGQDS and only two axes for HGQDs (FA1 and FA2). The results showed that HOMO and LUMO energies of CGQDs depend on size, shape, folding axis, and folding degree. The band gap (HOMO-LUMO gap) at different folding degrees were monitored for all structures. For the folding at FA1, FA2, and FA4 of RGQDs and FA1 and FA2 of HGQDs, the narrowing of the band gap was observed, while only for the folding at FA3 of RGQDs the band gap widening was found. Orbital interactions can explain the narrowing/widening of the band gap of CGQDs. The energy used for curving GQDs (the deformation energy) depends on the size and folding axis but not their shape. The “armchair-like” folding has higher deformation energy than the “zigzag-like” one. The deformation energy is related to the folding strain and the number of the same-symmetry axis. The number of the same-symmetry axis is also related to the size of GQDs."
"Mantle and deep crustal xenoliths in basalts from the Bo Rai ruby deposit, eastern Thailand: Original source of basaltic ruby  2018 Elsevier LtdVarious types of xenoliths embedded in basalts within Bo Rai ruby deposit, Trat Province, eastern Thailand can be petrographically subdivided into three main types: (1) peridotites (Ol-Cpx-Opx-Sp bearing xenoliths), (2) clinopyroxenites (Cpx–Sp–Grt ± Ol ± Opx bearing xenoliths) and (3) mafic granulites, including garnet- and corundum-bearing type (Pl–Cpx–Sp ± Grt ± Cor bearing xenoliths). Peridotitic xenoliths, Type 1, have characteristics of a depleted mantle provenance and are varying from lherzolite to harzburgite and dunite. Type 2 xenoliths have petrological and geochemical characteristics of a cumulate. Clinopyroxene, spinel and garnet are commonly found whereas olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase may be present in the nodules. Type 3 xenoliths represent another type of a cumulate rock. Based on textural and mineral chemical evidence, the cumulate type xenoliths were overprinted by a few metamorphic events. The whole-rock geochemistry indicates clearly a differentiation of these xenoliths. MgO contents decrease continuously from peridotite (type 1) to clinopyroxenite (type 2) and mafic granulite (type 3) xenoliths. The behavior of compatible and incompatible elements correlates well with MgO as expected for mantle rocks and crystallizing melts. PT estimates yield about 1000–1300 °C at 1.6–1.9 GPa for type 1 xenoliths, 950–1200 °C at 1.6–2.2 GPa and 700–>1000 °C at 0.95–1.3 GPa for type 2 and type 3 xenoliths, respectively. The original ruby formation clearly relates to mafic granulite xenoliths (type 3) which appear to have formed at about 30–50 km depths before picking up and transport onto the surface via basaltic eruption."
"Discussion of “Effects of misalignment on the undrained HV capacity of suction anchors in clay” by A. Saviano and F. Pisanò  2018 Elsevier LtdThis discussion is based on the paper by Saviano and Pisanò (2017) (hereafter identified as “the original authors” or “the original paper”). The original authors employed a three-dimensional finite element analysis to investigate the effects of misalignment on the undrained capacity of suction anchors subjected to horizontal (H) and vertical loadings (V). In the original paper, various parametric studies including the misalignment angle, the anchor aspect ratio, the soil strength profile, and the interface adhesion factor on the HV failure envelope of suction anchors were comprehensively carried out. The discussion addresses the issues of the three-dimensional modelling approach for suction anchors using the model of the single anchor/plug rigid body employed in the original paper and questions the validity of the model if it corresponds to the most accurate representation of the numerical model for this type of offshore foundation."
"DFT investigation on adsorption of di–, tri– and tetra–atomic gases on Sc–doped ZnO sodalite like cage for gas sensing purpose  2018 Elsevier B.V.Structure optimizations for adsorption configurations of di–, tri– and polyatomic gases on Sc–doped ZnO sodalite like cage (Sc–ZnOSL) were carried out using the DFT/B3LYP/GEN method. Energetics, enthalpies and Gibbs free energies of gas adsorptions were obtained. Adsorption of SO2 on the Sc–ZnOSL was found to be the most energetically preferred configuration. Since, energy gaps for the Sc–ZnOSL and its adsorption–state structures were analyzed as a function of electric conductivity, it was found that the largest decrease of energy gap was taken placed after bridge–structured adsorption of N2O on the Sc–ZnOSL. The suggestion is that Sc–ZnOSL may be developed for N2O and SO2 sensing material."
"Thermal-induced folding and unfolding of a transmembrane protein (CorA)  2018 Elsevier B.V.Thermal response of the inner (iCorA) and outer (oCorA) segments of a transmembrane protein CorA is investigated by a large-scale coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulation in native phase. We find that the conformation of iCorA contracts on raising the temperature, in contrast to its thermal response in denatured phase. The conformational response of the oCorA in its native phase appears to be less organized but differs considerably from that in its denatured phase where an abrupt increase of its radius of gyration occurs in a narrow temperature range. The inner segment (iCorA) retains its globular conformation in native phase while oCorA resorts to random-coil configurations with some coagulations on raising the temperature."
"Interrogation of ethnomedicinal plants for synthetic lethality effects in combination with deficiency in the DNA repair endonuclease RAD1 using a yeast cell-based assay  2018 Elsevier B.V.Ethnopharmacological relevance: Plant materials used in this study were selected based on the ethnobotanical literature. Plants have either been utilized by Thai practitioners as alternative treatments for cancer or identified to exhibit anti-cancer properties. Aim of the study: To screen ethnomedicinal plants using a yeast cell-based assay for synthetic lethal interactions with cells deleted for RAD1, the yeast homologue of human ERCC4 (XPF) Materials and methods: Ethanolic extracts from thirty-two species of medicinal plants utilized in Thai traditional medicine were screened for synthetic lethal/sick interactions using a yeast cell-based assay. Cell growth was compared between the parental strain and rad1∆ yeast following exposure to select for specific toxicity of plant extracts. Candidate extracts were further examined for the mode of action using genetic and biochemical approaches. Results: Screening a library of ethanolic extracts from medicinal plants identified Bacopa monnieri and Colubrina asiatica as having synthetic lethal effects in the rad1∆ cells but not the parental strain. Synthetic lethal effects for B. monneiri extracts were more apparent and this plant was examined further. Genetic analysis indicates that pro-oxidant activities and defective excision repair pathways do not significantly contribute to enhanced sensitivity to B. monneiri extracts. Exposure to B. monneiri extracts resulted in nuclear fragmentation and elevated levels of ethidium bromide staining in rad1∆ yeast suggesting promotion of an apoptosis-like event. Growth inhibition also observed in the human Caco-2 cell line suggesting the effects of B. monnieri extracts on both yeast and human cells may be similar. Conclusions: B. monneiri extracts may have utility in treatment of colorectal cancers that exhibit deficiency in ERCC4 (XPF)."
"Water balance of pine forests: Synthesis of new and published results  2018 Elsevier B.V.The forest hydrologic cycle is expected to have important feedback responses to climate change, impacting processes ranging from local water supply and primary productivity to global water and energy cycles. Here, we analyzed water budgets of pine forests worldwide. We first estimated local water balance of forests dominated by two wide-ranging species: Pinus taeda (36 °N) and Pinus sylvestris (64 °N). In these stands, growing season evapotranspiration (ET) was largely insensitive to inter-annual variation of precipitation (P), consistent with the insensitivity of canopy transpiration to P. Extending the analyses to include published data from 117 studies on 27 pine species, we found that pine forests annually use ∼66% ± 17% (SD) of P as ET, regardless of climatic regime, leaving a third of P as runoff to downstream aquatic ecosystems and users. However, during the growing season, pine forests used more water as ET than P in regions where P ≤ 326 ± 39 (SE) mm. Forests in regions of low growing season P exist in their current state only where the rooting depth is sufficient to supply trees with water from soil storage in addition to P, and these forests are likely to support only ephemeral streams that dry down during the growing season. Thus, globally, water use by pine forests is adapted to mean annual P, but shows a limited capacity to respond to inter-annual variability in P. Forests with a small buffer of growing season water availability (P + soil water storage - ET), are likely to be most sensitive to variation in P regimes, changing canopy leaf area, tree density, and species composition depending on the degree, direction and persistence of the change in P."
"The SISAL database: A global resource to document oxygen and carbon isotope records from speleothems  Author(s) 2018.Stable isotope records from speleothems provide information on past climate changes, most particularly information that can be used to reconstruct past changes in precipitation and atmospheric circulation. These records are increasingly being used to provide <q>out-of-sample</q> evaluations of isotope-enabled climate models. SISAL (Speleothem Isotope Synthesis and Analysis) is an international working group of the Past Global Changes (PAGES) project. The working group aims to provide a comprehensive compilation of speleothem isotope records for climate reconstruction and model evaluation. The SISAL database contains data for individual speleothems, grouped by cave system. Stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon (18O, 13C) measurements are referenced by distance from the top or bottom of the speleothem. Additional tables provide information on dating, including information on the dates used to construct the original age model and sufficient information to assess the quality of each data set and to erect a standardized chronology across different speleothems. The metadata table provides location information, information on the full range of measurements carried out on each speleothem and information on the cave system that is relevant to the interpretation of the records, as well as citations for both publications and archived data. The compiled data are available at <a hrefCombining double low line""https://doi.org/10.17864/1947.147."
"Delta-like ligand 4 in hepatocellular carcinoma intrinsically promotes tumour growth and suppresses hepatitis B virus replication  The Author(s) 2018. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.AIM To investigate the role of Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) on tumour growth in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vivo . METHODS We suppressed DLL4 expression in an HBV expressing HCC cell line, HepG2.2.15 and analysed the growth ability of cells as subcutaneous tumours in nude mice. The expression of tumour angiogenesis regulators, VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 in tumour xenografts were examined by western blotting. The tumour proliferation and neovasculature were examined by immunohistochemistry. The viral replication and viral protein expression were measured by quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. RESULTS Eighteen days after implantation, tumour volume in mice implanted with shDLL4 HepG2.2.15 was significantly smaller than in mice implanted with control HepG2.2.15 (P < 0.0001). The levels of angiogenesis regulators, VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 were significantly decreased in implanted tumours with suppressed DLL4 compared with the control group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, the suppression of DLL4 expression in tumour cells reduced cell proliferation and the formation of new blood vessels in tumours. Unexpectedly, increased viral replication was observed after suppression of DLL4 in the tumours. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that DLL4 is important in regulating the tumour growth of HBV-associated HCC as well as the neovascularization and suppression of HBV replication."
"Thermodynamic study on the integrated supercritical water gasification with reforming process for hydrogen production: Effects of operating parameters  2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCIn this paper, a conceptual process design of the integrated supercritical water gasification (SCWG) and reforming process for enhancing H2 production has been developed. The influence of several operating parameters including SCWG temperature, SCWG pressure, reforming temperature, reforming pressure and feed concentration on the syngas composition and process efficiency was investigated. In addition, the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations have been carried out based on Gibbs free energy minimization by using Aspen Plus. The results showed that the higher H2 production could be obtained at higher SCWG temperature, the H2 concentration increased from 5.40% at 400 °C to 38.95% at 600 °C. The lower feed concentration was found to be favorable for achieving hydrogen-rich gas. However, pressure of SCWG had insignificant effect on the syngas composition. The addition of reformer to the SCWG system enhanced H2 yield by converting high methane content in the syngas into H2. The modified SCWG enhanced the productivity of syngas to 151.12 kg/100kgfeed compared to 120.61 kg/100kgfeed of the conventional SCWG system. Furthermore, H2 yield and system efficiency increased significantly from 1.81 kg/100kgfeed and 9.18% to 8.91 kg/100kgfeed, and 45.09%, respectively, after the modification."
"Hydrogen and power generation from supercritical water reforming of glycerol and pressurized SOFC integrated system: Use of different CO2 adsorption process  2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe performance analysis of an integrated system of glycerol supercritical water reforming and pressurized SOFC was presented. The use of different CO2 adsorption processes that include in situ and ex situ processes was compared to determine the suitable process for hydrogen and power generations. The influence of operating condition, e.g., temperature and pressure of reformer, supercritical water to glycerol (S/G) molar ratio, and calcium oxide to glycerol (CaO/G) molar ratio was examined. Then, the electrical performance of each integrated process was considered with respect to the SOFC conditions comprising temperature, pressure, and current density. The simulation results revealed that both processes have same favourable conditions for temperature and pressure operated at 800 °C and 240 atm, respectively. The suitable S/G and CaO/G molar ratios for in situ process are 10 and 2 whereas those for ex situ process are 20 and 1. Under these conditions, maximum hydrogen can be achieved as 87% and 75% for in situ and ex situ processes, respectively. When both integrated processes are operated at the optimal SOFC conditions as 900 °C, 4 atm, and current density of 10,000 A/m2, the SOFC efficiency of 71.56% and 62.12% can provide for in situ and ex situ processes, respectively."
"Cefepime dosing regimens in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy: A Monte Carlo simulation study  2018 The Author(s).Background: Cefepime can be removed by continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to its pharmacokinetics. The purpose of this study is to define the optimal cefepime dosing regimens for critically ill patients receiving CRRT using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). Methods: The CRRT models of cefepime disposition during 48 h with different effluent rates were developed using published pharmacokinetic parameters, patient demographic data, and CRRT settings. Pharmacodynamic target was the cumulative percentage of a 48-h period of at least 70% that free cefepime concentration exceeds the four times susceptible breakpoint of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC of 8). All recommended dosing regimens from available clinical resources were evaluated for the probability of target attainment (PTA) using MCS to generate drug disposition in a group of 5000 virtual patients for each dose. The optimal doses were defined as achieving the PTA at least 90% of virtual patients with lowest daily doses and the acceptable risk of neurotoxicity. Results: Optimal cefepime doses in critically ill patients receiving CRRT with Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommended effluent rates were a regimen of 2 g loading dose followed by 1.5-1.75 g every 8 h for Gram-negative infections with a neurotoxicity risk of < 17%. Cefepime dosing regimens from this study were considerably higher than the recommended doses from clinical resources. Conclusion: All recommended dosing regimens for patients receiving CRRT from available clinical resources failed to achieve the PTA target. The optimal dosing regimens were suggested based on CRRT modalities, MIC values, and different effluent rates. Clinical validation is warranted."
"A Matrix Decomposition Method for Odd-Type Gaussian Normal Basis Multiplication  2018 IEEE.Normal basis is used in many applications because of the efficiency of the implementation. However, most space complexity reduction techniques for binary field multiplier are applicable for only optimal normal basis or Gaussian normal basis of even type. There are 187 binary fields GF 2k for k from 2 to 1,000 that use odd-type Gaussian normal basis. This paper presents a method to reduce the space complexity of odd-type Gaussian normal basis multipliers over binary field GF 2k. The idea is adapted from the matrix decomposition method for optimal normal basis. The result shows that our space complexity reduction method can reduce the number of XOR gates used in the implementation comparing to previous works with a small trade-off in critical path delay."
"Quantum Rough Counting and Its Application to Grover's Search Algorithm  2018 IEEE.We propose in this paper a rough counting algorithm and modified version of Grover's search algorithm. The proposed counting algorithm uses Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm to roughly estimate the number of items satisfying some search conditions by reconstructing the output distribution. The modified Grover's search combines the counting into one part of the algorithm and uses the counting result to determine the number of Grover's iterations taken to get such items. We provide an analysis of expected probability of the proposed algorithm taking into account the problem size, the number of satisfying items and the query complexity to show that the proposed modified Grover's search is optimal."
"Alternative Redundant Residue Number System Construction with Redundant Residue Representations  2018 IEEE.Residue number system (RNS) is a number representation system that represents a large integer with several smaller integers. Due to its ability to perform addition and multiplication in parallel, RNS is widely used in signal processing, communication, and cryptography. To extend the ability of RNS, redundant residue number system (RRNS), which has abilities to detect and correct errors, is proposed to be used in fault tolerant applications. Currently, there are two major ways to construct RRNS from RNS. This paper proposes an alternative way to do the construction by using redundant residue representations. Our proposed RRNS can perform certain operations more efficiently, for example, backward conversion and error detection, and can also perform a complex RNS operation, namely, comparing the values between two RRNS representations. However, it would have more costs to perform addition and multiplication on our RRNS. We also compare our work to the two previous works, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Further investigations are required to improve the performance of the proposed RRNS."
"Knowledge Sharing in Cooperative Compact Genetic Algorithm  2018 IEEE.In this study, we present three methods of sharing knowledge between cooperative compact genetic algorithms. The methods exploit the effect of the worse solutions of the two-cooperative compact genetic algorithms to the search space which can prevent premature convergence. The benefit also encourages exploring other areas in solution space which enhance the opportunity to discover the better solutions. The proposed algorithm has a simple structure requires much less execution time than the non-sharing compact genetic algorithm."
"Fitting rotation curves of galaxies by de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity  2018 American Physical Society.We investigate the effects of massive gravitons on the rotation curves of the Milky Way, spiral galaxies, and low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. Using a simple de Rham, Gabadadze, and Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity model, we find a static spherically symmetric metric and a modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. The dRGT nonlinear graviton interactions generate density and pressures, which behave like dark energy that can mimic the gravitational effects of a dark matter halo. We find that rotation curves of most galaxies can be fitted well by a single constant-gravity parameter γ∼mg2C∼10-28 m-1 corresponding to the graviton mass in the range mg∼10-21-10-30 eV depending on the choice of the fiducial metric parameter C∼1-1018 m. Fitting the rotation curve of the Milky Way puts a strong constraint on the Yukawa-type coupling of the massive graviton exchange as a result of the shell effects."
"Thermal Stress Evaluation of Tunneling Magnetoresistive Structures in Data Storage Devices  2018 IEEE.The conventional read sensor technology used in hard disk drives is the tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) device. The technology evolution of the TMR device toward higher signal-to-noise performance has been achieved through aggressive scaling of the thin film layered structures in the device to the point that thermal stability and thermally induced degradation have come to limit reliability. In this study, a thermal stress has been applied to TMR devices between 150-250°C, and the resistance, amplitude, and asymmetry parameters, both before and after the thermal stress, were measured using a quasi-static test (QST). The results reveal a temperature dependence of the TMR device performance. The microstructure of the annealed devices was further studied using transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, revealing structural defects that are related to the QST parametric changes. Both atomic misalignment of the MgO layer and Ir depletion are proposed as origins for the instability of the magnetic response in the device after thermal stress."
"Assessment of bacterial accumulation and environmental factors in sentinel oysters and estuarine water quality from the Phang Nga Estuary Area in Thailand  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This study characterized microbiological and chemical contamination of oyster meat and estuarine water in Phang Nga, Thailand. Pooled oyster meats (n = 144), estuarine waters (n = 96) and environmental parameters were collected from March, 2016 to February, 2017, and assessed for levels of total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), Escherichia coli (EC), and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP), presence of Salmonella and Shigella and levels of heavy metals (Mn, Pb and Cd). The prevalence of TC, FC and EC were in 99.3%, 94.4% and 93.1% of oyster meat and 94.8%, 79.2%, and 78.1% of water, respectively. The average VP levels was 8.5 × 107 most probable number (MPN)/g oyster. Prevalence of Shigella and Salmonella in the pooled oysters were 7.6% and 30.6%, respectively. The dominant Salmonella serovars were Paratyphi B followed by Seremban, and Kentucky. In contrast, the prevalence of Shigella were 27.1%, but Salmonella was not detected in estuarine water. Factors statistically associated with EC accumulation in oyster were level of FC, 7-day average precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and presence of Salmonella in the sample. The optimal cutoff value of EC to predict Salmonella in oyster was 420 MPN/g. Results indicate this area has relatively safe levels of heavy metals, whereas bacterial contamination was very high for oysters."
"Rational use of paracetamol among out-patients in a Bhutanese district hospital bordering India: A cross-sectional study  2018 The Author(s).Objective: Paracetamol or acetaminophen is a weak analgesic commonly used worldwide and in Bhutan. It is available across all levels of Bhutan's health care system and for purchase without prescription. Little is known, however, about patterns of paracetamol use in Bhutan. This study aimed to assess what the Bhutanese population knows about the indications for use of paracetamol, safe use, and common patterns of usage (frequency, dosage). These questions were studied among Bhutanese living in Phuentsholing, a large commercial town at Bhutan-India border. Results: Among 441 participants, most (72.1%) reported having used paracetamol in the past 1 year. The mean knowledge score was 57.6%; only 30 participants (6.8%) had what was characterized as ""good knowledge."" Level of knowledge was positively associated with level of education (p = 0.031). Less than half (41.3%) had a ""good attitude"" towards use of paracetamol. In practice, few (4.8%) knew the correct dose, including about one in ten who reported exceeding the recommended therapeutic dose. Most knew about side effects (61.2%) and possible allergic reactions (77.3%). Many participants (47.9%) acknowledged that the self-use of paracetamol may not reduce the number of hospital visits."
"D-branes (or not) in the non-Abelian T-dual of the SU(2) WZW model  2018 The Author(s)Following on from a previous article [1], we consider open strings in the non-Abelian T-dual of the SU(2)k WZW model, with respect to the vector SU(2) isometry. Since in this case the dual theory has an exact CFT description, we look at the chiral algebra-preserving D-branes. The general conclusion is that a large set of branes, while consistent boundary conditions on the worldsheet, are sent to infinity in the target space. This suggests inconsistency of the strict non-Abelian duality with open strings, in this case."
"Major typhoon phases in the upper Gulf of Thailand over the last 1.5 millennia, determined from coastal deposits on rock islands  2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUARapid growth of Asian megacities, exemplified by the megacity of Bangkok, Thailand, with a population of over 10 million inhabitants, means that an increasing number of people are living in low-lying coastal areas exposed to hazards such as typhoons. While Bangkok has always been considered not to be at risk from typhoon strikes, recent discoveries of elevated carbonate boulder deposits have started to question this assumption. This work reports on findings from the islands of Ko Khang Khao and Ko Phai, farther north and west than earlier studies, and adds to the existing body of evidence for prehistorical typhoon-driven high energy marine inundation (HEMI) events penetrating northwards into the Bay of Bangkok. Elevated carbonate boulder deposits up to 6 m amsl indicate that these were emplaced by waves generating onshore minimum flow velocities between 3.0 and 5.5 m/s, consistent with typhoon-impacted coastlines elsewhere in the tropical Asia-Pacific region. When viewed in conjunction with other data from the Bay of Bangkok their chronologies indicate age clusters around four major phases of activity in AD 600–700, AD 900–1000, AD 1150–1250 and AD 1400–1650. At 250 years duration, the last phase of activity was the longest, but it has also been followed by the longest period of quiescence that has coincided with rapid urban growth in and around the city of Bangkok. The re-occurrence of typhoon-driven HEMI events on the scale of the prehistorical events reported here would threaten all the low-lying coasts in the Bay of Bangkok, including the Chao Phraya delta, and as such these results indicate an urgent need to re-evaluate coastal hazards for the region."
"Modulated expression of the HIV-1 2LTR zinc finger efficiently interferes with the HIV integration process  2018 The Author(s).Lentiviral vectors have emerged as the most efficient system to stably transfer and insert genes into cells. By adding a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible promoter, transgene expression delivered by a lentiviral vector can be expressed whenever needed and halted when necessary. Here we have constructed a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible lentiviral vector which efficiently introduces a designed zinc finger protein, 2-long terminal repeat zinc-finger protein (2LTRZFP), into hematopoietic cell lines and evaluated its expression in pluripotent stem cells. As a result this lentiviral inducible system can regulate 2LTRZFP expression in the SupT1 T-cell line and in pluripotent stem cells. Using this vector, no basal expression was detected in the T-cell line and its induction was achieved with low Dox concentrations. Remarkably, the intracellular regulatory expression of 2LTRZFP significantly inhibited HIV-1 integration and replication in HIV-inoculated SupT1 cells. This approach could provide a potential tool for gene therapy applications, which efficiently control and reduce the side effect of therapeutic genes expression."
"Thermoresponsive Bacteriophage Nanocarrier as a Gene Delivery Vector Targeted to the Gastrointestinal Tract  2018 The Author(s)The use of the gastrointestinal tract as a site for the local delivery of DNA is an exciting prospect. In order to obtain an effective vector capable of delivering a gene of interest to target cells to achieve sufficient and sustained transgene expression, with minimal toxicity, we developed a new generation of filamentous bacteriophage. This particular bacteriophage was genetically engineered to display an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif (an integrin-binding peptide) on the major coat protein pVIII and carry a mammalian DNA cassette. One unanticipated observation is the thermoresponsive behavior of engineered bacteriophage. This finding has led us to simplify the isolation method to purify bacteriophage particles from cell culture supernatant by low-temperature precipitation. Our results showed that, in contrast to non-surface modified, the RGD-modified bacteriophage was successfully used to deliver a transgene to mammalian cells. Our in vitro model of the human intestinal follicle-associated epithelium also demonstrated that bacteriophage particles were stable in simulated gastrointestinal fluids and able to cross the human intestinal barrier. In addition, we confirmed an adjuvant property of the engineered bacteriophage to induce nitric oxide production by macrophages. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the possibility of using bacteriophage for gene transfer in the gastrointestinal tract."
"A Comparative Study on Various Deep Learning Techniques for Thai NLP Lexical and Syntactic Tasks on Noisy Data  2018 IEEE.In Natural Language Processing (NLP), there are three fundamental tasks of NLP which are Tokenization being a part of a lexical level, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS) and Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) being parts of a syntactic level. Recently, there have been many deep learning researches showing their success in many domains. However, there has been no comparative study for Thai NLP to suggest the most suitable technique for each task yet. In this paper, we aim to provide a performance comparison among various deep learning-based techniques on three NLP tasks, and study the effect on synthesized OOV words and the OOV handling algorithm with Levenshtein distance had been provided due to the fact that most existing works relied on a set of vocabularies in the trained model and not being fit for noisy text in the real use case. Our three experiments were conducted on BEST 2010 I2R, a standard Thai NLP corpus on F1 measurement, with the different percentage of noises having been synthesized. Firstly, for Tokenization, the result shows that Synthai, a jointed bidirectional LSTM, has the best performance. Additionally, for POS, bi-directional LSTM with CRF has obtained the best performance. For NER, variational bi-directional LSTM with CRF has outperformed other methods. Finally, the effect of noises reduces the performance of all algorithms on these foundation tasks and the result shows that our OOV handling technique could improve the performance on noisy data."
"Online Emerging Topic Detection on Twitter Using Random Forest with Stock Indicator Features  2018 IEEE.Social media is one of the most impactful and fastest communication methods. By monitoring Twitter streams, we are able to detect emerging topics and understand events around the world. There are some prior attempts that aim to online detect topics on Twitter. However, they can only detect bursty topics by using user-defined keywords a long with simple rules. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to detect emerging topics on Twitter streams. To detect emerging topics, a clustering technique has been applied to aggregate a set of keywords. Since an emerging topic occurs continuously, the emerging topics are merged with stateful technique to accumulate topics from different time intervals. To detect both high signal topics and small-medium signal topics, we use statistical features based on average, acceleration, and z-score. Moreover, we propose to include the stock indicator features: Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH). They are common features in trend (oversold and overbought) detection in stock analysis which is similar to our topic detection in twitter. To capture any event patterns, Random Forest (RF) has been proposed as a classifier to detect emerging keywords by utilizing the stated above five features. To evaluate the performance, we created and published a corpus by collecting Twitter data for 10 days with over 80 million tweets and then labeling possible topics in tota1161 events along with related keywords. The experiment was conducted on our collected data. The Fl-results show that our model outperforms all baselines: TwitterMonitor, SigniTrend, and TopicSketch, in terms of detected keywords and topics."
"Semantic Segmentation on Medium-Resolution Satellite Images Using Deep Convolutional Networks with Remote Sensing Derived Indices  2018 IEEE.Semantic Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision and remote sensing imagery. Many applications, such as urban planning, change detection, and environmental monitoring, require the accurate segmentation; hence, most segmentation tasks are performed by humans. Currently, with the growth of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), there are many works aiming to find the best network architecture fitting for this task. However, all of the studies are based on very-high resolution satellite images, and surprisingly; none of them are implemented on medium resolution satellite images. Moreover, no research has applied geoinformatics knowledge. Therefore, we purpose to compare the semantic segmentation models, which are FCN, SegNet, and GSN using medium resolution images from Landsat-8 satellite. In addition, we propose a modified SegNet model that can be used with remote sensing derived indices. The results show that the model that achieves the highest accuracy RGB bands of medium resolution aerial imagery is SegNet. The overall accuracy of the model increases when includes Near Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) band. The results showed that our proposed method (our modified SegNet model, named RGB-IR-IDX-MSN method) outperforms all of the baselines in terms of mean F1 scores."
"Enhance Accuracy of Hierarchical Text Categorization Based on Deep Learning Network Using Embedding Strategies  2018 IEEE.Hierarchical text categorization is a task that aims to assign predefined categories to text documents with hierarchical constraint. Recently, deep learning techniques has shown many success results in various fields, especially, in text categorization. In our previous work called Shared Hidden Layer Neural Network (SHL-NN), it has shown that sharing information between levels can improve a performance of the model. However, this work is based on a sequence of unsupervised word embedding vectors, so the performance should be limited. In this paper, we propose a supervised document embedding specifically designed for hierarchical text categorization based on Autoencoder, which is trained from both words and labels. To enhance the embedding vectors, the document embedding strategies are invented to utilize the class hierarchy information in the training process. To transfer the prediction result from the parent classes, the shared information technique has been improved to be more flexible and efficient. The experiment was conducted on three standard benchmarks: WIPO-C, WIPO-D and Wiki comparing to two baselines: SHL-NN and a top-down based SVM framework with TF-IDF inputs called 'HR-SVM.' The results show that the proposed model outperforms all baselines in terms of F1 macro."
"Algorithmic Music Composition Comparison  2018 IEEE.This paper presents the application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithm as an algorithmic music composer, compared to a rule-based algorithm. The ML model is based on LSTMs which takes in previous notes and predicts the next set of notes based on a midi format. For the rule-based method, we apply chord progression rules and binary rhythm pattern theory. We used both algorithms to generate music in two different genres, namely rock, and jazz. To evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms, fifteen raters are asked to identify the genre of the generated songs. The results showed 77.33% of the rulebased algorithms Jazz songs were correctly identified, compared to the 62.67% generated by the LSTM. For the rock genre, only 49.33% percent of rule-based algorithms songs and 44% Machine Learning algorithms songs were correctly identified. In terms of music satisfaction, the rule-based algorithm on average obtains higher scores in both genres, 2.17 for Jazz and 2.42 for Rock while Machine Learning algorithm receives 1.83 for Jazz songs and 1.57 for Rock."
"Log-End Cut-Area Detection in Images Taken from Rear End of Eucalyptus Timber Trucks  2018 IEEE.The visual estimation of log volume and size distribution of eucalyptus logs on a truck is a challenging task. In Thailand, inspectors at paper mills typically perform this task. The information is used to determine whether the logs pass the criteria for the mill and to find the appropriate price. This method is far from accurate and not efficient. This paper presents a new approach to automatically detects eucalyptus logend cut area from rear-end images of eucalyptus timber trucks. The method used machine learning and image processing techniques. It consists of three parts: timber truck detection, log segmentation, and log counting. The proposed system was tested with 300 images of timber truck dataset and achieved an average accuracy of 94.45% in log segmentation and 2.71% of false negative."
"Enhance Machine Reading Comprehension on Multiple Sentence Questions with Gated and Dense Coreference Information  2018 IEEE.Machine reading comprehension (MC) is one of the most important problems in natural language processing. Most of the previous works rely heavily on features engineering and handcrafting techniques. Since the release of SQuAD, a large-scale MC dataset, many deep learning models have been proposed. However, these models are limited by the soft attention mechanism only relied on keywords that appears in a question. Therefore, the performance is always poor in a question that needs to infer an answer from multiple sentences, which cannot depend on keywords in a question. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that incorporates coreference information to improve the prediction performance especially on multiple sentence question. We also propose the bi-directional answering technique that can help the model avoid a local maxima of the single directional answering method in a traditional model. The results have shown that our approach outperforms the baseline in terms of F1 and Exact Match (EM)."
"Exploiting Building Blocks in Hard Problems with Modified Compact Genetic Algorithm  2018 IEEE.In Evolutionary Computation, good substructures that are combined into good solutions are called building blocks. In this context, building blocks are common structure of high- quality solutions. The compact genetic algorithm is an extension of the genetic algorithm that replaces the latter's population of chromosomes with a probability distribution from which candidate solutions can be generated. This paper describes an algorithm that exploits building blocks with compact genetic algorithm in order to solve difficult optimization problems under the assumption that we have already known building blocks. The main idea is to update the probability vectors as a group of bits that represents building blocks thus avoiding the disruption of the building blocks. Comparisons of the new algorithm with a conventional compact genetic algorithm on trap-function and traveling salesman problems indicate the utility of the proposed algorithm. It is most effective when the problem instants have common structures that can be identify as building blocks."
"Development of Low-Cost in-the-Ear EEG Prototype  2018 IEEE.This study focused on building a low-cost wearable EEG device multiple hour usage. The device suitable for long period monitoring is in-the-ear EEG, which has desirable wearable characteristics. With electrode in an earbud, it is relatively simple to install and wear. The in-the-ear prototype in this study was built from earphone rubber as an earpiece and silver-adhesive fabric as electrodes. Raw materials cost 3 dollar per piece. The impedance measurement from in-the-ear EEG is comparable to those of commercial electrodes. Signal verifications were conducted by teeth clenching, ASSR, MMN, and correlation. The signal verification results show that there is a strong correlation between in-the-ear EEG and T7/T8 signals. (γ-coefficient = 0.912)"

"16S metagenomic analysis reveals adaptability of a mixed-PAH-degrading consortium isolated from crude oil-contaminated seawater to changing environmental conditions  2018 Elsevier B.V.A bacterial consortium, named SWO, was enriched from crude oil-contaminated seawater from Phrao Bay in Rayong Province, Thailand, after a large oil spill in 2013. The bacterial consortium degraded a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mixture consisting of phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene (50 mg L−1 each) by approximately 73%, 69%, 52%, and 48%, respectively, within 21 days. This consortium exhibited excellent adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions. It could degrade a mixture of four PAHs under a range of pH values (4.0–9.0), temperatures (25 °C–37 °C), and salinities (0–10 g L−1 with NaCl). In addition, this consortium degraded 20–30% of benzo[a]pyrene and perylene (10 mg L−1 each), high molecular weight PAHs, in the presence of other PAHs within 35 days, and degraded 40% of 2% (v/v) crude oil within 20 days. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis demonstrated that Pseudomonas and Methylophaga were the dominant genera of consortium SWO in almost all treatments, while Pseudidiomarina, Thalassospira and Alcanivorax were predominant under higher salt concentrations. Moreover, Pseudomonas and Alcanivorax were dominant in the crude oil-degradation treatment. Our results suggest that the consortium SWO maintained its biodegradation ability by altering the bacterial community profile upon encountering changes in the environmental conditions."
"The effect of vitamin D2 supplementation on muscle strength in early postmenopausal women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial  2018,  2018 International Menopause Society.Background: Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been shown to be associated with low muscle mass and loss of muscle strength, resulting in increased disability and frailty in older men and women. Vitamin D deficiency is common in postmenopausal women. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength in early postmenopausal women. The effects of vitamin D2 supplementation on muscle mass and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) were secondarily investigated. Methods: A 12-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in early postmenopausal women (45–60 years old) with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml). A total of 88 subjects were randomized into group I: vitamin D2 supplement 40 000 IU/week (n = 44), or group II: placebo (n = 44). Serum 25(OH)D level, muscle strength, muscle mass and muscle CSA were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks after the supplementation. Results: After 12 weeks of supplementation, 70% of women in group I achieved a sufficient level of serum 25(OH)D (>30 ng/ml). There were significant differences in changes of serum 25(OH)D levels between the two groups (p < 0.05). Muscle strength and muscle CSA in group I increased significantly after 12 weeks (p = 0.015, 0.045, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in the mean changes of muscle strength, muscle mass and muscle CSA between the two groups (p = 0.16, 0.89, 0.84, respectively). Conclusion: In this study, we found no obvious effect of vitamin D supplementation on the changes in muscle strength, muscle mass and muscle CSA when compared to placebo. However, there were significant changes in muscle strength and muscle CSA from baseline in the vitamin D supplementation group."
"Changes in hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence in medical students in Bangkok, Thailand, from 1981 to 2016  2018 The Author(s).Objective: This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG in Thai medical students in 2016 compared with the previous data and to demonstrate the cross-effective strategy to screen HAV seropositivity. Results: Sera from 176 first-year medical students (age 19.07 ± 0.59 years; 50% female) at a university hospital in Thailand were tested for anti-HAV IgG. Data from HAV vaccination records and questionnaires were also collected. HAV seropositivity was unexpectedly high (62.5%, n = 110). 37.5% (n = 66) had an HAV vaccination record. Of these, 60.6% received the full HAV vaccination series, 4.5% received one HAV vaccination, 34.8% did not receive HAV vaccination, and 3.0% had natural HAV immunity. The long-term efficacy of HAV vaccination was at least 97.5% over a mean of 15.55 ± 2.44 years. There was a significant difference in immunity between students with (66.7%) and without (50.9%) vaccination records (P = 0.028). Most of the student's parents had a bachelor's degree or higher (87.9%; n = 272) and above average income (mean 17,000.76 ± 194.22 USD/person/year). Parental education and socioeconomic status influenced vaccination accessibility in these medical students. Screening of vaccination records instead of routine anti-HAV IgG testing is a cost-effective and reliable strategy to determine HAV immunity in medical students in Thailand."
"Evaluation of static capacity of piles from rapid load testing  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The unloading point method (ULM) is a simple technique for determining equivalent static load-settlement behaviour of piles from rapid load tests. Since the ULM assumes piles to be rigid, it does not consider the effects of elastic shortening and the lag in response along pile shaft. This assumption can be improved by increasing measurement points, e.g. adding an accelerometer at pile toe. In this article, the stress-wave theory was used instead of the additional sensor for estimating the response at pile toe. By considering the lag in response along pile shaft, a better estimate of the stationary point can be obtained and used in the ULM. The refined ULM was verified by comparing with the non-linear model using rapid load test results in literatures. Predictions by the proposed method agreed well with the results from static pile load tests and were better than other methods in this study."
"Health prospects of older persons in Thailand: the role of education  2018,  2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Thailand’s population is aging rapidly and the number of older adults suffering from health limitations is expected to increase. Making use of several rounds of the Survey of Older Persons, we look at the education-specific prevalences of three health indicators over time and find a positive education gradient for difficulties with ADLs and poor self-rated health, but not for functional limitations. Combining these age-, sex- and education-specific prevalences for each indicator with population projections up to 2050, we see a lower projected number of persons with difficulties with ADLs or bad health as compared to an approach when we only account for differences by age and sex. Still, irrespective of the approach taken, we project a significant increase in the number of persons 50+ that have at least one ADL difficulty, at least one functional limitation or suffer from poor health. Our results provide estimates for future care needs and illustrate the possibly preventive effect of education."

"Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Glaucoma Care  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Purpose: To provide the reader with information on the principal techniques of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA); the current literature on OCTA reproducibility; its applications to glaucoma detection and monitoring of progression; and the role of OCTA in the assessment of the vascular component in glaucoma pathogenesis.Methods: A literature review of the pertinent publications for the OCTA in relation to the development, techniques, and its use in glaucoma was carried out.Results: Rapid improvements in optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology have allowed for enhancement of both image resolution and scanning speed, and the development of vascular assessment modality. OCTA is the non-invasive in vivo imaging of the vasculature located within the retina and optic nerve head area. The principle of OCTA is to use the variations in OCT signals caused by moving particles as the contrast mechanism for imaging of flow. Several algorithms which aim to maximize the contrast signal and minimize the noise have been developed including the phase-based techniques, intensity-based techniques (e.g., split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA)), and complex-based techniques (e.g., optical microangiography (OMAG)). With its reliable technique, high image resolution, and current availability, OCTA has been widely used in the assessment of posterior segment diseases including glaucoma in which ocular perfusion dysfunction has been proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism.Conclusion: OCTA may enhance our knowledge of glaucoma pathogenesis and offer an improvement in our ability to detect glaucomatous change."
"Comparison of different kraft lignin-based vanillin production processes  2018 Elsevier LtdThis work employed a systematic methodology and process intensification concepts to improve the state-of-the-art vanillin production process from kraft lignin. Particular focus was put on the use of different product separation techniques, including solvent extraction using ethyl acetate, benzene, organic nanofiltration, and adsorption by zeolite. The performance of each proposed process was evaluated in terms of energy consumption, process economics, and environmental impacts. Simulation of the vanillin production processes was performed using the Aspen Plus program while the economic and environmental analyses were conducted using economic analysis tools and LCSoft, respectively. The results revealed that the process using adsorption by zeolite is the best alternative. It offered a slight improvement in energy consumption while its economic result showed 7.37% improvement. It also caused the least environmental impact in all categories."

"Emerging infectious disease from bats  2018, Chiang Mai University - Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. All rights reserved.Emerging infectious diseases and re-emerging diseases are defined as new diseases occurred in normal population, or known diseases with dramatically increase in incident rate. Since 1940, there are numerous occurrences of EIDs; most are caused by viruses and most are zoonotic diseases, such as, Ebola diseases, HIV infection, SARS and MERS. Many of the viruses causing these diseases are previously believed to be originating from different kinds of animals. But further studies showed that those viruses actually came from different species of bats. These discoveries essentially transformed bats into one of the most interesting subject of research regarding their unique abilities to carry and transmit diseases, as well as the types of viruses they hold. Present and upcoming studies regarding bats and the diseases they carry should be collected to form a global database, which would be used to further create preventive strategies, surveillance programs, and rapid re-sponses to potential EIDs in the future."
"Effect of fertilizer type on cyanide, manganese, and arsenic phytoremediation in tailings from gold mining  2018, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.This study investigated the effects of using chemical and organic fertilizer on arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), and cyanide (CN) absorption in tailings from a gold-mining tailing storage facility (TSF) by growing plants in a nursery. The experimental sets were prepared and classified into two sets: the first set used 15-15-15 chemical fertilizer, and the second set used organic fertilizer (manure). Two groups of plants were grown; the first group was comprised of monocot species, which were V. nemoralis and B. bambos, and the second group was comprised of dicot species, which were A. mangium and L. leucocephala. Plants and tailing samples were collected every 30 days during the six-month experiment. Growth was examined, and the absorption and accumulated amounts of As, Mn, and CN in the plant parts were analyzed. The findings showed that the accumulated amounts of As, Mn, and CN decreased when the experimental period increased. The accumulated amounts of As, Mn, and CN in the parts of experimental plants at 180 days indicated that V. nemoralis and A. mangium fertilized with chemical fertilizer (mass balance calculation) had higher rates of As, Mn, and CN absorption than those in the sets fertilized with organic fertilizer. V. nemoralis accumulated the most As and Mn in the underground part (roots), with values of 7.07 and 17.03 mg/kg, respectively, and absorbed the most CN in the aboveground part (shoots and leaves), with a value of 6.43 mg/kg. A. mangium absorbed the most As and Mn in leaves, with values of 5.64 and 40.51 mg/kg, respectively, and absorbed the most CN in shoots, with a value of 0.24 mg/kg. Therefore, it could be concluded that A. mangium (dicot species) and V. nemoralis (monocot species) had a high ability and potential to absorb toxicity or reduce the accumulated amounts of heavy metal. Furthermore, A. mangium and V. nemoralis would be suitable for application per relevant guidelines to solve the problem of As, Mn, and CN contaminated soil in other regions."
"Ticagrelor induces paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and better protects hypercholesterolemic mice against atherosclerosis compared to clopidogrel This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose. The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication.Ticagrelor (TIC), a P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12)-receptor antagonist, has been widely used to treat patients with acute coronary syndrome. Although animal studies suggest that TIC protects against atherosclerosis, it remains unknown whether it does so through its potent platelet inhibition or through other pathways. Here, we placed hypercholesterolemic Ldlr-/-A-pobec1-/- mice on a high-fat diet and treated them with either 25 mg/kg/day of clopidogrel (CLO) or 180 mg/kg/day of TIC for 16 weeks and evaluated the extent of atherosclerosis. Both treatments equally inhibited platelets as determined by ex vivo platelet aggregation assays. The extent of atherosclerosis, however, was significantly less in the TIC group than in the CLO group. Immunohistochemical staining and ELISA showed that TIC treatment was associated with less macrophage infiltration to the atherosclerotic intima and lower serum levels of CCL4, CXCL10, and TNFα, respectively, than CLO treatment. Treatment with TIC, but not CLO, was associated with higher serum activity and tissue level of paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an anti-atherosclerotic molecule, suggesting that TIC might exert greater anti-atherosclerotic activity, compared with CLO, through its unique ability to induce PON1. Although further studies are needed, TIC may prove to be a viable strategy in the prevention and treatment of chronic stable human atherosclerosis."
"Analysis and probabilistic risk assessment of bioaccessible arsenic in polished and husked jasmine rice sold in Bangkok  2018 Elsevier LtdFood is one of the major sources of arsenic (As) exposure in humans. The objectives of this study were to determine the bioaccessible concentration of As in rice grain sold in Bangkok and to evaluate the potential health risks associated with rice consumption. Polished (n = 32) and husked (n = 17) jasmine rice were collected from local markets. In vitro digestion was performed to determine the bioaccessible As concentrations, which were used for probabilistic health risk assessments in different age groups of the population. Approximately 43.0% and 44.4% of the total As in the grain of polished and husked rice, respectively, was in the form of bioaccessible As. Significantly higher bioaccessible As concentrations were found in husked rice than in polished rice (1.5–3.8 times greater). The concentrations of bioaccessible As in polished and husked rice were lower than the Codex standard for As in rice. The average daily dose of As via rice consumption is equivalent to the daily ingestion of 2 L of water containing approximately 3.2–7.2 μg L−1 of As. Approximately 0.2%–13.7% and 10.7%–55.3% of the population may experience non-carcinogenic effects from polished and husked rice consumption, respectively. Approximately 1%–11.6% of children and 74.1%–99.8% of adults were at risk of cancer. The maximum cancer probabilities were 3 children and 6 adults in 10,000 individuals. The probabilistic risk results indicated that children and adults were at risk of both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects from both types of rice consumption."
"Dependency types validation of precedence diagram method using ontology  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) is a visual representation technique that depicts the activities involved in a project. It is a tool for scheduling activities using nodes to represent activities and their connections with arrows to illustrate activity dependencies. During project execution, activities in the project may be considered to change and may lead to inconsistency of dependency types. Consequently, dates and deadlines are missed so these mistakes could prove very costly. Since an ontology describes the relationship between the concepts within a domain. Thus, the ontology could be used to represent knowledge of PDM. This paper proposes PDM Ontology in OWL and rules for inferring the new knowledge from existing PDM and validating PDM using SWRL."
"Topographic anatomy of the infraorbital artery and its clinical implications for nasolabial fold augmentation Copyright  2018 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.Background: Understanding the topography of the blood vessels distributed around the nasolabial fold region is essential for ensuring the safety of dermal filler injections into the nasolabial fold. The purpose of this study was to provide anatomical information on the infraorbital artery distribution and its relationship with the facial artery for use in clinical procedures involving filler injection during nasolabial fold augmentation. Methods: The infraorbital artery was investigated in the nasolabial fold region divided into zones I to XII based on clock-hour meridians centered on the infraorbital foramen. The running layers of the infraorbital artery and infraorbital nerve were also compared in the infraorbital foramen. Changes in the infraorbital artery were observed according to vascular dominance of the facial artery. Results: The infraorbital artery was divided into three main branches, palpebral, nasal, and labial infraorbital artery branches in 34.7, 100, and 100 percent of the specimens, respectively; with these branches of palpebral, nasal, and labial infraorbital artery observed most commonly in zones I, V, and VI, respectively. Analysis of the bilateral facial artery topography revealed that its vascular dominance was observed in 19.4 percent. The infraorbital artery was thicker and had a wider distribution on the nondominant side of the facial artery, whereas the nasal infraorbital nerve anastomosed with the facial artery in the lateral nasal region in 57.1 percent. Conclusion: Investigating and verifying the vascular structure regarding its interactions with the facial artery and infraorbital artery will provide critical information to physicians performing facial surgery and cosmetic procedures."
"Arthroscopic Decompression of Spinoglenoid Notch Cyst and SLAP Repair Through a Single Working Portal  2018 Arthroscopy Association of North AmericaA SLAP lesion can be found with a concomitant spinoglenoid notch cyst. The cyst can cause suprascapular nerve compression, resulting in shoulder pain and weakness of external rotation. Their management varies from conservative treatment to operative treatment. Cyst decompression through the labral tear is our preferred treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a good result after arthroscopic decompression of the cyst through the labral tear combined with SLAP repair. Many surgeons usually use 3 portals to perform this procedure. However, we prefer to use only 2 portals, 1 anterior viewing portal and 1 posterior working portal. This strategy is more time and cost efficient. The patient is positioned in lateral decubitus. The SLAP lesion is demonstrated by using a probe. Tissue elevator is inserted into the labral lesion to penetrate into the cyst wall. A soft anchor is placed. A birdbeak suture passer penetrates the posterior labrum. Then knot tying is done. The advantages of this single working portal technique are short operative time, a decreased risk of iatrogenic rotator cuff injury from accessory anterolateral portal or posterior labral injury from posterolateral portal, and avoiding unnecessary superior capsule incision for cyst exposure."
"Emission intensity and abatement cost of fossil fuel power plants in Thailand  2018, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania. All rights reserved.Monitoring of air emission and pollution control cost is a key to improve air quality management of electricity generation industry. This research comprehensively evaluates abatement cost of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), emission intensity and emission inventory of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from Thailand’s fossil fuel power plants. The research applied bottom-up approach with continuously monitored data from 64 percent of Thailand electricity generation industry. The data was used in an evaluation of emission intensity according to technology, fuel type and pollution control system. The research finding indicates that lignite-fired power plants are the major contributors of air pollution in Thailand. The research results will help in improving performance of emission forecast and monitoring via usage of site-specific emission factors. Air emission factors from power plants were found to be 0.022 – 1.432 g-SO2/kWh, 0.122 – 5.229 g-NOx/kWh, 0.031 g-PM/kWh, and 452 – 1,443 g-CO2/kWh. The cost for SO2 reduction from fossil fuel-based power plants are estimated to be 0.03-0.26 US$/Kg-SO2 while abatement costs of NOx are 0.31-9.63 US$/kg-NOx. Flue gas desulfurization with wet lime and dry low-NOx burner are more efficient and cost-effective in controlling SO2 and NOx than the other techniques. The research results were also benchmarked against available international data sources. The findings can be used in policy planning and decision making process of key stakeholders to help improve air quality in the future."
"Health status in wild and captive short mackerel, Rastrelliger brachysoma from Thailand: Histopathology  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.Information regarding the health status of wild and captive Rastrelliger brachysoma (Bleeker, 1851) is scanty. This is an economically/ ecologically important fish species in Thailand which has experienced recent dramatic declines in population numbers. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the health status of this fish using histopathology as biomarker. The results revealed previously the gill lesions including lamellae disorganization, fusion and edema with lifting of lamellar epithelium in the secondary lamellae. The skin histopathology included epidermal hyperplasia and the proliferation of the Malpighian cells. Pyknotic nuclei and vacuolar degeneration of exocrine acinar cells were detected in the pancreas tissue. Degeneration of the renal parenchyma and tubules as well as the melanomacrophage center (MMC) was observed in kidney tissue. In captive fish, the most common histopathology of gill tissue, primary lamellae disorganization and degeneration of secondary gills, was observed in all samples. In some areas of the kidney tissues, renal degeneration and damage to the glomeruli throughout the majority of the macrophage aggregates (MMC) were also found. Important histopathological observations of liver tissue were hepatic degeneration, focal coagulation necrosis and increased frequency of MMC. Interestingly, a gastric tumor was observed in only one male specimen. Additionally, it must be emphasized that histopathological alterations are an effective biomarker used to evaluate potential effects of the environmental pollution on fish health and marine biota."
"Predicting the duration of antimalarial treatment with heme degradation inhibitors of blood schizonticides using mathematical models  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.A mathematical model of the death rate of malaria parasite due to the antimalarial drugs is established in this paper to predict the treatment duration and the drug dosage. This model is based on probabilities, pharmacokinetics and pharma-codynamics (PK/PD), biology, medical sciences, theoretical physics and chemistry. The death rate of malaria parasite is derived from the flow rates of drug molecules to the malaria parasite by using the theory of blood convection and probabilities. Using the malaria model, numerical results are generated. In conclusion, the numerical estimate of treatment duration from our model ranges from 1 to 10 days, conforming to actual clinical data."
"Dual-band infrared video-based measurement using pulse wave maps to analyze heart rate variability  2018 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables us to capture the vital signs such as pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and even heart rate variability (HRV) without any contact devises. Although the papers of rPPG mainly focus on the use of standard RGB camera, it cannot used for the cases in night or under the dim light conditions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel noncontact method for monitoring HRV without visible lighting. The proposed method uses dual-band infrared videos to ensure robustness to fluctuations in illumination. The hemoglobin component is extracted via a simple projection from the dual-band pixel values in logarithmic space. We demonstrate the accurate extraction of pulse wave signals using pulse wave maps. As the results, we indicated the effectiveness of HRV monitoring in the situation under the dim light condition."
"Current status of GI endoscopy in Thailand and Thai Association of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (TAGE)  2018 Siriraj Medical Journal.Endoscopy practice in Thailand is being performed and serviced by both surgeons and gastroenterologists.

"Impact of testicular shielding in liposarcoma to scrotum by using radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeter (Rplgd): A case report  2018. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.Radiation protection in the scrotum to reduce the risk of genetic effect in the future is very important. This study aimed to measure the scrotal dose outside the treatment fields by using the radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeter (RPLGD). The characteristics of RPLGD model GD-302M were studied. Scattered dose to scrotum was measured in one liposarcoma case with the prescribed dose of 60 Gy. RPLGDs were placed in three different locations: one RPLGD was positioned at the posterior area which closer to the scrotum, and the other two RPLGDs were placed between the penis and the scrotum. Three RPLGDs were employed in each location. The scattered doses were measured in every fraction during the whole course of treatment. The entire number of 100 RPLGDs showed the uniformity within ±2%. The signal from RPLGD demonstrated linear proportion to the radiation dose (r = 0.999). The relative energy response correction factor was 1.05. The average scrotal dose was 4.1 ± 0.9 cGy per fraction. The results presented a wide range since there was a high uncertainty during RPLGD placement. The total scrotal dose for the whole course of treatment was 101.9 cGy (1.7% of the prescribed dose). The RPLGD model GD-302M could be used to measure scattered dose after applying the relative energy correction factor."
"Thermal behaviour of calcite-structure carbonates: A powder x-ray diffraction study between 83 and 618 k  2018 E. Schweizerbart’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, D-70176 Stuttgart.The thermal behaviour of five calcite-structure carbonates (space group R-3c), magnesite (MgCO3), smithsonite (ZnCO3), rhodochrosite (MnCO3), otavite (CdCO3) and calcite (CaCO3), was explored by in situ powder X-ray diffraction over the temperature range 83–618 K. The unit-cell and crystal-structure parameters relative to temperature in theses carbonates were determined. All the carbonates in this study display obvious anisotropic thermal expansion: the values of the thermal expansion coefficients along the c-axis (a0(c)) are much larger than those along the a-axis (a0(a)). The a cell parameter of otavite increases slightly from 123 to 223 K and subsequently contracts at higher temperature. Negative thermal expansion along the a-axis is also observed in calcite. In contrast to those of magnesite and smithsonite, the O1–O2 bond distances of otavite and calcite do not expand with increasing temperature, which may explain their negative thermal expansion along the a-axis. Moreover, the values of a0(V) and a0(a) for the calcite-structure carbonates (MgCO3, ZnCO3, MnCO3, CdCO3, and CaCO3) are shown to exhibit an inverse correlation with the cation radius. However, no obvious relationship is noted between the a0(c) values and the size of the cations. Structural mechanisms for the systematic thermal behaviour of the five carbonates are also discussed."

"Characterization of 30 selected Jasminum accessions in Thailand based on microscopic and RAPD fingerprinting  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.Jasminum (family Oleaceae) have a long history usage in traditional medicine, perfumery and flavoring tea. Jasminum species possess their similar morphology and vernacular name resulting in unintentional substitution. Characterization plays an important role for herbal usage. Since microscopic characteristics as well as genetic relationship assessments of Jasminum accessions are still limited. Thirty Jasminum accessions obtained from 3 different locations in Thailand (n=90) were evaluated for their microscopic leaf measurements (stomata number, stomata index, palisade ratio, epidermal cell number, epidermal cell area, vein termination number, vein islet number and trichome number) under microscope as well as RAPD fingerprinting. Individual sample established their microscopic characteristics and several microscopic parameters can be used for characterization and identification. Combination of several microscopic characteristics and morphology could provide more accurate data for identification of 30 Jasminum accessions. When consideration their phylogenetic relationship among 30 Jasminum accessions, RAPD marker amplified the reproducible 217 bands among these, 155 bands (71.43%) were found to be polymorphic. The similarity index ranging from 0.022-0.477 indicated their genetic diversity. A dendrogram constructed according to the UPGMA cluster analysis could be divided 30 Jasminum accessions into 3 main clusters. In conclusion, microscopic characteristics and RAPD fingerprinting can be used to characterize 30 Jasminum accessions. The phylogenetic relationship was not associated with their botanical characteristics. The data obtained from this study could be helpful for accurate identification of medicinal plants for their safety and efficacy usage."
"Hollow-fiber microextraction combined with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography mass spectrometry for analytical determination of high polarity herbicides in water  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.A hollow-fiber microextraction (HF-LPME) method was developed for the extraction of four high polarity herbicides (paraquat, diquat, chlormequat, and mepiquat) prior to the analysis by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The miniature extraction system was constructed from a single piece of hollow fiber membrane. Di-(2-ethyl hexyl)phosphoric acid in di-n-hexyl ether was used as membrane supporting liquid. Samples were adjusted to pH 5.0 by a phosphate buffer, and the acceptor solution was HCl pH 0.5. The extracted herbicides were separated on a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic column within 5 minutes using isocratic elution of 10 mM ammonium formate:acetonitrile (50:50). The factors affecting the extraction efficiency were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the enrichment factors were in the range of 49-476. Excellent linear dynamic range was observed from 2-180 μg/L with correlation coefficients (R2) better than 0.997. Method detection limits were 0.04-0.13 μg/L which are better than values published in the U.S. EPA method 549.2-1. The procedure was validated and tested on water, and rice samples with good success. The method was accurate with recoveries ranging from 71.6 to 78.7%. Good intra-precision and intermediate precision were obtained with RSD lower than 11%."
"The expression of kisspeptin and its receptor in the domestic cat ovary and uterus in different stages of the ovarian cycle  2018 Elsevier Inc.Kisspeptin is well known for its indispensable role in the regulation of reproduction, mainly through controlling the release of GnRH at the hypothalamic level. Recent studies have shown that kisspeptin and the kisspeptin receptor are expressed in the ovary and uterus, indicating an additional local function in reproduction at the extra-hypothalamic level. In this study, we aimed: (1) to investigate the localization pattern of kisspeptin and its receptor in the domestic cat ovary and uterus throughout the ovarian cycle using immunohistochemistry; and (2) to compare the relative expression of ovarian Kiss1 mRNA levels at different ovarian stages with qPCR analysis. Ovaries and uteri were collected and classified into three ovarian stages (inactive, follicular and luteal stages (n = 7 in each stage)) according to the ovarian morphology, vaginal cytology and serum progesterone. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity (Kp-IR) and kisspeptin receptor immunoreactivity (KpR-IR) were present in the ovaries and uteri at all ovarian stages, with no notable differences in the localization patterns between the ovarian stages. In the ovary, Kp-IR and KpR-IR were present in various ovarian compartments, including the follicles at all classes and the corpus luteum (CL). In the follicles, Kp-IR and KpR-IR were present in the oocytes, granulosa cells and theca cells. Kp-IR was also detected in the follicular fluid of antral follicles. In CL, a strong intensity of Kp-IR was present in the periphery CL of development/maintenance, with a relatively fainter intensity in the central CL. By contrast, KpR-IR was present in both peripheral and central CL at the same intensity. In the uterus, Kp-IR and KpR-IR were present in the uterine glands, myometrium and perimetrium. The relative ovarian Kiss1 mRNA level was higher in the follicular stage than in the luteal stage (P < 0.05). We concluded that kisspeptin and its receptor are present in the cat ovary and uterus, suggesting possible local functions of kisspeptin at the extra-hypothalamic level, such as folliculogenesis, oocyte survival and uterine adenogenesis."
"Syntheses and UV spectroscopic study of mono-and dialkyloxy-4-methylcoumarins  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.Mono-and dialkyloxy-4-methylcoumarins were successfully synthesized starting from dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarins and an alkyl bromide, butyl bromide or octyl bromide, at 1:1 molar ratio. The alkylation of 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin gave 5,7-dialkyloxy-4-methylcoumarin and two monoalkyloxy-4-methylcoumarins with substitution at 5 and 7 positions. For 6,7-and 7,8-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarins, the corresponding dialkyloxy-4-methylcoumarins and only monoalkyloxy-4-methylcoumarins at the 7 position were obtained. UV absorption studies of the dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarins and their mono-and dialkyloxy products showed a red shift of the maximum absorption wavelengths compared to 4-methylcoumarins. Additionally, substitution of a hydroxyl or alkyloxy group at the 6-position caused a further red shift. The dimerization degree from decreasing of UV absorbance revealed that it depended on the substitution positions. Among all these coumarin derivatives, 5,7-dibutyloxy-4-methylcoumarin exhibited the highest dimerization degree."

"Comparison of GTS and RAPD assays to characterize Thai Mycoplasma gallisepticum strains  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is one of the important pathogens which have economic impact on the poultry industry worldwide. Molecular characterization is the effective method to study the relation among international strains and the epidemiology of MG transmission. In this study, 17 Thai MG strains were characterized by using 2 molecular assays including random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and gene-targeted sequencing (GTS) assays. Results showed that the RAPD assay could classify the Thai MG strains into 3 patterns. Most MG strains obtained from the same area were in the same pattern. Partial mgc2 gene was used to distinguish between the Thai MG strains and MG strains from various countries. The phylogenetic tree of nucleotide sequence of mgc2 gene showed that 11 Thai MG strains had 100% similarity sequence to Indian MG strains and one strain was 100% similar to Israel MG strain. The targeted partial mgc2 gene could characterize the Thai MG strains into 4 groups while the RAPD pattern classified the Thai MG strains into 3 groups. These results provided interesting data about the relation of Thai MG strains and MG strains from other countries. GTS assay might be the new optional assay to monitor MG outbreak in Thailand."

The research focuses on developing self-learning habits by using journals for academic observation and applying theory to practice. Data were collected in mixed-methods from 12 third-year undergraduate art education students in Thailand. Results found that students were effective in observation, comparison and analysis of philosophies of different schools – from art activities, to the physical layout and scheduling of those places visited. The sketchbook aided reflective thinking and utilized many art techniques, highlighting the relationships between content, application of theories, diagramming and mind mapping. Approximately 75 per cent of the experimental group described the content and applied theories in text format and sketches. In addition, students reflected that jotting down content with personal words enhanced their ability for remembering, understanding and applying knowledge. However, some students believed that the RSJ is an important and useful tool that they intended to use again in other disciplines."
"Effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation on cardiac troponin i level, heart rate variability, and echocardiographic profiles in canine with myxomatous degenerative mitral valve disease: A pilot study  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.The clinical benefits of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) have been well documented in heart failure patients. In veterinary medicine, however, the clinical benefits of CoQ10 have not been well established in dogs with heart diseases. This study aimed to determine the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on 1) preventing myocardial injury 2) cardiac function 3) autonomic balance in dogs with myxomatous degenerative mitral valve disease (MMVD). Thirteen dogs with MMVD at ACVIM stage C were recruited in this study. Dogs were further divided into group I (Body weight [BW] < 6 kg.; n = 7) and group II (BW ≥ 6 kg.; n = 6). Cardiac troponin I (cTnI), echocardiographic examination, and 2 hours of Holter recording were performed on Day 0 and after receiving CoQ10 at 100 mg/dog twice daily for 28 days. CoQ10 caused a reduction of cTnI level in 71% of the dogs. Median cTnI tended to cause tended to decline but not significantly. Systolic function [i.e. fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF)] increased significantly by 8 % and 9% (P < 0.05), respectively in group I after CoQ10 supplementation. Other echocardiographic parameters were not altered in either group. HRV analysis revealed no change in autonomic function and balance. cTnI negatively correlated with FS (P < 0.01) and positively correlated with LF/HF ratio (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrated the clinical benefits of CoQ10 supplementation in dogs with MMVD. CoQ10 improves cardiac function in small dogs with MMVD. Finally, supplementation of CoQ10 in dogs should be based on body weight."
"Immunohistochemical staining of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma in normal, benign, and malignant canine mammary tissues  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to nuclear receptor superfamily acting as transcription factors related to lipid and glucose metabolism. There are 3 subtypes including PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ. PPARα and PPARγ activations can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and differentiation in many cell types. However, the expressions of these receptors in canine mammary tissue are still unknown. This study was performed to investigate the expressions of PPARα and PPARγ in normal, benign, and malignant canine mammary tissues. Twenty four bitches at the age of 5-15 years old, which undergone unilateral mastectomy, were used in the study. Mammary tissues were sectioned and histologically diagnosed by H&E staining, 12 were benign and another 12 were malignant. In each dog, tissues were collected from both normal and tumor area. Immunohistochemical staining has demonstrated that both PPARα and PPARγ express mainly in cytoplasm, perinucleolar region, and some nuclei of glandular epithelial cells, ductal epithelial cells, and myoepithelial cells. Lower expression of the receptors were found in fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivities of these receptors were calculated into H-score. H-score of PPARα in benign type and PPARγ in malignant type were significantly higher than in normal tissue (P<0.05). According to the expression of these receptors in normal canine mammary tissue and receptor upregulation in tumor cells suggested that PPARα and PPARγ may play a role in canine mammary gland function and might be related to the pathogenesis or progression of canine mammary gland tumors."
"Novel methods to diagnose pulmonary hypertension in dogs assessed by thoracic radiography  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.The objective of this retrospective study was to distinguish between dogs with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and non-PH by using parameters obtained from thoracic radiographs. Data of 72 dogs of small breeds aged more than 1 year old and weighing less than 10 kg were retrieved. Echocardiography was used as a gold standard to diagnose PH and separate the dogs into two groups: PH (n=15) and non-PH (n=57). Seven formulae were created from measurements on right lateral and ventrodorsal radiographic views. Five formulae from the ventrodorsal view provided an outcome that could differentiate PH and non-PH dogs. Two formulae are recommended including 1) the ratio of the area of the pulmonary artery crossing the 9th rib and the area of the 9th thoracic vertebra (areaPA/areaT9) (cut-off >0.08; sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 89.4%) and 2) the ratio of the width of the pulmonary artery crossing the 9th rib and the width of the 9th thoracic vertebra (widthPA/widthT9) (cut-off >0.3; sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 78.9%). Both measurement criteria provided high negative predictive values with moderate positive predictive values. In conclusion, these two new formulae can be used as a screening tool for distinguishing between PH and non-PH in dogs."
"Prevalence and risk factors for canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome in Thailand  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) is a disease similar to Alzheimer's in humans. This progressive neurodegenerative disease affects senior dogs, causes many behavioral changes and decreases welfare in both the dog and owner. Even with its high impact, many studies have shown CDS is underdiagnosed. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of CDS in Thailand and to identify its risk factors. In this study, 622 senior dogs (seven years old and older) were randomly recruited. After an initial interview, 389 dogs were excluded from the study due to clinical and/or sensory impairment. Owners of the remaining dogs (233 dogs) completed a questionnaire that listed behavior related to CDS. Behavior was grouped by category: Disorientation, interaction, sleep-wake cycle and activity and house soiling. Consequently, 122 dogs (52.4%) showed signs consistent with CDS. The percentage of dogs with CDS signs significantly increased with age and neutered dogs had a 2.3 fold higher odds of developing CDS than intact dogs. Sex and body weight/size did not significantly correlate with cognitive decline. The study also revealed sleep-wake cycle and activity was the most impaired behavior category. Only 30 % of the owners of dogs in the study were aware of CDS. Our study concluded that advanced age and reproductive status were the most obvious risk factors. The prevalence of CDS reported here was similar to that in previously reported findings. The questionnaire can be useful in screening for CDS. However, definitive CDS diagnosis requires observation and detailed owner feedback."
"Decreasing duration of androgenic hormone feeding supplement for production of male monosex in tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) fry  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.The effects of an exogenous androgenic hormone on sex differentiation were examined in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and red tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) fry. Tilapia aquaculture in Thailand commonly applies methyltestosterone at the dose of 80 mg/kg diet on the first feeding of fish fry for 21-28 days to achieve male-monosex crop. In this study, male sex reversal was induced with an alternative androgenic hormone, 17á-methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT), at a dose of 80 mg/kg diet for shorter periods; 5, 10, 15, or 20 days. Microscopic examination of fish gonad stained with aceto-carmine was used to determine male and female fish fry at 60 days post hatching (dph). Feeding supplementation with MDHT for up to 15 days yielded 100% male (n=100), while treatment for 5 and 10 days presented 87% and 90% male in Nile tilapia, and 82% and 88% in red tilapia, respectively. Histological examinations of the hormone-treated fish revealed normal microscopic morphology of tilapia gonadal tissues. In addition, analysis of total weight gain and body length among the fish fry showed no significant difference between the treatment groups and the control fish fed on basal diet. The present study demonstrated male sex reversal in tilapia fry with a decreased hormonal feeding to a 15-day period, while maintaining successful male-monosex and having no adverse effect on general fish growth."
"The effects of submaximal exercise training on cardiovascular functions and physical capacity in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), an important disease in senile small breed dogs, leads to deterioration of cardiovascular function and impairment of functional capacity resulting in poor quality of life. Submaximal treadmill running has been used as both cardiovascular training and testing worldwide in humans and recently in animals. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of submaximal endurance training (ET) by treadmill running on safety, adverse events, cardiovascular adaptations, hematology, functional capacity, and the feasibility of submaximal treadmill running test and 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) in dogs with MMVD. Six adult beagle dogs with MMVD, stage B1 according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guideline, were examined before the study, at weeks 4 and 8 of the ET. The cardiovascular functions assessed by echocardiography and electrocardiography, systolic blood pressure, hematology and blood chemistry profiles, and functional capacity were determined. All dogs completed all tests and ET sessions without clinical complication. ET resulted in significant improvement in physical capacity measured by submaximal treadmill running test and 6-MWT, while cardiac function parameters were not altered. Moreover, serum creatinine was significantly decreased. In conclusion, ET and submaximal exercise tests are clinically feasible. The ET can improve physical capacity in dogs with MMVD, stage B1. Therefore, supervised moderate ET and submaximal exercise tests should be incorporated in MMVD management."
"Evaluation of a commercial ELISA test kit on classical swine fever antibody detection using oral fluid samples  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) contributes to economic loss of swine production in endemic countries. Serum neutralization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are serological tests commonly used for monitoring CSFV antibody status with serum samples. This experiment evaluated the detection of CSFV antibody in oral fluid samples in commercial ELISA test kit by in vitro study of negative oral fluid mixed with serum of known CSFV serum neutralizing (SN) titer and in vivo oral fluid samples obtained from experimental animals. Correlations of SN titer and S/P ratio of ELISA were observed with the in vitro oral fluid samples, indicating the stability of the antibody in the oral fluid and the potential of oral fluid as an alternative specimen for CSFV diagnosis. Diagnostic sensitivity of the oral fluid detection using in vitro samples was as high as 95.83% when the ELISA procedures were modified (i.e. 12 h incubation at 4°C and addition of 100 ìl antibody conjugate). The in vivo experiment used oral fluid and blood samples obtained from 20 piglets (20 days old) which were divided into 3 experimental groups: Challenged with ALD strain, low virulence CSFV (A) (n=8); vaccinated (B) (n=8); and negative control (C) (n=4). The animals were vaccinated with CSFV LOM strain modified live vaccine at 0 day post inoculation (dpi) and re-challenged (A&B) with high virulence CSFV on 14 dpi and later euthanized at 30 dpi. Results from the in vivo oral fluid samples demonstrated low detectable antibody titers (SN titer 0-4) using neutralizing peroxidase-linked assay (NPLA) and all samples were negative to CSFV indirect ELISA performed at the optimal condition obtained from the in vitro protocol."
"E-cadherin localization in oviduct and uterine horn of swamp buffalo during estrous cycle  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the localization of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) in the oviduct and uterine horn of swamp buffalo at the follicular and mid-luteal phases. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein which plays a vital role in the mechanism of the maintenance epithelial architecture, cell growth and proliferation, cell to cell adhesion including cell to epithelium adhesion. Female reproductive tracts of swamp buffaloes (n=30) were collected from local abattoirs and categorized into follicular (n=15) and mid-luteal (n=15) phases. Tissue samples from the oviducts and uterine horns were regularly handled according to histological and immunohistochemical techniques. The results established that E-cadherin localization was detected in the surface epithelium of uterotubal-junction (UTJ) and isthmus of the oviducts and strong intensity was significantly observed (P<0.05) in the follicular phase compared to the mid-luteal phase. In the uterine horns, E-cadherin was found in the endometrial and glandular epithelium of superficial and deep endometrial glands during both phases of the estrous cycle. However, difference in the immunostaining intensity in the uterine tissues was not found between estrous phases. The current findings indicate that the existence of E-cadherin in the UTJ and isthmus, called sperm reservoir, might function with other molecular substances that appear in this region to regulate the adhesion and release of spermatozoa. In addition, E-cadherin in the endometrial and glandular epithelium is associated with the major preparation of the maintenance of epithelial cell architecture including cell growth and proliferation in uterine horn before blastocyst hatching during implantation period."
"Therapeutic use of sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim for control of Streptococcus agalactiae infection in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fry  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.The therapeutic efficacy of sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim (SDMX-OMP) against Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) infection in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was examined in tilapia fry. Fish (3+0.44 g) underwent 3-hour immersion challenge with 50% infective dose (2.58 x 106 CFU/ml) of S. agalactiae and were treated at 24 hours post challenge with daily dosages of 30 and 50 mg SDMX-OMP/kg body weight (BW) feeding medication for 7 days. The administration of medicated feed increased the survival of the infected tilapia fry. The survival rate of the challenged, non-medicated group was 51.25+4.79%. The fish which were challenged with S. agalactiae and received the 30 and 50 mg treatment showed significantly improved survival rate at 82.50+2.89% and 92.50+2.89%, respectively. Streptococcal bacteria were not recovered from the challenged survivors treated with SDMX-OMP (n=140) while the non-treated survivors showed S. agalactiae isolation 8 out of 41 fish (19.51%). The substantial increase in the number of proper survivors following the medication suggests that SDMX-OMP given at 50 mg/kg BW for 7 days could effectively control streptococcal infection in tilapia fry. The application of this study is particularly important for fish hatchery to control streptococcal infections affecting fish fry when they are premature for vaccination."
"Long-term effects of repeated oral dose of ivabradine on heart rate variability in dogs with asymptomatic degenerative mitral valve disease  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) is the most common acquired cardiac disease in geriatric dogs leading to impaired cardiac autonomic activity and functions. This study aimed to evaluate the heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and heart rate variability (HRV) of dogs with DMVD stage B2 in response to long-term treatment with ivabradine, orally. Four beagles with naturally occurring DMVD stage B2 were instrumented with a 24-h Holter recorder to obtain electrocardiography and HRV, an oscillometric device to acquire blood pressure (BP), HR and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) as assessed by rate-pressure product (RPP = HR x Systolic BP). Dogs were given ivabradine (1.0 mg/kg, twice daily, orally) for 3 months. Data were obtained at baseline and every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (M1 = 4 weeks, M2 = 8 weeks, and M3 = 12 weeks) after oral administration of ivabradine. The results revealed that chronic administration of ivabradine significantly decreased HR, BP, and RPP without adverse effects (P < 0.05). All indices of time- A nd frequency-domain of HRV at M3 were significantly increased when compared with baseline values (P < 0.05). The findings of this study imply that long-term treatment with ivabradine at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg twice daily in dogs with asymptomatic DMVD stage B2 decreased the HR, BP, MVO2 and improves HRV. This makes ivabradine potentially promising for management of elevated HR and impaired HRV in asymptomatic dogs with DMVD stage B2."
"Comparison of dried blood spot, buccal swab, cloacal swab and feces as DNA sources to identify avian sexes by PCR  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Absence of sexual dimorphism makes it difficult to determine bird's sex. A number of both invasive and non-invasive methods as a DNA template of sampling for avian sexing can be used. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of different sources of DNA for avian sexing by PCR. Samples were collected from dried blood spots, buccal swabs, cloacal swabs and feces. The highest success rate for sexing determination was from the dried blood spots, accounting for 100%, while those from the buccal swabs, cloacal swabs and feces were 74%, 75.47% and 29.17%, respectively. The non-urate fecal samples gave better results than the urate fecal samples, accounting for 50% and 18.75% success rates, respectively. The difference in the success rates of the method using buccal swabs and that using cloacal swabs was not statistically significant; moreover, both methods are non-invasive. In conclusion, the non-invasive method using buccal or cloacal swabs might be the choice of sources of DNA template for avian sexing by PCR."
"Effectiveness of Tuberculosis Screening Technology in the Initiation of Correct Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Thailand: Comparative Analysis of Xpert MTB/RIF Versus Sputum AFB Smear  2018 APJPH.Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is one of the top 10 causes of mortality worldwide in 2016. Early detection is very important, as it can help early treatment. This study compared 2 separate methods of diagnosing PTB among suspected patients, specifically examining correct diagnosis and the duration of receiving a correct diagnosis. It was carried out in a tertiary care public hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Ninety patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, one with the Xpert MTB/RIF (Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampicin) and the other with sputum AFB (acid-fast bacilli) smear. The proportion of correct diagnosis was 90.9% and 83.7% for the Xpert MTB/RIF and the comparison group, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (P >.05). However, the time to correct diagnosis in the Xpert MTB/RIF group was significantly shorter than the comparison group (2.23 days). This could lead to early diagnosis and lower transmission rate of PTB cases. Results support the provision of Xpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test for PTB in Thailand."
"A novel classification of anterior alveolar arch forms and alveolar bone thickness: A conebeam computed tomography study  2018 by Korean Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology.Purpose: This study classified alveolar arch forms and evaluated differences in alveolar bone thickness among arch forms in the anterior esthetic region using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Materials and Methods: Axial views of 113 CBCT images were assessed at the level of 3 mm below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the right and left canines. The root center points of teeth in the anterior esthetic region were used as reference points. Arch forms were classified according to their transverse dimensions and the intercanine width-to-depth ratio. The buccolingual alveolar bone thickness of each tooth was measured at 3 mm below the CEJ and at the mid-root level. Differences in the mean thicknesses among arch forms were analyzed. Results: Anterior maxillary arches could be classified as long narrow, short medium, long medium, and long wide arches. Significant differences in buccolingual alveolar bone thickness among the arch groups were found at both levels. The long wide arches presented the greatest bone thickness, followed by the long medium arches, while the long narrow and short medium arches were the thinnest. Conclusion: Arch forms were classified as long narrow, short medium, long medium, and long wide. The buccolingual alveolar bone thickness exhibited significant differences among the arch forms."
"A novel white spot syndrome virus protein WSSV164 controls prophenoloxidases, PmproPOs in shrimp melanization cascade  2018 Elsevier LtdMelanization, mediated by the prophenoloxidase (proPO)-activating system, is an important innate immune response in invertebrates. The implication of the proPO system in antiviral response and the suppression of host proPO activation by the viral protein have previously been demonstrated in shrimp. However, the molecular mechanism of viral-host interactions in the proPO cascade remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the viral protein, namely, WSSV164, which was initially identified from the forward suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library of the PmproPO1/2 co-silenced black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon that was challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, WSSV164 was found to interact with the PmproPO2 protein. The subsequent validation assay by co-immunoprecipitation revealed that WSSV164 directly bound to both PmproPO1 and PmproPO2. The gene silencing experiment was carried out to explore the role of WSSV164 in the control of the proPO pathway in shrimp, and the results showed that suppression of WSSV164 can restore PO activity in WSSV-infected shrimp hemolymph. The recombinant proteins of PmproPO1 and PmproPO2 were produced in Sf-9 cells and were shown to be successfully activated by exogenous trypsin and endogenous serine proteinases from shrimp hemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS), yielding PO activity in vitro. Moreover, the activated PO activity in shrimp HLS was dose-dependently reduced by the recombinant WSSV164 protein, suggesting that WSSV164 may interfere with the activation of the proPO system in shrimp. Taken together, these results suggest an alternative infection route of WSSV through the encoded viral protein WSSV164 that binds to the PmproPO1 and PmproPO2 proteins, interfering with the activation of the melanization cascade in shrimp."
"Exhaust emissions of a diesel engine using ethanol-in-palm oil/diesel microemulsion-based biofuels  2018 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.The use of palm oil and diesel blended with ethanol, known as a microemulsion biofuel, is gaining attention as an attractive renewable fuel for engines that may serve as a replacement for fossil-based fuels. The microemulsion biofuels can be formulated from the mixture of palm oil and diesel as the oil phase; ethanol as the polar phase; methyl oleate as the surfactant; alkanols as the cosurfactants. This study investigates the influence of the three cosurfactants on fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions in a direct-injection (DI) diesel engine. The microemulsion biofuels along with neat diesel fuel, palm oil-diesel blends, and biodiesel-diesel blends were tested in a DI diesel engine at two engine loads without engine modification. The formulated microemulsion biofuels increased fuel consumption and gradually reduced the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and exhaust gas temperature; however, there was no significant difference in their carbon monoxide (CO) emissions when compared to those of diesel. Varying the carbon chain length of the cosurfactant demonstrated that the octanol-microemulsion fuel emitted lower CO and NOx emissions than the butanol-and decanol-microemulsion fuels. Thus, the microemulsion biofuels demonstrated competitive advantages as potential fuels for diesel engines because they reduced exhaust emissions."
"Search for Zγ resonances using leptonic and hadronic final states in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search is presented for resonances decaying to a Z boson and a photon. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1, and collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. Two decay modes of the Z boson are investigated. In the leptonic channels, the Z boson candidates are reconstructed using electron or muon pairs. In the hadronic channels, they are identified using a large-radius jet, containing either light-quark or b quark decay products of the Z boson, via jet substructure and advanced b quark tagging techniques. The results from these channels are combined and interpreted in terms of upper limits on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction to Zγ for narrow and broad spin-0 resonances with masses between 0.35 and 4.0 TeV, providing thereby the most stringent limits on such resonances.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Search for new physics in dijet angular distributions using proton–proton collisions at √s=13TeV and constraints on dark matter and other models  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.A search is presented for physics beyond the standard model, based on measurements of dijet angular distributions in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV. The data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1. The observed distributions, corrected to particle level, are found to be in agreement with predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics that include electroweak corrections. Constraints are placed on models containing quark contact interactions, extra spatial dimensions, quantum black holes, or dark matter, using the detector-level distributions. In a benchmark model where only left-handed quarks participate, contact interactions are excluded at the 95% confidence level up to a scale of 12.8 or 17.5TeV, for destructive or constructive interference, respectively. The most stringent lower limits to date are set on the ultraviolet cutoff in the Arkani–Hamed–Dimopoulos–Dvali model of extra dimensions. In the Giudice–Rattazzi–Wells convention, the cutoff scale is excluded up to 10.1TeV. The production of quantum black holes is excluded for masses below 5.9 and 8.2TeV, depending on the model. For the first time, lower limits between 2.0 and 4.6TeVare set on the mass of a dark matter mediator for (axial-)vector mediators, for the universal quark coupling gq= 1.0."
"Sequence-based searching of custom proteome and transcriptome databases Published 2018. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.A long-term goal in renal physiology is to understand the mechanisms involved in collecting duct function and regulation at a cellular and molecular level. The first step in modeling of these mechanisms, which can provide a guide to experimentation, is the generation of a list of model components. We have curated a list of proteins expressed in the rat renal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) from proteomic data from 18 different publications. The database has been posted as a public resource at https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/IMCD_Proteome_Database/. It includes 8956 different proteins. To search the IMCD Proteomic Database efficiently, we have created a Java-based program called curated database Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (cdbBLAST), which uses the NCBI BLAST kernel to search for specific amino acid sequences corresponding to proteins in the database. cdbBLAST reports information on the matched protein and identifies proteins in the database that have similar sequences. We have also adapted cdbBLAST to interrogate our previously published IMCD Transcriptome Database. We have made the cdbBLAST program available for use either as a web application or a downloadable.jar file at https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/cdbBLAST/. Database searching based on protein sequence removes ambiguities arising from the standard search method based on official gene symbols and allows the user efficient identification of related proteins that may fulfill the same functional roles."
"Pseudonocardia mangrovi sp. Nov., isolated from soil  2018 IUMS.A novel Gram-stain-positive, aerobic actinomycete, designated strain SMC 195T, was isolated from soil collected from a mangrove forest in Thailand. The strain produced extensively branched substrate and aerial mycelia. The substrate mycelium was fragmented into rod-shaped elements, and spore chains consisting of smooth and rod-shaped spores were formed on the aerial mycelium. The results of phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that SMC 195Trepresented a member of the genus Pseudonocardia, and the most closely phylogenetically related species were Pseudonocardia yuanmonensisJCM 18055T(99.2 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Pseudonocardia halophobicaNRRL B-16514T(98.9 %) and Pseudonocardia kujensisNRRL B-24890T(98.7 %). However, the DNA-DNA relatedness values between SMC 195Tand the closest phylogenetically related species were significantly below 70 %. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 74±0.8 mol%. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The whole-cell sugars consisted of arabinose, galactose, glucose, rhamnose and ribose. The menaquinone was MK-8(H4) only. The major cellular fatty acid was the branched fatty acid iso-C16 : 0 (33.6 %). The polar lipids detected were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, hydroxyphosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and unidentified glycolipids. On the basis of the results from phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic studies, it is concluded that SMC 195Trepresents a novel species of the genus Pseudonocardia, for which the name Pseudonocardia mangrovi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SMC 195T(=TBRC 7778T=NBRC 113150T)."
"Actinomadura rhizosphaerae sp. Nov., isolated from rhizosphere soil of the plant Azadirachta Indica  2018 IUMS.A novel actinomycete, strain SDA37T, belonging to the genus Actinomadura, was isolated from rhizosphere soil collected from Udon Thani Province, Thailand. The taxonomic position of the strain was characterized using a polyphasic approach. Meso-diaminopimelic acid, glucose, ribose, galactose and madurose were detected in cell-wall and whole-cell hydrolysates. The N-acyl type of muramic acid was acetyl. Menaquinones were MK-9(H6), MK-9(H8) and MK-9(H4). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C16: 0, C16: 0, 10-methyl C18: 0 and iso-C14: 0. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol. BLAST analysis of the almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence showed 98.8% similarity to Actinomadura oligospora NBRC 104149T, 98.7% similarity to Actinomadura gamaensis DSM 100815T and 97.2% similarity to Actinomadura rupiterrae KCTC 19559T.

Strain SDA37T showed low DNA–DNA relatedness (44.3±7.3 to 58.5±8.7 %) to A. oligospora NBRC 104149T, Actinomadura gamaensis DSM 100815T and Actinomadura rupiterrae KCTC 19559T. The new strain could also be distinguished from its closely related strains by the differences in the phenotypic characteristics. The results of taxonomic analysis suggested that strain SDA37T represented a novel species of the genus Actinomadura for which the name Actinomadura rhizosphaerae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SDA37T (=KCTC 39965T=NBRC 112909T=TISTR 2523T)."
"Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Promotes Corneal Allograft Survival  2018 American Society for Investigative PathologyCorneal transplantation is the most prevalent form of tissue transplantation. The success of corneal transplantation mainly relies on the integrity of corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs), which maintain graft transparency. CEnC density decreases significantly after corneal transplantation even in the absence of graft rejection. To date, different strategies have been used to enhance CEnC survival. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) improves CEnC integrity during donor cornea tissue storage and protects CEnCs against oxidative stress–induced apoptosis. However, little is known about the effect of exogenous administration of VIP on corneal transplant outcomes. We found that VIP significantly accelerates endothelial wound closure and suppresses interferon-γ– and tumor necrosis factor-α–induced CEnC apoptosis in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we found that intracameral administration of VIP to mice undergoing syngeneic corneal transplantation with endothelial injury increases CEnC density and decreases graft opacity scores. Finally, using a mouse model of allogeneic corneal transplantation, we found for the first time that treatment with VIP significantly suppresses posttransplantation CEnC loss and improves corneal allograft survival."
"Targeted-volume noninvasive ventilation reduces extubation failure in postextubated medical Intensive Care Unit patients: A randomized controlled trial  2018 Medknow. All rights reserved.Purpose: Till date, the benefit of using noninvasive ventilation (NIV) routinely after extubation to prevent reintubation has been conflicting. We aim to demonstrate the effect of targeted-volume NIV for the prevention of reintubation and extubation failure after planned extubation in medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Study Design: This was a prospective, randomized controlled study. Materials and Methods: Patients on invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hrs for acute respiratory failure, who were ready for extubation, were randomized into targeted-volume NIV (intervention group) or oxygen mask (controlled group) immediately after extubation and continuously for 24 hrs. Results: A total of 58 patients were enrolled in this study. The targeted-volume NIV group was observed to have a trend toward lower reintubation rate within 48 hrs compared to oxygen mask group (0% vs. 17.2%; P = 0.052). Extubation failure rate within 48 hrs was significantly lower in targeted-volume NIV group compared to oxygen mask group (0% vs. 41.38%; P < 0.001). There was a trend toward lower ICU length of stay (6[5] days vs. 10[8] days (median interquartile range [IQR]); P = 0.053) as well as shorter hospital length of stay after extubation (10[19] days vs. 18[15] days (median [IQR]); P = 0.059). There were no differences in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (6.90% vs. 20.69%;P = 0.253) and 28 day-mortality (13.79% vs. 20.69%; P = 0.487). Conclusions: Our study is the first study to demonstrate the benefit of application of targeted-volume NIV immediately after extubation in reducing extubation failure rate. There was a trend toward lowering reintubation rate and shorter ICU length of stay and hospital length of stay after extubation in mixed medical ICU patients."
"Search for a heavy resonance decaying into a Z boson and a Z or W boson in 2ℓ2q final states at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search has been performed for heavy resonances decaying to ZZ or ZW in 2ℓ2q final states, with two charged leptons (ℓ = e, μ) produced by the decay of a Z boson, and two quarks produced by the decay of a W or Z boson. The analysis is sensitive to resonances with masses in the range from 400 to 4500 GeV. Two categories are defined based on the merged or resolved reconstruction of the hadronically decaying vector boson, optimized for high- and low-mass resonances, respectively. The search is based on data collected during 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. No excess is observed in the data above the standard model background expectation. Upper limits on the production cross section of heavy, narrow spin-1 and spin-2 resonances are derived as a function of the resonance mass, and exclusion limits on the production of W′ bosons and bulk graviton particles are calculated in the framework of the heavy vector triplet model and warped extra dimensions, respectively.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Search for top squarks decaying via four-body or chargino-mediated modes in single-lepton final states in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for the pair production of the lightest supersymmetric partner of the top quark (t ˜ 1) is presented. The search focuses on a compressed scenario where the mass difference between the top squark and the lightest supersymmetric particle, often considered to be the lightest neutralino (χ˜10), is smaller than the mass of the W boson. The proton-proton collision data were recorded by the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. In this search, two decay modes of the top squark are considered: a four-body decay into a bottom quark, two additional fermions, and a χ˜10; and a decay via an intermediate chargino. Events are selected using the presence of a high-momentum jet, significant missing transverse momentum, and a low transverse momentum electron or muon. Two analysis techniques are used, targeting different decay modes of the t ˜ 1: a sequential selection and a multivariate technique. No evidence for the production of top squarks is found, and mass limits at 95% confidence level are set that reach up to 560 GeV, depending on the m(t˜1)−m(χ˜10) mass difference and the decay mode.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to γγ or τ + τ − at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for dark matter particles is performed by looking for events with large transverse momentum imbalance and a recoiling Higgs boson decaying to either a pair of photons or a pair of τ leptons. The search is based on proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected at the CERN LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. No significant excess over the expected standard model background is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are presented for the product of the production cross section and branching fraction in the context of two benchmark simplified models. For the Z′-two-Higgs-doublet model (where Z′ is a new massive boson mediator) with an intermediate heavy pseudoscalar particle of mass mA = 300 GeV and mDM = 100 GeV, the Z′ masses from 550 GeV to 1265 GeV are excluded. For a baryonic Z′ model, with mDM = 1 GeV, Z′ masses up to 615 GeV are excluded. Results are also presented for the spin-independent cross section for the dark matter-nucleon interaction as a function of the mass of the dark matter particle. This is the first search for dark matter particles produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to two τ leptons.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Antimicrobial resistance in commensal Escherichia coli isolated from pigs and pork derived from farms either routinely using or not using in-feed antimicrobials  2018 Kittitat Lugsomya et al.The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate whether routine in-feed antimicrobial use in pigs or not resulted in differences in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) E. coli at different pig producing stages, and (ii) to determine whether resistant strains were presented in pig meat postslaughter. A total of 300 commensal E. coli isolates were obtained and examined for antibiograms, AMR genes, plasmid replicons, and molecular types. The isolates were from two farms either using (A) or not using in-feed antimicrobials (NA), sampled four times during the production cycle and once postslaughter. E. coli resistant to aminoglycosides containing aadA1, aadA2, and aadB and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBLP) E. coli containing blaCTX-M-1 were significantly increased in the nursery and growing periods in farm A compared to farm NA. IncI1-Iγ and IncHI2 were common in the nursery period and were shown to transfer blaCTX-M genes by conjugation. ST10 was the most common type only found in live pigs. ST604, ST877, ST1209, and ST2798 ESBLP were found only in live pigs, whereas ST72, ST302, and ST402 ESBLP were found in pig meat."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Throughout recent times, cybersecurity problems have occurred in various business applications. Although previous researchers proposed to cope with the occurrence of cybersecurity issues, their methods repeatedly replicated the training processes for several times to classify datasets of these problems in streaming non-stationary environments. In dynamic environments, the conventional methods possibly deteriorate the adaptive solution to prevent these issues. This research proposes a one-pass-throw-away learning using the dynamical structure of the network to solve these problems in dynamic environments. Furthermore, to speed up the computational time and to maintain a minimum space complexity for streaming data, the new concepts of learning in forms of recursive functions were introduced. The information gain-based feature selection was also applied to reduce the learning time during the training process. The experimental results signified that the proposed algorithm outperformed the others in incremental-like and online ensemble learning algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, space complexity, and computational time."
"Effect of Combined Treatment with MLC601 (NeuroAiDTM) and Rehabilitation on Post-Stroke Recovery: The CHIMES and CHIMES-E Studies  2018 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.Background and Purpose: MLC601 has been shown in preclinical studies to enhance neurorestorative mechanisms after stroke. The aim of this post hoc analysis was to assess whether combining MLC601 and rehabilitation has an effect on improving functional outcomes after stroke. Methods: Data from the CHInese Medicine NeuroAiD Efficacy on Stroke (CHIMES) and CHIMES-Extension (CHIMES-E) studies were analyzed. CHIMES-E was a 24-month follow-up study of subjects included in CHIMES, a multi-centre, double-blind placebo-controlled trial which randomized subjects with acute ischemic stroke, to either MLC601 or placebo for 3 months in addition to standard stroke treatment and rehabilitation. Subjects were stratified according to whether they received or did not receive persistent rehabilitation up to month (M)3 (non- randomized allocation) and by treatment group. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index were assessed at month (M) 3, M6, M12, M18, and M24. Results: Of 880 subjects in CHIMES-E, data on rehabilitation at M3 were available in 807 (91.7%, mean age 61.8 ± 11.3 years, 36% female). After adjusting for prognostic factors of poor outcome (age, sex, pre-stroke mRS, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and stroke onset-to-study-treatment time), subjects who received persistent rehabilitation showed consistently higher treatment effect in favor of MLC601 for all time points on mRS 0-1 dichotomy analysis (ORs 1.85 at M3, 2.18 at M6, 2.42 at M12, 1.94 at M18, 1.87 at M24), mRS ordinal analysis (ORs 1.37 at M3, 1.40 at M6, 1.53 at M12, 1.50 at M18, 1.38 at M24), and BI ≥95 dichotomy analysis (ORs 1.39 at M3, 1.95 at M6, 1.56 at M12, 1.56 at M18, 1.46 at M24) compared to those who did not receive persistent rehabilitation. Conclusions: More subjects on MLC601 improved to functional independence compared to placebo among subjects receiving persistent rehabilitation up to M3. The larger treatment effect of MLC601 was sustained over 2 years which supports the hypothesis that MLC601 combined with rehabilitation might have beneficial and sustained effects on neuro-repair processes after stroke. There is a need for more data on the effect of combining rehabilitation programs with stroke recovery treatments."
"Carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae from Bangkok, Thailand, and their detection by the Carba NP and modified carbapenem inactivation method tests  2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Aim: The purpose of the study was to determine the epidemiology of carbapenemase genes among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and evaluate the Carba NP and modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) tests in their detection. Materials and Methods: A total of 287 nonduplicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates, which were at least resistant to one of the carbapenems, were identified and detected for carbapenemase genes by multiplex PCR covering blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaOXA-48-like. All positive genes were then sequenced. These isolates were phenotypically tested for the production of carbapenemases by mCIM and Carba NP tests to evaluate the efficacy of these methods. Results: Seven species of carbapenem-resistant isolates mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae were detected. Of these isolates, three families of carbapenemase genes, including blaNDM (blaNDM-1, -4, -5, -9), blaOXA (blaOXA-48, -181, -232), and blaIMP-14, were found. Of these, 223 (77.70%) carried at least one of the carbapenemase genes. The blaNDM was detected in 160/223 (71.75%) isolates, of which 153/160 (95.63%) were the blaNDM-1. Three types of the blaOXA-48-like group, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-181, and blaOXA-232, were found, 91/104 (87.5%) harbored the blaOXA-232. In addition, 25.11% (56/223) of the carbapenemase-producing isolates harbored a combination of blaNDM and blaOXA-48-like. Phenotypic detection methods, mCIM and Carba NP, showed 100% sensitivity and specificity to blaNDM, blaIMP-14, and blaOXA-48, while the mCIM was positive in all blaOXA-181 and blaOXA-232 isolates, only 12.5% (1/8) and 28.95% (11/38), respectively, were detected by the Carba NP test. Conclusions: This study revealed a unique prevalence of carbapenemase genes in Bangkok, Thailand, as well as demonstrated the efficacy and limitation of phenotypic detection methods of carbapenemase in the area where blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-232 were predominant."
"Search for additional neutral MSSM Higgs bosons in the τ τ final state in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search is presented for additional neutral Higgs bosons in the τ τ final state in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM), using the data collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search includes production of the Higgs boson in association with b quarks. No significant deviation above the expected background is observed. Model-independent limits at 95% confidence level (CL) are set on the product of the branching fraction for the decay into τ leptons and the cross section for the production via gluon fusion or in association with b quarks. These limits range from 18 pb at 90 GeV to 3.5 fb at 3.2 TeV for gluon fusion and from 15 pb (at 90 GeV) to 2.5 fb (at 3.2 TeV) for production in association with b quarks, assuming a narrow width resonance. In the mh hod + scenario these limits translate into a 95% CL exclusion of tan β > 6 for neutral Higgs boson masses below 250 GeV, where tan β is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two Higgs doublets. The 95% CL exclusion contour reaches 1.6 TeV for tan β = 60.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"The Development of Late-Stage Continental Breakup: Seismic Reflection and Borehole Evidence from the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia 2018. The Authors.During continental breakup, the locus of strain shifts from a broad region of border faulting and ductile plate stretching to a narrow zone of magma intrusion in a young ocean basin. Recent studies of volcanic rifts and margins worldwide suggest this shift occurs subaerially, before the onset of seafloor spreading. We test this hypothesis using recently acquired seismic reflection and borehole data from the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, a unique region of transition between continental rifting and seafloor spreading. Our data, located near Dallol, ~30 km northwest of the Erta'Ale Volcanic Segment, reveal a remarkably thick (>1-km) sequence of young (~100-ka) evaporites in a basin bound by a major (≤400-m-throw), east-dipping normal fault. To generate such a large amount of subsidence in such a relatively short time, we propose that upper-crustal extension in Danakil is currently dominated by faulting, not magmatic intrusion. Given the region's markedly thinned crust (~15-km-thick), relative to elsewhere in Afar where magma-assisted rifting dominates and maintains crustal thickness at ~25 km, mechanical extension in Danakil is likely coupled with ductile extension of the lower-crust and mantle lithosphere. Despite proximity to the voluminous lavas of the active Erta'Ale Volcanic Segment, evidence for igneous material in the upper ~2 km of the 6- to 10-km-wide basin is limited. Late-stage stretching was likely aided by thermal/strain-induced lithospheric weakening following protracted magma-assisted rifting. Basin formation immediately prior to the onset of seafloor spreading may also explain the accumulation of thick marine-seepage-fed evaporite sequences akin to those observed, for example, along the South Atlantic rifted margins."
"The cosmological constant in supergravity  2018, The Author(s).We propose a supersymmetrisation of the cosmological constant in ordinary N= 1 supergravity that breaks supersymmetry spontaneously by a constant Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term associated to a U(1) symmetry. This term is a variation of a new gauge invariant FI term proposed recently, which is invariant under Kähler transformations and can be written even for a gauged R-symmetry on top of the standard FI contribution. The two terms are the same in the absence of matter but differ in its presence. The proposed term is reduced to a constant FI-term up to fermion interactions that disappear in the unitary gauge in the absence of any F-term supersymmetry breaking. The constant FI term leads to a positive cosmological constant, uplifting the vacuum energy from the usual anti-de Sitter supergravity to any higher value."
"A genome scan of diversifying selection in Ophiocordyceps zombie-ant fungi suggests a role for enterotoxins in co-evolution and host specificity  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdIdentification of the genes underlying adaptation sheds light on the biological functions targeted by natural selection. Searches for footprints of positive selection, in the form of rapid amino acid substitutions, and the identification of species-specific genes have proved to be powerful approaches to identifying the genes involved in host specialization in plant-pathogenic fungi. We used an evolutionary comparative genomic approach to identify genes underlying host adaptation in the ant-infecting genus Ophiocordyceps, which manipulates ant behaviour. A comparison of the predicted genes in the genomes of species from three species complexes—O. unilateralis, O. australis and O. subramanianii—revealed an enrichment in pathogenesis-associated functions, including heat-labile enterotoxins, among species-specific genes. Furthermore, these genes were overrepresented among those displaying significant footprints of positive selection. Other categories of genes suspected to be important for virulence and pathogenicity in entomopathogenic fungi (e.g., chitinases, lipases, proteases, core secondary metabolism genes) were much less represented, although a few candidate genes were found to evolve under positive selection. An analysis including orthologs from other entomopathogenic fungi in a broader context showed that positive selection on enterotoxins was specific to the ant-infecting genus Ophiocordyceps. Together with previous studies reporting the overexpression of an enterotoxin during behavioural manipulation in diseased ants, our findings suggest that heat-labile enterotoxins are important effectors in host adaptation and co-evolution in the Ophiocordyceps entomopathogenic fungi."
"Search for third-generation scalar leptoquarks decaying to a top quark and a τ lepton at √s=13Te  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.A search for pair production of heavy scalar leptoquarks (LQs), each decaying into a top quark and a τ lepton, is presented. The search considers final states with an electron or a muon, one or two τ leptons that decayed to hadrons, and additional jets. The data were collected in 2016 in proton–proton collisions at s=13Te with the CMS detector at the LHC, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1. No evidence for pair production of LQs is found. Assuming a branching fraction of unity for the decay LQ → t τ, upper limits on the production cross section are set as a function of LQ mass, excluding masses below 900Ge at 95% confidence level. These results provide the most stringent limits to date on the production of scalar LQs that decay to a top quark and a τ lepton."
"Measurement of the Z / γ∗→ ττ cross section in pp collisions at √s=13TeV and validation of τ lepton analysis techniques  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.A measurement is presented of the Z / γ∗→ ττ cross section in pp collisions at s=13TeV, using data recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3fb-1. The product of the inclusive cross section and branching fraction is measured to be σ(pp→Z/γ∗+X)B(Z/γ∗→ττ)=1848±12(stat)±67(syst \,+\,lumi) pb, in agreement with the standard model expectation, computed at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. The measurement is used to validate new analysis techniques relevant for future measurements of τ lepton production. The measurement also provides the reconstruction efficiency and energy scale for τ decays to hadrons+ντ final states, determined with respective relative uncertainties of 2.2 and 0.9%."
"Screening and application of microsatellite markers for genetic diversity analysis of captive eastern sarus crane Grus antigone sharpii Blanford, 1895 in Thailand  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The eastern sarus crane, Grus antigone sharpii, is distributed in the Indochina area, though it has become extinct in Thailand. The Thai government has tried to repopulate the cranes using wild individuals from Cambodia as initial breeding stock. Although captive breeding can reintroduce species back into the wild, the genetic diversity of the population is also important. This study aimed to screen microsatellite markers to investigate the genetic diversity of G. a. sharpii from two breeding facilities in Thailand and to assess its potential for future conservation programs. Eighteen microsatellite loci isolated from whooping crane (G. americana) and blue crane (Anthropoides paradisea) were screened in all captive reared cranes from Khao Kheow Open Zoo (n = 11) and Bangpra Water Bird Breeding Station (n = 17), Chonburi Province. Of 18 loci analyzed, 14 were found to be polymorphic, and 3 loci were in linkage disequilibrium. Apparent deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was observed only at locus Gram8, resulting from the presence of a null allele. The average expected and observed heterozygosities from 10 loci analyzed are 0.61 and 0.64, respectively. The overall fixation index suggested that cranes from both facilities shared many common alleles (FST= 0.023, p < 0.05); in addition, Bayesian clustering analysis implied that cranes from two breeding facilities are homogeneous (K = 1). Our findings reveal high level of genetic diversity of the captive crane population in Thailand and suggest that the breeding stocks may be suitable for ensuring a sustainable breeding program in the future."
"Measurement of charged particle spectra in minimum-bias events from proton–proton collisions at √s=13TeV  2018, The Author(s).Pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and multiplicity distributions are measured in the pseudorapidity range | η| < 2.4 for charged particles with transverse momenta satisfying pT>0.5GeV in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s=13TeV. Measurements are presented in three different event categories. The most inclusive of the categories corresponds to an inelastic p p data set, while the other two categories are exclusive subsets of the inelastic sample that are either enhanced or depleted in single diffractive dissociation events. The measurements are compared to predictions from Monte Carlo event generators used to describe high-energy hadronic interactions in collider and cosmic-ray physics."
"Measurement of the weak mixing angle using the forward–backward asymmetry of Drell–Yan events in p p collisions at 8 TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.A measurement is presented of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle (sin2θeffℓ) using the forward–backward asymmetry of Drell–Yan lepton pairs (μμ and e e) produced in proton–proton collisions at s=8TeV at the CMS experiment of the LHC. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 18.8 and 19.6fb-1 in the dimuon and dielectron channels, respectively, containing 8.2 million dimuon and 4.9 million dielectron events. With more events and new analysis techniques, including constraints obtained on the parton distribution functions from the measured forward–backward asymmetry, the statistical and systematic uncertainties are significantly reduced relative to previous CMS measurements. The extracted value of sin2θeffℓ from the combined dilepton data is sin2θeffℓ=0.23101±0.00036(stat)±0.00018(syst)±0.00016(theo)±0.00031(parton distributions in proton)=0.23101±0.00053."
"The first record of dizygotic twins in semi-wild stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides) tested using microsatellite markers and the occurrence of supernumerary nipples  2018 The Mammal Society of Japan.The birth of twins, and especially multiple sirehood dizygotic twins, is very rare in Old World monkeys, the only previous record is of a captive rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Here, we report a case of multiple sirehood dizygotic twins among the 114 newborns (0.88%) recorded in a population of semi-wild stump-tailed macaques (M. arctoides) in the Khao Krapuk Khao Taomor (KKP) Non-hunting Area, Thailand. Using ten microsatellite markers, we determined that the infants were sired by different adult males, thus suggesting the multiple sirehood. Since the association between twin birth and high frequencies of supernumerary (> 2) nipples was reported in Formosan macaques (M. cyclopis) in Taiwan, the supernumerary nipples were observed in KKP macaques. Of the 332 monkeys counted, 22% of the adults and subadults in the KKP population, and 33.3% of females in the focus (Ting) group, had supernumerary nipples. However, both twins and their mother had two ordinary nipples. Thus, we conclude that it has no association between the occurrence of supernumerary nipples and twin births in stump-tailed macaques."
"Effect of Endoscopic Sinus Surgery on Bronchiectasis Patients With Chronic Rhinosinusitis  The Author(s) 2018.Background: The concept of unified airway disease has linked bronchiectasis with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), much in the same way as in asthma and CRS. Although the outcomes of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on comorbid asthma have been relatively well studied, the outcomes of ESS on comorbid bronchiectasis have rarely been examined. Objective: We sought to determine sinonasal and pulmonary clinical outcomes of ESS in bronchiectasis patients with CRS. Method: We reviewed all bronchiectasis patients who had ESS for CRS at our institution from 2006 to present. The sinonasal outcome test 22 (SNOT-22) was administered preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years postoperatively. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were measured preoperatively and at 6 months and 1 year post operation to assess the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced viral capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC values. Paired t test and Pearson correlation were used to compare pre- and postsurgical results. Results: A total of 141 bronchiectasis patients who had ESS for CRS were studied. The most common cause of bronchiectasis was cystic fibrosis (CF) (42.55%). SNOT-22 scores improved at 3 months post operation and were maintained at 1 year and 3 years post operation (P <.001). All SNOT sub-domains showed a significant improvement after surgery (P <.01). However, PFTs did not change at 6 months post operation and 1 year post operation (P >.05). There were significant differences in the outcomes in CF versus non-CF patients (P <.05) but not by sex or age. Conclusion: ESS is effective in improving long-term sinonasal outcomes in bronchiectasis patients with CRS. However, ESS does not appear to improve the pulmonary function."
"Achieving higher full-diversity gain of downlink STBC-MIMO SCMA system  2018 Journal of Communications.Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are two important techniques that can solve high spectral efficiency problem and the massive connectivity requires of fifth generation wireless communication industry in the future. In this paper, the combination of space-time block code multiple input multiple output (STBC-MIMO) and SCMA system are suggested. However, STBC-MIMO system has diversity gain from the number of transmission and receiving antennas for flat MIMO channels. In order to make STBC-MIMO SCMA system achieve higher diversity gain, I suggest a simple method, new SCMA codeword mapping with STBC, that has diversity from the number of resolvable paths for any pairs of transmit-receive antennas. The simulation result demonstrates that the presented SCMA codeword mapping can improve bit-error rate performance."
"Effect of surface modifications of SBA-15 with aminosilanes and 12-tungstophosphoric acid on catalytic properties in environmentally friendly esterification of glycerol with oleic acid to produce monoolein  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A series of protonated amino-functionalized SBA-15 materials was synthesized and tested as heterogeneous catalysts for the esterification of glycerolwith oleic acid to producemonoolein. Mesoporous SBA-15 (S) was functionalized with three different aminosilanes: 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (N1); [3-(2-amino-ethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane] (N2); and (3-trimethoxysilylpropyl) diethylenetriamine (N3), before being impregnated with 40 wt % 12-tungstophosphoric acid (HPW). The resulting nanocatalysts (S-Nx-HPW) were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), N2 adsorption-desorption, SEMequipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and elemental analysis techniques. The presence of components of the nanocatalysts and the preservation of the hexagonal structure of SBA-15 were confirmed. Using different functionalizing agents considerably affected the textural properties and acidity of the synthesized nanocatalysts, which helped to improve the catalytic performance. In particular, S-N2-HPW was more active and selective than other catalysts in this study, as well as than a number of other commercial acid catalysts, with 95.0% oleic acid conversion and 60.9% monoolein selectivity being obtained after five h of reaction at 160 °C using 2.5 wt % of catalyst loading and glycerol/oleic acid molar ratio of 4:1. Aminosilane functionalization also helped to increase the reusability of the catalysts to at least six cycles without considerable loss of activity through strong electrostatic interactions between HPW anions and the protonated amino-functionalized SBA-15 materials."
"Preparation and properties of gelatin nanofibers containing liopeptide biosurfactant by electrospinning technique as the prototype of wound covering and healing materials  2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.Gelatin nanofibers containing lipopeptide biosurfactant which had high surface activities and antimicrobial potential were fabricated by electrospinning technique to study their potentiality for biomedical applications. Operating voltage and concentration (w/w) of lipopeptide biosurfactant in 20% (w/v) gelatin solution were considered as the experimental variables at fixed flow rate, fabricating time, and distance between the needle tip and fiber collector. The diameter trend of the electrospun nanofibers increased with the increase of the operating voltage and the biosurfactant ratio. The contact angle between the nanofiber surface and water droplet was greater when compared with that of gelatin nanofiber without the biosurfactant. The percentage of the biosurfactant would affect the porosity of the obtained nanofiber mat. The most suitable gelatin nanofiber for wound healing and covering application under this study was obtained from 25% (w/w) lipopeptide biosurfactant in gelatin solution at 6 kV operating voltage. These nanofibers also showed reasonably antimicrobial property against E. coli and S. aureus. The novelty found in this study is that the percentage of water uptake which is one of the most important factors for wound healing and covering materials of the obtained electrospun nanofibers is much better than that of the commercially one used nowadays."
"Association between HLA-B ∗ 44:03-HLA-C ∗ 07:01 haplotype and cold medicine-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome with severe ocular complications in Thailand  Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018. All rights reserved. No commercial use is permitted unless otherwise expressly granted. Background Polymorphisms in human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes have been found to be associated with cold medicine (CM)-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) with severe ocular complications (SOC). Because ethnic differences in genetic predisposition to SJS/TEN among different populations have been proposed, we focused on Thai patients and investigated the association between HLA class I genotypes and CM-SJS/TEN with SOC. Methods This multicentre case-control study was conducted between September 2014 and August 2017. Seventy-one Thai patients with SJS/TEN with SOC and 159 healthy Thai controls were enrolled. HLA typing was performed. Genetic relationships were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Results Of 71 patients with SJS/TEN with SOC (28 male, 43 female), 49 (69%) had a history of taking cold medications prior to SJS/TEN onset. The mean age of onset was 26.7±17.1 years (range, 2-77 years). HLA-B ∗ 44:03 (OR, 7.2, p=5.5×10 -6, pc=1.1×10 -4) and HLA-C ∗ 07:01 (OR, 6.1, p=7.1×10 -6, pc=1.1×10 -4) showed significant positive associations with Thai patients with CM-SJS/TEN with SOC. Additionally, 17 of 49 patients with CM-SJS/TEN with SOC (34.7%) significantly harboured the HLA-B ∗ 44:03 and HLA-C ∗ 07:01 haplotype compared with only 11 of 159 healthy controls (6.9%) (OR=7.1, p=5.5×10 -6). Conclusions HLA-B ∗ 44:03-HLA-C ∗ 07:01 haplotype is a potential risk factor for CM-SJS/TEN with SOC in the Thai population. This study supports that HLA-B ∗ 44:03 might be a common marker for CM-SJS/TEN with SOC in Eurasia populations, including European, Indian, Japanese and Thai."
"Native Top-Down Mass Spectrometry and Ion Mobility MS for Characterizing the Cobalt and Manganese Metal Binding of α-Synuclein Protein  2018, American Society for Mass Spectrometry. Structural characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) has been a major challenge in the field of protein science due to limited capabilities to obtain full-length high-resolution structures. Native ESI-MS with top-down MS was utilized to obtain structural features of protein-ligand binding for the Parkinson’s disease-related protein, α-synuclein (αSyn), which is natively unstructured. Binding of heavy metals has been implicated in the accelerated formation of αSyn aggregation. Using high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, native top-down MS with various fragmentation methods, including electron capture dissociation (ECD), collisional activated dissociation (CAD), and multistage tandem MS (MS 3 ), deduced the binding sites of cobalt and manganese to the C-terminal region of the protein. Ion mobility MS (IM-MS) revealed a collapse toward compacted states of αSyn upon metal binding. The combination of native top-down MS and IM-MS provides structural information of protein-ligand interactions for intrinsically disordered proteins. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Real-World Safety of Intravitreal Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab Treatments for Retinal Diseases in Thailand: A Prospective Observational Study  2018, The Author(s).Background: There is very limited evidence examining serious systemic adverse events (SSAEs) and post-injection endophthalmitis of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) and intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) treatments in Thailand and low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, findings from the existing trials might have limited generalizability to certain populations and rare SSAEs. Objectives: This prospective observational study aimed to assess and compare the safety profiles of IVB and IVR in patients with retinal diseases in Thailand. Methods: Between 2013 and 2015, 6354 patients eligible for IVB or IVR were recruited from eight hospitals. Main outcomes measures were prevalence and risk of SSAEs, mortality, and endophthalmitis during the 6-month follow-up period. Results: In the IVB and IVR groups, 94 and 6% of patients participated, respectively. The rates of outcomes in the IVB group were slightly greater than in the IVR group. All-cause mortality rates in the IVB and IVR groups were 1.10 and 0.53%, respectively. Prevalence rates of endophthalmitis and non-fatal strokes in the IVB group were 0.04% of 16,421 injections and 0.27% of 5975 patients, respectively, whereas none of these events were identified in the IVR group. There were no differences between the two groups in the risks of mortality, arteriothrombotic events (ATE), and non-fatal heart failure (HF). Adjustment for potential confounding factors and selection bias using multivariable models for time-to-event outcomes and propensity scores did not alter the results. Conclusions: The rates of SAEs in both groups were low. The IVB and IVR treatments were not associated with significant risks of mortality, ATE, and non-fatal HF. Trial Registration: Thai Clinical Trial Registry identifier TCTR20141002001."
"Diversity and characterization of cultivable oleaginous yeasts isolated from mangrove forests  2018, Springer Nature B.V.A total of 198 yeasts were isolated from 140 samples collected from 7 mangrove forests in 4 provinces of Thailand, and were found to belong to 30 genera, 45 described species and at least 12 undescribed species based on their 26S rRNA (D1/D2 domain) gene sequence. The most prevalent species was Candida tropicalis, followed by Candida pseudolambica and Rhodosporidium paludigena. Lipid accumulation, as determined by Nile red staining, of the isolated yeasts revealed that 69 and 18 strains were positive and strongly positive, respectively, while quantitative analysis of the intracellular lipid accumulated in the latter indicated that 10 of these strains, Pseudozyma tsukubaensis (YWT7-2 and YWT7-3), Rhodotorula sphaerocarpa (YWW6-1 and SFL14-1SF), Saitozyma podzolica (YWT1-1, NS3-3 and NS10-2), Prototheca zopfii var. hydrocarbonea OMS6-1 and Prototheca sp. (YMTW3-1 and YMTS5-2), were oleaginous. In this study we found that under nitrogen depletion condition (155 C/N ratio) Pseudozyma tsukubaensis YWT7-2 accumulated the highest level of intracellular lipid at 32.4% (w/w, dry cell weight), with a broadly similar fatty acid composition to that in palm oil."
"Re-estimating software effort using prior phase efforts and data mining techniques  2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.Software effort estimation has played an important role in software project management. An accurate estimation helps reduce cost overrun and the eventual project failure. Unfortunately, many existing estimation techniques rely on the total project effort which is often determined from the project life cycle. As the project moves on, the course of action deviates from what originally has planned, despite close monitoring and control. This leads to re-estimating software effort so as to improve project operating costs and budgeting. Recent research endeavors attempt to explore phase level estimation that uses known information from prior development phases to predict effort of the next phase by using different learning techniques. This study aims to investigate the influence of preprocessing in prior phases on learning techniques to re-estimate the effort of next phase. The proposed re-estimation approach preprocesses prior phase effort by means of statistical techniques to select a set of input features for learning which in turn are exploited to generate the estimation models. These models are then used to re-estimate next phase effort by using four processing steps, namely data transformation, outlier detection, feature selection, and learning. An empirical study is conducted on 440 estimation models being generated from combinations of techniques on 5 data transformation, 5 outlier detection, 5 feature selection, and 5 learning techniques. The experimental results show that suitable preprocessing is significantly useful for building proper learning techniques to boosting re-estimation accuracy. However, there is no one learning technique that can outperform other techniques over all phases. The proposed re-estimation approach yields more accurate estimation than proportion-based estimation approach. It is envisioned that the proposed re-estimation approach can facilitate researchers and project managers on re-estimating software effort so as to finish the project on time and within the allotted budget."
"Inhibitory effects and killing kinetics of lactic acid rice gel against pathogenic bacteria causing bovine mastitis  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis are the major teat skin bacteria and lead to severe bovine mastitis. Teat antiseptic is an important tool for controlling intramammary infection. The antibacterial activity of lactic acid (LA) against one reference strain of S. aureus ATCC 25923 and two field strains including S. aureus and S. epidermidis was investigated using the broth microdilution method. Its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were 0.5% for strains belonging to both species. An antiseptic preparation containing 5% LA with modified rice gel (LA-RG) was successfully prepared. Rheological behavior of LA-RG was found to be a pseudoplastic flow with thixotropy with viscosity of approximately 0.007 Pas. LA-RG exhibited a sufficient adhesive property in the rolling ball test with a length of 9.67 ± 0.04 cm. Killing kinetic studies of LA-RG showed that the killing rate of LA-RG was significantly faster than that of LA. After 32 min of exposure to LA-RG, approximately 86% and 60% of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were reduced, respectively. Abnormal bacterial cell surface after exposure to LA-RG was observed by scanning electron microscopy. It is concluded that LA-RG is a promising preparation as an alternative product for preventing mastitis in dairy cattle."
"Synthesis of three-dimensional hierarchical CuO flower-like architecture and its photocatalytic activity for rhodamine b degradation  2018 The AuthorsThe flower-like CuO materials with a good uniformity were successfully synthesized by the self-assembly method. By using pH ranging from 7 to 9, CuO provided different morphologies. X-ray diffraction ̣(XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the purity and uniformity of the CuO particles, respectively. The particles show flower-like structures composed of CuO nano-sheets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the uniformity of nanosheet-like CuO particles with lattice dimensions of 0.2–0.4 nm. In a preliminary experiment, the rhodamine b degradation was observed by using CuO as a photocatalyst. These semiconducting particles were found to enhance the degradation of the azo dye within 240 min. It was remarkable to note that as-synthesized CuO particles from the self-assembly method provided a good uniformity in morphology. It also exhibited good and suitable properties to serve as a photocatalyst for rhodamine b degradation."
"Proteome-wide identification of epitope-based vaccine candidates against multi-drug resistant Proteus mirabilis  2018 International Alliance for Biological StandardizationProteus mirabilis is one of the important pathogens of urinary tract and exhibits resistance to multiple drugs. Development of vaccine tends to be the most promising and cost-effective remedy against the said pathogen. Herein, we implement a combinatorial approach for screening proteins harboring potential broad-spectrum antigenic epitopes in the proteome of P. mirabilis. The targets are host non-homologous, essential and virulent, and have localization in the extracellular and outer membrane. Immuno-informatics revealed antigenic, surface exposed and broad-spectrum B-cell derived T-cell epitopes for three membrane usher family candidates: AtfC, PMI2533 and PMI1466, which could evoke a substantial immune response. Protein-protein interactions of targeted three proteins have shown their involvement in biologically significant pathways indispensable for the growth and survival of the pathogen. The antigenic epitopes are conserved among all completely annotated strains and docked deeply in the binding cavity of the most prevalent allele-DRB1*0101 in human population. Future work is necessary to characterize the shortlisted proteins and epitopes for immune protection in animal models."
"Non-Abelian T-duality and modular invariance  2018 The Author(s)Two-dimensional σ-models corresponding to coset CFTs of the type (gˆk⊕hˆℓ)/hˆk+ℓ admit a zoom-in limit involving sending one of the levels, say ℓ to infinity. The result is the non-Abelian T-dual of the WZW model for the algebra gˆk with respect to the vector action of the subalgebra h of g. We examine modular invariant partition functions in this context. Focusing on the case with g=h=su(2) we apply the above limit to the branching functions and modular invariant partition function of the coset CFT, which as a whole is a delicate procedure. Our main concrete result is that such a limit is well defined and the resulting partition function is modular invariant."
"Comparison of specific IgE detection by immunoblotting anfluorescence enzyme assay with in vivo skin prick test  2018, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Diagnostic tools to identify allergens that cause allergic symptom is important part in the care of allergic patients. Detection of causative allergen can be performed by in vivo skin prick test (SPT) or in vitro tests for detection serum specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE). The common methods used are fluorescent enzyme assay and immunoblotting assay. Objective: We aim to evaluate performance of the two sIgE determination systems, immunoblotting assay (Euroline) and fluorescent enzyme assay (ImmunoCAP) in comparison with SPT. Methods: Two hundred and two participants with allergic diseases were enrolled. Sensitization to common allergens was identified using skin prick test and serum specific IgE assays with Euroline and ImmunoCAP. Both systems provide the result in the same unit and the same cut-off value (0.35 kUA/L). The specific IgE levels of 4 aeroallergens, 6 food allergens and 3 food allergen components were analyzed to evaluate the performance of both sIgE assays with SPT. Results: When compared with the result of SPT, ImmunoCAP has 63.9-93.2% agreement and Euroline has 68.4-86.2% agreement for allergen detection. Both sIgE assays have significant correlation in measuring sIgE of almost all allergens (r = 0.626-0.901, p < 0.001) except for dog. For food allergen components, both sIgE tests have outstanding correlation and agreement (r = 0.816-0.952, p < 0.001; agreement = 87.0-92.9%, respectively). The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis indicated slight discrepancy of both sIgE assays. Conclusions: Both sIgE determination systems demonstrate fair to good performance when compared to SPT depending on type of allergens. The two sIgE determination systems had favorable correlation and agreement."
"Inhibitory effects of mycosporine-2-glycine isolated from a halotolerant cyanobacterium on protein glycation and collagenase activity  2018 The Society for Applied MicrobiologyMycosporine-2-glycine (M2G), isolated from the halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica, was purified and characterized in order to determine its utility as a cosmetic and pharmaceutical ingredient. M2G efficiently inhibited protein crosslinking. The inhibitory activity of M2G was significantly greater than that of the well-known Maillard reaction inhibitor aminoguanidine. In addition, M2G and other known mycosporine-like amino acids inhibited bacterial collagenase activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing that M2G specifically inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which play a critical role in ageing process and age-related diseases. These observations indicate that M2G may have potential therapeutic applications by suppressing the formation of AGEs and inhibiting excess collagenase activity. Significance and Impact of the Study: Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are known as multifunctional natural compounds. The MAA mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G), isolated from the halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica, has potential therapeutic applications for the prevention of skin ageing. Purified M2G was endotoxin-free. M2G had greater inhibitory activity of protein cross-linking compared with well-known inhibitor, aminoguanidine and hindered bacterial collagenase activity. The mechanisms for these inhibitory activities of M2G are discussed in this study."
"BEstream: Batch Capturing with Elliptic Function for One-Pass Data Stream Clustering  2018 Elsevier B.V.Tremendous data have been generated in forms of streaming data and various distributions in most applications in different areas such as business, science, engineering, and medicine. This creates a new problem of space and time complexities where the incoming data can overflow the memory of an analysing machine and the flow of data may contain some scattered portions of data from different clusters. This situation leads to the incorrect clustering results. The challenge of the clustering on streaming data is clustering the data which continuously growing, unstable, and non-existent from time to time. This paper proposed the concept of discard-after-cluster based on the structure of adaptive hyper-elliptic micro-cluster components. Instead of gradually including each datum into its true cluster, a newly proposed set of algorithms capture the data in forms streaming batch and identify the cluster afterwards. The number of micro-clusters can be increased or decreased according to the dynamical distribution of incoming data as well as the overlap conditions of micro-clusters. A set of new recursive functions for updating parameters, checking overlap conditions, removing micro-clusters, and merging micro-clusters after discarding previously clustered data were introduced. The proposed algorithm was tested on synthetic and real data sets. The elliptic-micro-cluster structure is more suitable for capturing data than the other structures in the compared previous methods. In addition, our method named BEstream showed the more efficient results than the previous data stream clustering algorithms based on the rand index and normalized mutual information measures."
"Healthy behaviours and productive activities among Thai older adults: A repeated cross-sectional analysis  2018 Elsevier LtdBased on a nationally representative repeated cross-sectional sample of older individuals from the 2007 and 2011 Surveys of Older Persons in Thailand (n = 50,138, with the participation rate of 95.79%), this study investigates the extent to which healthy behaviours are interrelated with productive activities in old age. Healthy behaviours were represented by alcohol abstinence, tobacco abstinence, physical exercise, and consumption of a nutritious diet, encompassing all major lifestyle choices that could lower mortality risks among the general population. Productive activities were represented by social participation and labour participation, consistent with the paradigms of Active and Productive Ageing promoted by the World Health Organization. A multivariate probit model, whereby all six behaviours were jointly estimated, was explored. Conditional on pairwise combinations of the two productive activities, the probabilities of contemporaneously undertaking all four healthy behaviours were calculated. The results illustrate that the relationships among productive activities and health behaviours are inextricable and complex. Considering each of the four healthy behaviours separately, social participation and labour participation are associated with lower probabilities of abstaining from alcohol and tobacco but higher probabilities of exercising and keeping a nutritious diet among older adults. Considering all four healthy behaviours together, the productive activities are associated with a significant increase in the probability that a Thai older adult would simultaneously abstain from alcohol, abstain from tobacco, exercise, and eat healthily, compared to if the same individual undertakes neither social participation nor labour participation. This study calls for a consistent set of multiple-behaviour interventions to promote healthy and productive ageing."
"Genotype and clinical characteristics of congenital long QT syndrome in Thailand  2018 Indian Heart Rhythm SocietyBackground: Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inheritable arrhythmic disorder which is linked to at least 17 genes. The clinical characteristics and genetic mutations may be variable among different population groups and they have not yet been studied in Thai population. Methods: Clinical characteristics were retrospectively reviewed from children and young adults with congenital long QT syndrome whose blood samples were sent for genotyping during 1998–2017. Sangers sequencing was used to sequentially identify KCNQ1 or KCNH2 genetic variants. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify variants in all other known LQTS genes. Results: Of the 20 subjects (17 families), 45% were male, mean QTc was 550.3 ± 68.8 msec (range 470–731 msec) and total Schwartz's score was 5.6 ± 1.2 points (range 3–8 points). Fifty percent of patients had events at rest, 30% had symptoms after adrenergic mediated events, and 20% were asymptomatic. We discovered pathogenic and likely pathogenic genetic variants in KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A in 6 (35%), 4 (24%), and 2 (12%) families, respectively. One additional patient had variance of unknown significance (VUS) in KCNH2 and another one in ANK2. No pathogenic genetic variant was found in 3 patients (18%). Most patients received beta-blocker and 9 (45%) had ICD implanted. LQT1 patients were either asymptomatic or had stress-induced arrhythmia. Most of the LQT2 and LQT3 patients developed symptoms at rest or during sleep. Conclusions: Our patients with LQTS were mostly symptomatic at presentation. The genetic mutations were predominantly in LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 genes."
"Diesel oil removal by Serratia sp. W4-01 immobilized in chitosan-activated carbon beads  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Serratia sp. W4-01 was immobilized in chitosan-activated carbon beads and used for diesel oil removal. The type and concentration of chitosan, activated carbon content, and bead diameter were investigated as factors affecting diesel oil removal. The results showed that 2% (w/v) squid pen chitosan beads modified with 1% activated carbon (w/v) and with a 3-mm diameter had a good spherical shape and strength as well as diesel oil removal capability. The immobilized W4-01 cells removed more than 40% of diesel oil after 7 days when the initial diesel oil concentration was 100 to 400 mg L−1, whereas 29–36% of diesel oil was removed after 14 days when the initial concentration was 800 to 1000 mg L−1. Additionally, the immobilized cells maintained the ability to remove diesel oil over a pH range of 5–11. The addition of a biosurfactant increased the diesel oil removal from 62 to 75%. The reusability tests revealed that the ability of immobilized cells to remove diesel oil was enhanced after reuse, and 50–90% of diesel oil was removed during 2 to 12 reuse cycles. The stability and survival of W4-01 cells was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results of this study showed the potential use of W4-01 cells immobilized in chitosan-activated carbon beads for future applications in remediating diesel contamination."
"Physical and cognitive functions affecting road traffic injuries among senior drivers  2018 Elsevier B.V.Background: The size of elderly populations is growing in most areas of the world. The Thai Eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan revealed an increase in the elderly, while numbers of younger, working-age adults decreased. Thailand has become an aging society since 2015, which is significant in that senior adults have a higher risk of involvement in motor vehicle accidents and are more susceptible to injuries and fatalities. This study investigated the role of physical and cognitive function with regard to road traffic injury in senior drivers. Methods: A community survey was carried out among people aged 60 years and older in the villages representing four regions of Thailand. Face-to-face interviews and anthropometric measurements were used to gather data including individual characteristics, medical history, risk behaviors, cognitive function and traffic injury within the last 12 months. Associations between risk factors and injury were assessed by the chi-square tests, and comparison of the cognitive function score between the injury and non-injury groups was identified using the independent t-test. Results: A total of 314 completed questionnaires were used for analysis. Ten percent of respondents had experienced a road traffic injury in the last 12 months. Analysis revealed that level of cognitive function, smoking behavior and been diagnosed with arthritis were associated with road traffic injury incidence in senior drivers (p-value < 0.05). Conclusion: Results revealed the potential need for strategies to increase road traffic safety in senior drivers. Special protection should be prioritized for the elderly with physical and cognitive impairment."
"Endotypes of Chronic Rhinosinusitis Across Ancestry and Geographic Regions  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Purpose of Review: Preliminary studies have suggested differences in endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) across ancestry/ethnic groups. Eosinophilic CRS (ECRS) is the predominant subtype for Western/European ancestry CRS patients and non-eosinophilic CRS (nECRS) for Asian patients. This review aims to re-analyze CRS endotypes across ancestry populations using one consistent criteria to existing data. Recent Findings: Although tissue eosinophilia is the most commonly used criterion for ECRS, various cut-off points are suggested. Surrogate markers have been extensively studied. Sixty-six cohorts with study criteria were included with a total of 8557 patients. Raw data from 11 studies 544 patients were re-analyzed using number of tissue eosinophils. At lower cut-off values of ≥ 5 and ≥ 10 cells/HPF, most patients of Asian and Western/European ancestry were classified as ECRS without difference. In contrast, at cut-off points of ≥ 70 and ≥ 120 cells/HPF, the majority of both groups became reclassified as nECRS. Summary: After applying one consistent criteria to existing data, differences across ancestry and geographic populations in endotypes of CRS were no longer evident."

"Biomass gasification integrated with CO2 capture processes for high-purity hydrogen production: Process performance and energy analysis  2018 Elsevier LtdThe performance of an integrated biomass gasification and CO2 capture process to produce H2-rich gas satisfying a PEMFC specification is investigated. Wood residue and CaO are used as a biomass feedstock and a CO2 sorbent, respectively. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed by using ASPEN Plus. The effect of change in major parameters, i.e., gasifying temperature, carbonation temperature and CaO/C ratio, on the product gas composition is investigated. The H2 concentration of the product gas leaving the gasifier is found to increase as the gasifying temperature increases and reaches its maximum value when the gasifying temperature is higher than 700 °C. For the integrated process, the H2 concentration significantly decreases as the carbonation temperature increases to higher than 500 °C. Moreover, the result indicates that the CaO/C ratio should be maintained at a value higher than 3.17 to ensure that the generated CO2 is completely captured. The energetic and exergetic performances, as well as the environmental impact of the integrated process at various amounts of recycled CO2, are also investigated. The energy conversion efficiency and the exergy efficiency based on H2 production increase as the CO2/C ratio increases, whereas the CO2 emission shows the opposite trend. The maximum exergy efficiency of 69.65%, based on the hydrogen production and the heat generation, is achieved at CO2/C and CaO/C ratios of 0.6 and 4.48, respectively. At this condition, a specific emission of CO2 of 4.4 g CO2 - eqMJ- 1 and an energy conversion efficiency of 88.09% are achieved."
"Rapid design and fielding of four diagnostic technologies in Sierra Leone, Thailand, Peru, and Australia: Successes and challenges faced introducing these biosensors  2018Febrile illnesses are among the most common reasons for visits to hospitals and clinics worldwide. Since fevers can arise from a wide range of diseases, identifying the causative pathogen is essential not only for effective personal treatment but also for early detection of outbreaks. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) tasked a coalition of commercial, academic, and government researchers with moving diagnostic technology concepts from ideation to field use as rapidly as possible using scientifically sound evaluations. DTRA's 24 Month Challenge program examined >30 technologies before fielding four technologies on four continents. >10,000 in field test results were recorded. Here we discuss our tiered evaluation system to assess candidate technologies developed by commercial partners and the process of field testing those technologies at various front-line clinics in Sierra Leone, Thailand, Peru, and Australia. We discuss successes and challenges for introducing two multiplexed lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) tests that detect malaria, dengue fever, melioidosis, and the plague. Additionally we discuss the use of a LFI reader that assisted the interpretation of the assay, communicated results to a data cloud, and greatly facilitated reach-back support. Lastly, we discuss the concurrent field testing of a multiplexed PCR assay on the FilmArray platform, which had an assay pouch specially designed for the 24 Month Challenge. Either standard-of-care or gold-standard testing were run alongside our fielded technologies to benchmark their performance."
"Heterogeneously catalyzed transesterification of palm oil with methanol to produce biodiesel over calcined dolomite: The role of magnesium oxide  2018Calcined dolomite, composed of calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO), is a potential solid base catalyst for the transesterification of triglycerides with methanol to produce biodiesel. However, the catalytic role of MgO in the calcined dolomite is not well understood. We studied the effect of calcination conditions on the formation of the metal oxide phases and the catalytic activity of the resulting dolomite-derived mixed metal compounds. Natural calcite with an analogous trigonal-rhombohedral crystal was used for comparison. The surface basicity of the calcined materials was dependent on the type and cluster size of the oxides, which were controlled by varying calcination temperature and heating rate, while their catalytic activity was principally determined by the bulk CaO content. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the growth of MgO on the calcined dolomite, which possessed an oxygen-deficient surface. The generated MgO exhibited a low basicity, low reactivity with methanol and glycerol in phase transformation, and low transesterification catalytic activity under the studied conditions. The oxide materials obtained from the calcite and dolomite calcined at 800 °C exhibited the highest basicity and catalytic activity, giving the FAME yield of >99 wt% under the studied conditions. The CaO nanocrystallites obtained from the dolomite were highly accessible and more reactive than those derived from calcite in the methoxide formation. An in situ formation of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) was observed for the oxide materials directly reacted with methanol or glycerol and those spent in the transesterification. The small crystallites of dolomite-derived mixed oxides maintained the structural stability of Ca(OH)2 as an active phase, resulting in a lower formation of bulk glyceroxides."
"Memory loss and memory reorganization patterns in temporal lobe epilepsy patients undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection, as demonstrated by pre-versus post-operative functional MRI  2018 Elsevier LtdThis study was aimed to longitudinally assess memory function and whole-brain memory circuit reorganization in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) by comparing activation potentials before versus after anterior temporal lobe (ATL) resection. Nineteen patients with medically-intractable TLE (10 left TLE, 9 right TLE) and 15 healthy controls were enrolled. Group analyses were conducted pre- and post-ATL of a novelty complex scene-encoding paradigm comparing areas of blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal activations on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). None of the pre-operative patient characteristics we studied predicted the extent of pre- to post-operative memory loss. On fMRI, extra-temporal activations were detected pre-operatively in both LTLE and RTLE, particularly in the frontal lobe. Greater activations also were noted in the contralateral hippocampus and parahippocampus in both groups. Performing within-subject comparisons, post-op relative to pre-op, pronounced ipsilateral activations were identified in the left parahippocampal gyrus in LTLE, versus the right middle temporal gyrus in RTLE patients. Memory function was impaired pre-operatively but declined after ATL resection in both RTLE and LTLE patients. Post-operative fMRI results indicate possible functional adaptations to ATL loss, primarily occurring within the left parahippocampal gyrus versus right middle temporal gyrus in LTLE versus RTLE patients, respectively."
"From phylogeny to protein dynamics: A computational hierarchical quest for potent drug identification against an emerging enteropathogen “Yersinia enterocolitica”  2018 Elsevier B.V.Yersinia enterocolitica is an enteric bacterium categorized as the third most common cause of bacterial diarrhea in Europe. The pathogen exhibits an intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics, which is exacerbated by the absence of a vaccine. This prompts a quest for novel drug targets, to tackle the alarming threat to human health caused by multiple-drug resistant Y. enterocolitica. Subtractive proteomics have revealed that Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate synthase enzyme is a safe target for novel inhibitors, as it is involved in the pathogen's essential Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate pathway. Structure based virtual screening has led to the identification of a natural drug-like compound, 2-acetyl-3-(2-heptanamidoethyl)-1H-indol-6-yl heptanoate that demonstrated a high affinity to the enzyme active site in docking studies. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in aqueous solution confirm that the compound remains stable in the enzyme's active site throughout the simulation. ASN18 was identified as playing a significant role in mediating strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between the compound and the enzyme active site. Binding free energy calculations using the Molecular Mechanics – Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA) and WaterSwap methods also predict that the compound binds to the enzyme with high affinity. The data from the present work is encouraging and will aid in the discovery of novel antibiotics against this deadly pathogen."
"Direct conversion of simulated propene-rich bio-syngas to liquid iso-hydrocarbons via FT-oligomerization integrated catalytic process  2018 Elsevier LtdThe bio-syngas formed from the catalytic cracking of bio-oil include two types of useful components which are light olefin and H2, CO. The integration of FTS and olefinic polymerization seems potential way for the production of hydrocarbon bio-fuels while fully utilizing the olefin-rich bio-syngas. This work aimed to develop an integrated process for the production of liquid hydrocarbons directly from the olefin-rich bio-syngas through a one-stage process, which included the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons via the oligomerization of light olefin over HZSM-5 along with the FT (Fischer-Tropsch) synthesis of H2, CO over FeMn catalyst. A series of integration configuration composed of Fe-based catalyst (FeMn) and acidic zeolite (HZSM-5) were investigated, it was found that the undesired hydrogenation of lower olefin on the nearby metal active site seems greatly affected the yield of C5+. More significantly, the proximity of the two active components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired hydrogenation reaction and contributing to the high selectivity of liquid hydrocarbons. The optimal catalytic performance yields a high selectivity to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (87.3%) with excellent low olefin hydrogenation selectivity (7.4%). Meanwhile, the obtained gasoline-range hydrocarbon showed high degree of isomerization. The integrated transformation process potentially provides an alternative way for the production of gasoline range isomerized hydrocarbon fuels using olefin-rich bio-syngas."
"Prevalence and determinants risk factors of underweight and overweight among women in Bangladesh  2018 Elsevier LtdObjective: Over the past two decades, the prevalence of underweight and overweight has increased in Bangladesh and become global public health problem. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors of underweight and overweight among women in Bangladesh. What is the level of the prevalence and risk factors among women in Bangladesh? Methods: A cross-sectional study data using from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2011. Data was collected from women in sevens divisions of Bangladesh – Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhet. The total women were 17,684 in seven divisions of Bangladesh. The chi-square test (χ2) and logistic regression model are used to determine are associated and risk factors of underweight and overweight among women in Bangladesh. Results: The prevalence of being underweight and overweight among women aged 15–49 years in Bangladesh was 22.4% and 14.1% respectively. Age, education, region of residence, socioeconomic status and mortality were significantly associated with underweight and overweight. The adjusted logistic regression analysis indicated that, women with socioeconomic status were significantly associated with being underweight (OR = 0.477, 95%CI = 0.409–0.556) and overweight (OR = 0.3.595, 95%CI = 2.796–4.621). In contrast, rural women in Bangladesh had a significantly positive association with being underweight (OR = 1.127, 95%CI = 0.983–1.292) and overweight (OR =.810, 95%CI = 0.682–0.962). The prevalence of underweight and overweight risk factors shows different age, education, socio-economics status and urban-rural difference among women in Bangladesh. Conclusion: The decrease of the prevalence of being underweight and overweight is an essential health education interventions or awareness programs among urban and rural women in Bangladesh. Age, socioeconomic status, mortality and education should be considered when developing interventional strategies to reduce the prevalence of underweight and overweight among women in Bangladesh."
"Detection of Leishmania DNA in saliva among patients with HIV/AIDS in Trang Province, southern Thailand  2018 Elsevier B.V.Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease causing opportunistic infection among patients with HIV/AIDS. The fatal form of this disease is visceral leishmaniasis (VL). DNA of Leishmania can be detected in saliva, for which the collection is noninvasive and requires little expertise. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a nested-PCR to amplify the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) to detect Leishmania DNA in paired saliva and buffy coat samples of 305 Thai patients with HIV/AIDS in Trang Hospital, Trang Province, southern Thailand. For asymptomatic Leishmania infection among Thai patients with HIV/AIDS, the sensitivity and specificity of the nested-PCR-ITS1 in buffy coat were 73.9 and 100%, respectively. However, the sensitivity in saliva was 26.1% and specificity was 100%. Using the nested-PCR-ITS1, saliva and buffy coat samples showed positive agreement in only 52.0% of patients. Saliva tested results with the nested-PCR-ITS1 showed positive agreement with the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) in 46.5% of patients. Only 12.1% of the samples showed positive agreement for Leishmania infection among all the three tests: saliva, buffy coat and DAT results. Using nucleotide sequencing, at least three species of Leishmania infection were identified in saliva, i.e., L. siamensis (n = 28), L. martiniquensis (n = 9), and L. donovani complex (n = 1). As a result, buffy coat still appears to be a better specimen to diagnose asymptomatic VL infection among individuals with HIV. However, the use of both buffy coat and saliva together as clinical specimens would increase the sensitivity of Leishmania detection."
"Insights into the structural features and stability of peptide nucleic acid with a D-prolyl-2-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid backbone that binds to DNA and RNA  2018 Elsevier Inc.Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a powerful biomolecule with a wide variety of important applications. In this work, the molecular structures and binding affinity of PNA with a D-prolyl-2-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid backbone (acpcPNA) that binds to both DNA and RNA were studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The simulated structures of acpcPNA-DNA and acpcPNA-RNA duplexes more closely resembled the typical structures of B-DNA and A-RNA than the corresponding duplexes of aegPNA. The calculated binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental results that the acpcPNA-DNA duplex is more stable than the acpcPNA-RNA duplex regardless of the base sequences. The results provide further insights in the relationship between structure and stability of this unique PNA system."
"A closed-culture system using a GMP-grade culture bag and anti-CD3/28 coated bead stimulation for CD4+ T cell expansion from healthy and HIV-infected donors  2018 Elsevier B.V.CD4 immunotherapy is potentially useful in immune reconstitution of CD4+ T cells for HIV-infected patients. Transfusion of anti-CD3/28 expanded CD4+ T cells is also proved to be safe and effective in both SIV-infected macaques and HIV-infected patients. However, there is no such standardized and practical protocol available for cell production in order to use in clinics. This study thus aimed to develop a closed-culture system for in vitro CD4+ T lymphocyte expansion by using a commercially available GMP-grade culture bag and anti-CD3/28 activation. Freshly isolated CD4+ T cells by immunorosette formation from healthy donors and cryopreserved CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected patients with CD4 count over 500 cells/μL were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 coated beads. The activated cells were then expanded in conventional culture flasks and GMP-grade culture bags for three weeks. Fold expansion, cell viability, growth kinetic and phenotypic characters were observed. Results revealed that purified CD4+ T cells from healthy individuals cultured in flasks showed better expansion than those cultured in bags (797-fold and 331-fold, respectively), whereas, their cell viability, growth kinetic and expanded CD4+ T cell purity were almost similar. A large-scale production was also conducted and supported consistency of cell proliferation in the closed-culture system. Frozen CD4+ T lymphocytes from the patients were able to remain their growth function and well expanded with a good yield of 415-fold, 85% viability and 96% purity of CD4+ T cells at the end of a 3-week culture in bags. This developed closed-culture system using culture bags and anti-CD3/28 coated beads, therefore, can achieve a large number of expanded CD4+ T lymphocytes with good reproducibility, suggesting a promising protocol required for adoptive immunotherapy."
"The Sukhothai Zone (Permian–Triassic island-arc domain of Southeast Asia) in Northern Laos: Insights from Triassic carbonates and foraminifers  2018 International Association for Gondwana ResearchIn mainland Southeast Asia, Permian–Triassic successive subduction of the Paleo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere formed an island-arc system called the Sukhothai Zone, along the margin of the Indochina Block. This zone has been considered to extend from Northern Thailand to southwestern Yunnan of China, but so far lacked concrete evidence from northern Laos in between. This makes basic geotectonic subdivision of mainland Southeast Asia ambiguous. In this study Triassic foraminifers from limestone distributed in the Long area of Luang Namtha Province (northwestern Laos) solve this problem. The relevant limestone has a kilometer-sized extent and was previously assigned to the Carboniferous–Early Permian based only on lithological grounds in regional geological mapping. Its Triassic age is demonstrated for the first time based on foraminifers. We discriminated from this limestone Aulotortus sinuosus, A. tumidus, Ophthalmidium danneri, Endotriada tyrrhenica, Endoteba obturata, Endotebanella kocaeliensis, Diplotremina astrofimbriata, Duostomina biconvexa, and Palaeolituonella majzoni, and concluded that the fauna is referable to the Carnian (early Late Triassic). Cement-rich reefal sediments consisting of Carniphytes multisiphonatus-microbial boundstone and sparse-allochem bioclastic grainstone containing abundant fragments of Plexoramea gracilis are common in this limestone. They suggest open-marine sedimentation on a shallow carbonate platform, possibly comparable to a cement-dominated upper-slope “Tubiphytes” reef environment found elsewhere in the Triassic. In neighboring mainland Thailand, Carnian limestone with similar lithological and paleontological properties is found only in the Doi Long Formation distributed in the Sukhothai Zone. This evidence provides a firm basis for the tectonostratigraphic correlation of the Sukhothai Zone, in northern Laos. Consequently, our study is critical in giving a clue to clarify the distribution and extension in northern Laos of a Permian–Triassic island-arc domain, the Sukhothai Zone, which is one of the major tectonostratigraphic units comprising mainland Southeast Asia. In this paper, we also described two encrusting foraminifers having multi-chambered (septate) shells, which have been seldom documented in Triassic foraminiferal literature."
"Theoretical analysis of orientations and tautomerization of genistein in β-cyclodextrin  2018Genistein is an isoflavone with promising pharmaceutical applications. However, its low water solubility interferes with its potency, and therefore cyclodextrins (CDs) have been considered as possible drug delivery system (DDS). To investigate the complexation mechanism of genistein in cyclodextrin, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on classical potentials and the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) quantum chemical potential. Both classical and quantum chemical MD simulations predict that the phenol ring of genistein is preferentially complexed in the cavity of CD. The complexation process reduces the water-accessible solvation shell, and it is found that a hydrogen bond is formed between genistein and CD. The DFTB-based MD simulations reveal that spontaneous keto-enol tautomerization occurs even within a hundred picoseconds, which suggests that the encapsulated genistein is complexed in the ordinary enol form of the drug molecule. Analyses of the molecular charge distributions suggest that electrostatic interactions partially induce the complex formation, rather than extensive formation of hydrogen bonds."
"Fast, affordable and eco-friendly enzyme kinetic method for the assay of α-ketoglutaric acid in medical product and sports supplements  2018 Elsevier Inc.A novel kinetic method was developed for the quantitation of α-ketoglutaric acid (AKG) in cardioplegic solution and athletic supplements. The assay relied on an enzymatic transamination of AKG and D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine to form 4-hydroxybenzoylformic acid and L-glutamic acid using D-phenylglycine aminotransferase. Since 4-hydroxybenzoylformic acid absorbed UV strongly at 334 nm, the initial rate of the reaction was determined by the increasing absorbance at this wavelength without the need for colorimetric probes or coupling reactions, and this information was used for the construction of a standard curve against AKG concentration. The method showed good linearity (r2 = 0.9994) over an AKG concentration range of 20–160 μM. The limits of detection and quantitation were 4.09 and 13.62 μM respectively. It was simple, inexpensive, accurate and precise, as well as repeatable, and was not interfered with by excipients in the samples. Regarding the environmental friendliness, the method was free from the use of organic solvents or hazardous reagents and required no chemical pre-treatment of samples. The proposed method gave assay results tested in real samples in agreement with the HPLC method and commercial assay kits, therefore being suitable for routine analysis of AKG in quality control laboratories."
"Conceptual design and life cycle assessment of decentralized power generation by HT-PEMFC system with sorption enhanced water gas shift loop  2018 Elsevier LtdIn this work, the decentralized power generation system consisting of a biomass gasifier, high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs), and a sorption enhanced water gas shift reactor (SE-WGS) is investigated. With very low CO2 and CO concentrations in the reformate gas, the unconsumed fuel at the anode outlet stream of HT-PEMFC is possibly recirculated to the sorption enhanced water gas shift reactor to improve the performance and overall system efficiency without an increase in the problematic CO poisoning. The effects of CaO/C ratio, fuel utilization, and anode split ratio are analysed. With the anode recirculation, the operation at higher fuel utilization and anode split ratio improves the hydrogen efficiency and the system efficiency. The environmental impacts of the biomass gasification integrated with the SE-WGS and HT-PEMFCs are analysed and compared to the different decentralized HT-PEMFC systems fuelled by biomass using life cycle assessment methodology. The CaO production process is found to be the main cause of global warming impact and damage to human health and ecosystem quality, and no negative effect on resource depletion is observed for all studied power generation systems fuelled by biomass. The implementation of CO2 capture into the decentralized HT-PEMFC systems to enhance the hydrogen purity and efficiency significantly increases the environmental impact of the systems. Compared to the Thai Mixed Electricity Grid, better global warming impact of power generation from all studied HT-PEMFC systems is observed due to the environmental benefit obtained from the electricity produced from biomass."

"Deproteinized Natural Rubber as an Electrically Controllable, Transdermal Drug-Delivery Patch  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: A soft transdermal drug-delivery (TDD) patch composed of deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR) was fabricated in this work. Sulindac (Sul), an anionic drug, was loaded on the DPNR patch using silicone oil as a plasticizer. The in vitro release-permeation behavior of Sul from the Sul-loaded DPNR patch was studied by using a modified Franz diffusion cell at a pH of 7.4 and temperature of 37 °C. A cytotoxicity test of the DPNR with silicone oil (DPNR-Si) patch was performed, and the viability percentage was 90%. When external electrical potentials of 0–9 V were applied, the maximum amounts of Sul released and permeated from the Sul-loaded DPNR patch were 8.34, 10.16, 11.86, 19.84, 54.73, 70.89, 82.25, and 83.02% for electrical potentials of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 V, respectively. The release and permeation amount of Sul increased with the increasing electrical potential because of the electrorepulsive force, expanded pathway in pigskin, and pore formation in DPNR. Pore formation occurred under an applied electric field, as confirmed by optical micrographs. The porosity percentage increased with the increasing time and electrical potential due to the drug release and permeation and lack of plasticizer. The effect of storage time on the permeation characteristics was studied for 3 months. The release and permeation amount of Sul was 8.61 and 6.80 wt% for storage times of 1 and 3 months, respectively. Thus, the fabricated Sul-loaded DPNR patch is an electrically controllable TDD patch.

"Optimizing Pueraria candollei var. mirifica cell suspension culture for prolonged maintenance and decreased variation of isoflavonoid from single cell lines  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.Isoflavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds that have various biochemical and pharmacological properties. The tuberous roots of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica contain isoflavonoids and are widely used as dietary supplements and in therapeutics. The present study was aimed at producing reliable sources of isoflavonoids from single Pueraria cells and at optimizing a culture medium with increased biomass and isoflavonoid content. The medium optimized for prolonged maintenance of callus was MS medium supplemented with 200 mg/L KH2PO4, 1 mg/L thiamine HCl, 100 mg/L of myo-inositol with 0.2 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and subculturing for 30 days for the highest growth. The amount of isoflavonoids varied among calli obtained from different explants. The highest amounts of puerarin and daidzein were quantified as 0.63 and 1.80 mg/g of dry weight (DW) in the examined suspension cell culture of single clones, whereas daidzein (0.50 mg/g) and genistein (0.03 mg/g) were present in the suspension cell culture obtained from a mixture of cells. The suspension of cell cultures from the same origin gave comparable amounts of isoflavonoids, but cells from different sources showed varied amounts of isoflavonoids. The amount of isoflavonoid also varied depending on the cell age. The present study provided the first evidence of Pueraria cell suspension from single cells and highlighted the importance of screening the starting cells from a single cell line and the cell age prior to the scale-up process to select desired sources of isoflavonoid compounds."
"rs11567842 SNP in SLC13A2 gene associates with hypocitraturia in Thai patients with nephrolithiasis  2018, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.Hypocitraturia is a profound risk for kidney stone formation and recurrence. Sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter-1 (NaDC-1) is a main transporter responsible for citrate reabsorption in renal proximal tubules. To investigate an association of sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter-1 (NaDC-1) polymorphism with hypocitraturia in Thai patients with nephrolithiasis (NL). Exonic SNPs in NaDC-1 were screened in peripheral blood DNA of 13 NL patients. The rs11567842 (A/G) variant was found and further genotyped in 145 NL patients and 115 non-stone forming controls. NL patients had significantly lower level of urinary citrate than the controls. Based on logistic regression, hypocitraturia was significantly associated with urinary stone formation (adjusted OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.63–15.04). Significant association of urinary citrate level with rs11567842 genotype was found only in the NL group. NL patients with GG genotype had significantly higher urinary citrate than those with AA and AG genotypes. GG carrying patients had significantly reduced risk for hypocitraturia (adjusted OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05–0.48, AA as reference). In selected 15 calcium oxalate stone patients, AA carriers had significantly higher intrarenal NaDC-1 mRNA than GG and AG carriers. Homozygous GG of rs11567842 SNP in NaDC-1 gene was a protective genotype for hypocitraturia in kidney stone patients. The findings suggested that patients with AA genotypes were more susceptible to hypocitraturia than those with GG, hence carrying a higher risk for kidney stone recurrence."
"A review of antibiotic prophylaxis protocols in oral and maxillofacial surgery  2018 Asian AOMS(+) ASOMP(+) JSOP(+) JSOMS(+) JSOM(+) and JAMIObjective: To review the current literature on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis and provide comprehensive conclusions for antibiotic protocols in orthognathic surgery, dental implant surgery, and the surgical removal of wisdom teeth. Results and conclusions: The literature revealed that the penicillin group is the most commonly used antibiotic prior to orthognathic surgery, implant surgery, and the removal of wisdom teeth due to its bactericidal effect and that most common pathogens in the oral cavity are susceptible to the penicillins. A preoperative dose of an antibiotic is recommended for all surgical procedures. In contrast, single and extended postoperative antibiotic use remains controversial among clinicians. Clinicians should tailor their use of postoperative antibiotics as is appropriate for each individual case to avoid inappropriate antibiotic use."
"Short dispersal distance of males in a wild white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) population  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Objectives: It has long been recognized that in gibbons both sexes disperse from the natal group. However, the fate of dispersed individuals was rarely documented. Here we provide the first detailed information on sex differences in dispersal patterns by analyzing the spatial genetic structure of a well-known white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) population. Materials and methods: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosomal haplotypes, and autosomal microsatellite genotypes were determined for individuals of the Mo Singto study site, Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. Mantel tests for the three genetic marker types were performed for 17 gibbon groups comprising 23 adult males and 18 adult females. Results: Significant positive Mantel correlations were observed for spatial distance and both autosomal microsatellite-based as well as Y-chromosomal haplotype-based genetic distance among adult males. Neighboring adult males tended to be genetically related and share Y-chromosomal haplotypes. Conversely, no significant Mantel correlations were observed either in autosomal microsatellites or mtDNA among adult females. Discussion: Our results confirm, at a genetic level, hypotheses from long-term demographic observations that white-handed gibbon males of the Mo Singto population primarily disperse into adjacent groups. Instead, females disperse more opportunistically either to adjacent or more distant groups. This sex-specific difference reflects an apparent greater tolerance between males than between females. The higher tolerance of adult males allows the formation of stable multimale groups and facilitates male dispersal into an adjacent group. Stable multifemale groups have never been documented for white-handed gibbons probably due to feeding competition between females."
"Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of orbital and anterior visual pathway lesions  2018Purpose: The accurate diagnosis of orbital and anterior visual pathway lesions has clinical significance. We determined whether dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI could differentiate benign from malignant lesions and compared model-independent and model-dependent methods of data analysis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies of 37 enhancing orbital and anterior visual pathway lesions. The data were processed using model-independent analysis and model-dependent analysis using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model. The time-signal intensity curve and semiquantitative parameters from the model-independent method (area under the curve [AUC] after the initial 60, 90, and 120 s; time to peak; maximum signal enhancement ratio; maximum slope of increase; and washout ratio) and the quantitative parameters from the model-dependent method (Ktrans, kep, and ve) were derived for comparison with pathologic diagnoses. Results: The time-signal intensity curves demonstrated different perfusion characteristics and were classified into 4 types. All the lesions that demonstrated curve types 1 and 4 were benign, while type 3 lesions were significantly associated with malignancy (P = 0.001). AUC60, AUC90, AUC120, and kep were significantly lower in benign lesions than in malignant lesions (P = 0.020, 0.018, 0.015, and 0.018, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that AUC120 yielded the best diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96) in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Conclusions: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is useful in evaluating orbital and anterior visual pathway lesions. The model-independent analysis method is equivalent to the model-dependent method in differentiating benign from malignant lesions."
"Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features in Asian Practice: Perspectives for Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology  2018, The Author(s).The introduction of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) was initiated and promoted by pathologists. Recent Asian studies added new knowledge to the existing literature to aid a better understanding of NIFTP. Our original data and the results of a meta-analysis suggest that the initial rate of NIFTP has been overestimated, averaging 9.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0–12.7%) of all papillary thyroid cancers worldwide. The incidence of NIFTP in the Asian population (1.6%, 95% CI 0.9–2.5%; 7 studies) is significantly lower than that reported in the non-Asian series (13.3%, 95% CI 9.0–18.3%; 18 studies). Such difference could be attributed to various perceptions of histological diagnostic thresholds, different nature of papillary thyroid carcinoma, and different approaches in the management of thyroid nodules. The active surveillance for indeterminate nodules and NIFTP, largely represented in the indeterminate cytologic categories, promoted by Japanese institutions establishes a new paradigm to reduce overtreatment of these patients. The lower prevalence of NIFTP in the Asian series indicates a low impact on the risk of malignancy in cytopathology, as it was demonstrated in our original multi-institutional cohort of thyroid nodules, and may predict a low impact on the performance of commercial molecular tests. Several Korean studies addressed the issue of BRAF mutation in NIFTP, which prompted the current refinement of the diagnostic criteria for NIFTP. Our survey of Asian pathologists found that the term NIFTP has not been universally adopted in the local practice. Endocrine pathologists must promote the new entity through provision of educational activities."
"Factors influencing achievement of regional league division 2 football tournament management  2017 Kasetsart University. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.This research studied factors influencing the achievements of Regional League Division 2 football tournament management. There were two groups of participants: 1) 438 people internally involved with football league tournament organization using the theory of non-probability sampling for purposive sampling, and 2) 1,068 participants related to football matches using the accidental sampling approach. This research employed two sets of questionnaires, one for each participant group, presented in the form of Likert scale and Lisrel (Linear Structure Relation) for the analysis of descriptive analysis and inferential statistics. The analysis showed that both internal and external factors of 1) Management, 2) Marketing mix, 3) Sports science, 4) Politics and government policy, 5) Player selection criteria, and 6) Performance evaluation system influenced the achievements of Regional League Division 2 football tournament management, with all at a high degree. The external factors relating to the management of the team which significantly affected the internal success of football match organization were the Performance evaluation system, Coordination, and Player selection criteria, respectively. These factors positively and significantly affected internal factors at the .01 level. The three external factors were found to indicatively determine 76 percent of the success of football match organization. The external factors relating to the team fan clubs which significantly affected the internal success of football match organization were political policies launched by the government and the processes of sports marketing, respectively. These factors positively and significantly affected internal factors at the .01 level. The two external factors could determine 65 percent of the success of football tournament organization."
"Noncontact pulse wave detection by two-band infrared video-based measurement on face without visible lighting  2018, ISAROB.In this paper, we propose a novel noncontact pulse wave monitoring method that is robust to fluctuations in illumination through use of two-band infrared video signals. Because the proposed method uses infrared light for illumination, the method can be used to detect a pulse wave on a human face without visible lighting. The corresponding two-band pixel values in the video signals can be separated into hemoglobin and shading components by application of a separation matrix in logarithmic space for the two pixel values. Because the shading component has been separated, the extracted hemoglobin component is then robust to fluctuations in the illumination. The pixel values in the region of interest were spatially averaged over all the pixels of each frame. These averaged values were then used to form the raw trace signal. Finally, the pulse wave and the corresponding pulse rate were obtained from the raw trace signal through several signal processing stages, including detrending, use of an adaptive bandpass filter, and peak detection. We evaluated the absolute error rate for the pulse rate between the estimated value and the ground truth obtained using an electrocardiogram. In the experiments, we found that the performance of the proposed method was greatly improved compared with that of conventional methods using single-band infrared video."
"A Randomized Multicenter Trial Comparing Low-Dose Prednisolone Versus Observation for Prevention of Recurrences in Adult Immune Thrombocytopenia  The Author(s) 2018.Adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) commonly relapses after stopping treatments. This may be preventable by low-dose steroids. In this multicenter study, adult patients with ITP who had been responding to corticosteroids were randomized with the 2 strata of newly diagnosed and relapsed ITP to prednisolone 7.5 mg/d or observation for 6 months. Relapses were defined by a platelet count below 30 × 109/L and/or clinical bleeding. There were 75 patients evaluable for the efficacy and 77 for safety. The recurrent ITP comprised 57.3%. During the median follow-up of 42 weeks, there were 20.5% (8/39) and 25% (9/36) of recurrences in the prednisolone and control groups (P =.643), with the hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75 (P =.549). The significant factor that could predict recurrences was relapsed ITP with the HR of 2.79 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-7.64, P =.037). Prednisolone showed a trend toward a benefit in the relapsed subgroup (P =.070). Adverse events were not different (P =.540) and mostly mild. In conclusion, prednisolone maintenance could not prolong relapse-free survival. Relapsed patients deserve further investigations for preventive measures."
"Simplified two-group two-fluid model for three-dimensional two-phase flow Computational Fluid Dynamics for vertical upward flow  2017 Elsevier LtdRecent progress in nuclear thermal-hydraulics simulations has been largely focused on coupling with other computational packages, improved closure models for subcooled boiling and for bubbly flows, and the development of higher-fidelity simulation capabilities (Kulesza et al., 2016). While high-fidelity 3D simulation is important for model validation, scientific understanding, and some design calculations, it can be prohibitively expensive for system design applications or applications involving large geometries. Thus, there is also a need for practical, simplified approaches for those applications. The two-fluid model strikes a balance between detail and computational resources, but requires the accurate specification of several key constitutive models. These include (1) interfacial forces, (2) interfacial area concentration, (3) two-phase turbulence, and (4) wall and bulk boiling and condensation. In many modern CFD packages, uncertainties in the local interfacial area concentration can have strong effects on the ability to predict the other key parameters. This paper demonstrates that the drag force in 3D CFD can be formulated in much the same way as in 1D system analysis codes and that this approach can be used to formulate a model for interfacial area concentration. The method is also applied to two-group approaches to consider the difference in transport properties for different bubble size classes. This approach may open a method to calculate the interfacial forces without the need for interfacial area transport equations. This reduces the number of differential equations and avoids the modeling challenges associated with bubble breakup and coalescence kernels and the need to specify the inlet interfacial area concentration a priori. The new method is expected to decouple the effects of interfacial area uncertainty and calibrated coefficients, and should provide reasonable local bubble diameters for both group-1 and group-2 bubbles. The approaches proposed in this study are applicable to two-phase flow simulations in rather simple geometries such as upward two-phase flow in vertical channels. In view of many applications for upward two-phase flow in vertical channels, including nuclear reactor systems, the proposed methods are considered useful."
"Efficacy and safety of frontline rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone plus bortezomib (VR-CAP) or vincristine (R-CHOP) in a subset of newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma patients medically eligible for transplantation in the randomized, phase 3 LYM-3002 study  2017 The Author(s).This post-hoc subanalysis of the LYM-3002 phase 3 study assessed the efficacy and safety of substituting vincristine in rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (R-CHOP; n=42) for bortezomib (VR-CAP; n=38) in a subgroup of 80 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients aged<60 years who did not receive stem cell transplantation (SCT) despite medical eligibility. Complete response (CR)/unconfirmed CR (CRu) rates were 67 vs. 39% (odds ratio 3.69 [95% CI(confidence interval): 1.31, 10.41]; p=.012). After 40 months median follow-up, median progression-free survival by independent radiology committee with VR-CAP vs. R-CHOP was 32.6 vs. 12.0 months (hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% CI: 0.31, 1.13]; p=.108); median overall survival was not reached vs. 47.3 months (HR 0.81 [95% CI: 0.33, 1.96]; p=.634). Adverse events included neutropenia (92/76%), thrombocytopenia (70/10%) and leukopenia (65/50%). VR-CAP represents a potential alternative to R-CHOP in combined and/or alternating regimens for younger, SCT-eligible MCL patients."
"Characteristics of pericytes in diethylstilbestrol (DES)-induced pituitary prolactinoma in rats  2018, The Japanese Society for Clinical Molecular Morphology.Prolactinomas are the most common tumor of the human pituitary. They result in excessive prolactin secretion and important changes in the vasculature. Pericytes are perivascular cells associated with capillaries and have crucial roles in physiological and pathological neovascularization. We previously reported that pericytes produce type I and III collagens in the anterior pituitary of adult rats. In addition, pituitary pericytes contained well-developed cell organelles and actively synthesized collagens during early postnatal development. However, the characteristics of pericytes in pituitary tumors are unclear. In this study, we used diethylstilbestrol (DES)-treated rats as an animal model of prolactinoma. Using five common pericyte markers, more pericytes were observed in rats treated with DES for 3 months (prolactinoma) compared to the control. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that attached and semidetached pericytes exhibited active cell organelles. Moreover, we identified pericyte migration between capillaries. Although the fine structure of pituitary pericytes was active in prolactinoma, expressions of type I and III collagen mRNAs were greatly diminished. In sum, the characteristics and functions of pericytes were altered in pituitary tumors. This study is the first to clarify fine structural changes of pericytes in rat prolactinomas and improves our understanding of the function of pericytes under pathological conditions."
"Discriminative sensing performances of ZSM-5, Y, mordenite, ferrierite, beta, 3A, 4A, 5A, and 13X zeolites towards sulfur dioxide  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The present work is an attempt in identifying highly selective sensing materials for sulfur dioxide (SO2). The responses of various zeolites towards SO2 were investigated through the change in the electrical conductivity during the exposure to SO2 under the effects of the zeolite type, cation type, and Si/Al ratio. The zeolites were characterized by BET, FT-IR, XRD, and AAS techniques. Among all zeolites, the NH4 +ZSM-5 with the Si/Al ratio of 23 (NH4 +ZSM-5 (23)) showed the highest positive response towards SO2 with full reversibility. The cyclic response and the SO2 concentration dependence were also investigated. The relative response increased with increasing SO2 concentration. The NH4 +ZSM-5 (23) exhibited a reliable relative response towards SO2 down to 50 ppm. Furthermore, the pristine NH4 +ZSM-5 (23) was ion-exchanged with metal chloride solutions (NaCl, MgCl2, or AlCl3) to study the effect of ion valence on the sensing performance of the ion-exchanged zeolites. The ion-exchanged zeolite with Al3+ possessed the higher relative response towards SO2 at the same ion-exchange percentage than Mg2+ and Na+ due to its higher ionic charge and electronegativity. The interactions among the zeolites and the SO2 molecules were examined and proposed via infrared spectroscopy. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Influence of thiol groups on the ethylene adsorption and conductivity properties of the modified porous clay heterostructures (PCHS) using as ethylene scavenger in smart packaging  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Porous Clay Heterostructures (PCHs) were prepared by the surfactant-directed assembly of silica source (tetraethylorthosilicate–TEOS) and sodium–bentonite (Na-BTN) clay. These PCHs were subsequently modified to an organic–inorganic hybrid material by the co-condensation reaction of TEOS with (3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane (MPTMS) in 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 molar ratios of MPTMS to TEOS to obtain conductive porous clays, here referred to as modified MPPCHs. Various weight percentage of MPPCHs at 1, 3, and 5 wt% were blended with polypropylene (PP) and fabricated into the PP/modified MPPCHs nanocomposite films. Analysis revealed that the surface areas of modified MPPCHs increased significantly from Na–BTN; however, the higher MPTMS contents resulted in less porous surface areas. An ethylene adsorption study showed that modified MPPCHs exhibited higher adsorption efficiency of ethylene gas than that of Na–BTN due to the non-polar property of the modified functional groups. Subsequently, the electrical conductivity of the modified MPPCHs with various contents of thiol group was investigated to evaluate potential use in ethylene scavenger/sensor applications."
"The masseteric nerve: An anatomical study in Thai population with an emphasis on its use in facial reanimation  2017Background: The use of the masseteric nerve has been escalated as a donor nerve for facial reanimation in facial palsy patient (Wang et al., 2014; Manktelow et al., 2006; Klebuc, 2011; Bianchi et al., 2012; Zuker et al., 2000; Bae et al., 2006; Terzis, Konofaos, 2013; Terzis, Olivares, 2009; Bianchi et al., 2014). Previous studies had been done in Euro-Caucasian cadavers (Kaya et al., 2014). However, difference in anatomical details does exist between Asian and Euro-Caucasian population (Tzou et al., 2005; Farkas et al., 2005). In this study, we have conducted a detailed anatomical study of masseteric nerve in adult Thai cadavers which might elaborate better details of masseteric nerve anatomy in Asian population. Methods: Twenty eight hemifaces from 14 adult Thai non-formaldehyde preserved soft cadavers were used in this study. The anatomical pathway of the masseteric nerve was defined relating to four surgical landmarks which are auricular tragus, zygomatic arch, posterior border of the temporomandibular joint, and alar base. Results: The suitable starting area for the masseteric nerve dissection is 3.7 ± 0.4 cm anterior to the auricular tragus at the level of 0.8 ± 0.2 cm inferior to the zygomatic arch. The nerve was found 1.1 ± 0.2 cm deep to the superficial surface of the masseteric fascia and 1.7 ± 0.2 cm anterior to the posterior border of the temporomandibular joint. The point where the nerve giving off its first branch as it courses distally is 7.3 ± 0.7 cm from the ipsilateral alar base. The mean diameter of this nerve is 1.59 ± 0.42 mm. Conclusion: The anatomy of the masseteric nerve during its course in the muscle is consistent. In our study, the details of its anatomy is slightly different from the previous works which were performed in the Euro-Caucasian cadavers."
"Insulin does not rescue cortical and trabecular bone loss in type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats  2017, The Physiological Society of Japan and Springer Japan KK.In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the decreased bone strength is often associated with hyperglycemia and bone cell insulin resistance. Since T2DM is increasingly reported in young adults, it is not known whether the effect of T2DM on bone would be different in young adolescents and aging adults. Here, we found shorter femoral and tibial lengths in 7-month, but not 13-month, Goto-Kakizaki (GK) T2DM rats as compared to wild-type rats. Bone µCT analysis showed long-lasting impairment of both cortical and trabecular bones in GK rats. Although insulin treatment effectively improved hyperglycemia, it was not able to rescue trabecular BMD and cortical thickness in young adult GK rats. In conclusion, insulin treatment and alleviation of hyperglycemia did not increase BMD of osteopenic GK rats. It is likely that early prevention of insulin resistance should prevail over treatment of full-blown T2DM-related osteopathy."
"Drug-induced stevens-johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis call for optimum patient stratification and theranostics via pharmacogenomics Copyright  2018 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.The Global Genomic Medicine Collaborative, a multinational coalition of genomic and policy experts working to implement genomics in clinical care, considers pharmacogenomics to be among the first areas in genomic medicine that can provide guidance in routine clinical practice, by linking genetic variation and drug response. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe life-threatening reactions to medications with a high incidence worldwide. Genomic screening prior to drug administration is a key opportunity and potential paradigm for using genomic medicine to reduce morbidity and mortality and ultimately eliminate one of the most devastating adverse drug reactions. This review focuses on the current understanding of the surveillance, pathogenesis, and treatment of SJS/TEN, including the role of genomics and pharmacogenomics in the etiology, treatment, and eradication of preventable causes of drug-induced SJS/TEN. Gaps, unmet needs, and priorities for future research have been identified for the optimal management of drug-induced SJS/TEN in various ethnic populations. Pharmacogenomics holds great promise for optimal patient stratification and theranostics, yet its clinical implementation needs to be cost-effective and sustainable."
"Nitric oxide promotes cancer cell dedifferentiation by disrupting an Oct4:caveolin-1 complex: A new regulatory mechanism for cancer stem cell formation  2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are unique populations of cells that can self-renew and generate different cancer cell lineages. Although CSCs are believed to be a promising target for novel therapies, the specific mechanisms by which these putative therapeutics could intervene are less clear. Nitric oxide (NO) is a biological mediator frequently up-regulated in tumors and has been linked to cancer aggressiveness. Here, we search for targets of NO that could explain its activity. We find that it directly affects the stability and function of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), known to drive the stemness of lung cancer cells. We demonstrated that NO promotes the CSC-regulatory activity of Oct4 through a mechanism that involves complex formation between Oct4 and the scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). In the absence of NO, Oct4 forms a molecular complex with Cav-1, which promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of Oct4. NO promotes Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Cav-1 at tyrosine 14, disrupting the Cav-1:Oct4 complex. Site-directed mutagenesis and computational modeling studies revealed that the hydroxyl moiety at tyrosine 14 of Cav-1 is crucial for its interaction with Oct4. Both removal of the hydroxyl via mutation to phenylalanine and phosphorylation lead to an increase in binding free energy (Gbind) between Oct4 and Cav-1, destabilizing the complex. Together, these results unveiled a novel mechanism of CSC regulation through NO-mediated stabilization of Oct4, a key stem cell transcription factor, and point to new opportunities to design CSC-related therapeutics."
"Coregulation of Biosynthetic Genes and Transcription Factors for Aporphine-Type Alkaloid Production in Wounded Lotus Provides Insight into the Biosynthetic Pathway of Nuciferine  2018 American Chemical Society.Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) contains various bioactive compounds, with benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) as one of the major groups. The biosynthetic pathways of two major bioactive BIAs in this plant, nuciferine and N-nornuciferine, are still not clear. Therefore, several genes related to BIA biosynthesis were searched from the lotus database to study the role of key genes in regulating these pathways. In this study, the expression profiles of NCS, CNMT, 6OMT, CYP80G2, and WRKY TFs were investigated in mechanically wounded lotus leaves. It was found that the accumulation of nuciferine and N-nornuciferine significantly increased in the mechanically wounded lotus leaves in accordance with the relative expression of putative CYP80G2 and one WRKY transcription factor (NNU-24385), with the coregulation of CNMT. Furthermore, the role of methyltransferase-related genes in this study suggested that methylation of the isoquinoline nucleus to yield a methylated-BIA structure may occur at the N position before the O position. Altogether, this study provides improved understanding of the genes regulating BIA biosynthesis under stressed conditions, which could lead to improvements in BIA production from the commercial lotus."
"Undrained lateral capacity of rectangular piles under a general loading direction and full flow mechanism ⓒ2018 Korean Society of Civil Engineers.New upper and lower bound solutions of undrained lateral capacity of rectangular piles under a general loading direction and full flow mechanism were investigated by using finite element limit analysis with plane strain condition. The true collapse loads of this problem were generally bracketed by computed upper and lower bound solutions to within 3%. Results were summarized in the form of three dimensionless variables, including soil–pile adhesion factor, pile aspect ratio, and lateral loading direction. Predicted failure mechanisms of laterally loaded rectangular piles associated with these parameters were examined and discussed. Approximate equations of failure envelopes for rectangular piles under a general loading direction were proposed for a convenient and accurate prediction of their undrained lateral capacity in practice."
"Antioxidant of green tea and pickle tea product, miang, from northern Thailand Consumption of tea offers health benefits attributed to phenolic compounds. In Thailand, tea mostly belongs to Camellia sinensis var. assamica which is grown in the northern region. Although, Assam tea cultivation is for tea manufacture, it is also originally grown as part of the forest and is being recognized as agroforestry system. Local northern Thais commonly use mature tea leaves to make a pickle tea product called 'miang' to chew on during working hours (similar to chewing tobacco) and as a common household guest reception snack. While this product still has low economic value, it is gradually gaining more attention from Thai researchers due to its health benefit potential. This study aims to investigate phenolic content in miang in comparison to the benchmark green tea product. A sample of freshly picked tea shoots (the first top 3 leaves) and mature tea leaves (leaves 4-6 from top) and the processed products from tea shoots and mature tea leaves (green tea and miang, respectively) from the same crop were compared in terms of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity measured by FRAP and ORAC assay. The results indicated lower content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity measured by both assays in mature tea leaves compared to tea shoots. However, when green tea and miang were extracted under conditions that mimic normal consumption manner, i.e., brewing for green tea and grinding for miang, the results showed that miang had a comparable amount of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The results from the same extraction conditions between green tea and miang is also provided in this paper."
"Effect of storage temperature on antioxidant activities of Citrus medica L. var. limetta Citrus medica L. var. limetta is commonly known as citron or somsa in Thailand. It is a local fruit in Thailand. Its leaf and peel provide a unique aroma oil and flavour. The peel provides flavor and aroma in several Thai recipes. In addition, it is believed to have medicinal effect on sore throat, cough and sputum. In contrast to its wide applications, somsa is not widely utilised due to limited availability which leads to few studies of somsa. The objectives of this study were to study antioxidant activity in different parts of somsa (peel, segment, and seed) and to compare fresh with 3-months stored somsa as well as with other fruits from the Citrus genus. The methods of analysis were ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and Folin-Ciocalteu assay (total phenolic compounds), respectively. The results showed that the antioxidant activity in all parts of stored somsa was increased. Peel of stored somsa increased from 5.86 to 11.12 µM TE g-1 in FRAP assay, segment of stored somsa increased from 2.91 to 34.09 µg GAE g-1 in TP and seed sample increased from 0.88 to 1.94 µM TE g-1 in DPPH. This indicated the occurrence of new compounds which exhibited antioxidant activities during storage showing by changes in color and flavor. Therefore, 3 months storage of somsa at elevated temperature could be an alternative way to increase antioxidant activities compared to fresh sample."
"Imaging genetics paradigms in depression research: Systematic review and meta-analysis  2018 Elsevier Inc.Imaging genetics studies involving participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) have expanded. Nevertheless, findings have been inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging genetics studies that enrolled MDD participants across major databases through June 30th, 2017. Sixty-five studies met eligibility criteria (N = 4034 MDD participants and 3293 controls), and there was substantial between-study variability in the methodological quality of included studies. However, few replicated findings emerged from this literature with only 22 studies providing data for meta-analyses (882 participants with MDD and 616 controls). Total hippocampal volumes did not significantly vary in MDD participants or controls carrying either the BDNF Val66Met ‘Met’ (386 participants with MDD and 376 controls) or the 5-HTTLPR short 's’ (310 participants with MDD and 230 controls) risk alleles compared to non-carriers. Heterogeneity across studies was explored through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Gender distribution, the use of medications, segmentation methods used to measure the hippocampus, and age emerged as potential sources of heterogeneity across studies that assessed the association of 5-HTTLPR short 's’ alleles and hippocampal volumes. Our data also suggest that the methodological quality of included studies, publication year, and the inclusion of brain volume as a covariate contributed to the heterogeneity of studies that assessed the association of the BDNF Val66Met ‘Met’ risk allele and hippocampal volumes. In exploratory voxel-wise meta-analyses, MDD participants carrying the 5-HTTLPR short 's’ allele had white matter microstructural abnormalities predominantly in the corpus callosum, while carriers of the BDNF Val66Met ‘Met’ allele had larger gray matter volumes and hyperactivation of the right middle frontal gyrus compared to non-carriers. In conclusion, few replicated findings emerged from imaging genetics studies that included participants with MDD. Nevertheless, we explored and identified specific sources of heterogeneity across studies, which could provide insights to enhance the reproducibility of this emerging field."
"Adsorption of hydrogen and hydrogen–containing gases on Pd– and Ag–single atoms doped on anatase TiO 2 (1 0 1) surfaces and their sensing performance  2018 Elsevier B.V. The Pd– and Ag–doped anatase TiO 2 (1 0 1) surfaces were investigated and the binding energies of single atom of Pd (−2.15 eV) and Ag (−2.38 eV) on the anatase (1 0 1) surfaces, respectively denoted as Pd/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 were obtained. Binding sites for Pd and Ag atoms toward the TiO 2 surface atoms are three atoms (Ti 5C and two O 2C atoms) and two O 2C atoms of the TiO 2 (1 0 1) surface, respectively. Due to adsorptions of H 2 and hydrogen–containing (H 2 O, NH 3 , and CH 4 ) gases on the Pd/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , adsorption abilities on the Pd/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 are in decreasing orders: NH 3 > H 2 O > H 2 > CH 4 and NH 3 > H 2 O > CH 4 > H 2 , respectively. Mulliken–charge transfers from the Pd and Ag atoms to adsorption atoms of the anatase TiO 2 (1 0 1) surface and the adsorption of hydrogen and hydrogen–containing gases to the Pd/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 were observed. The Pd/TiO 2 and/or Ag/TiO 2 have high potentials to be NH 3 sensing materials based on the electric conductivity measurement. The Pd/TiO 2 has high potential to be CH 4 sensing device based on the electric conductivity and surface charge measurements."
"Fabrication of yttria stabilized zirconia thin films on powder-injected anode substrates by electrophoretic deposition technique for solid oxide fuel cell application  2018 Elsevier B.V.The aim of this study was to fabricate yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin films on the porous anode substrates for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application using environmentally-friendly chemicals and no pre-sintering requirement together with the scalable and cost-effective fabrication techniques. Therefore, 8 mol% YSZ thin films were deposited by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique on the porous NiO-YSZ anode substrates prepared by powder injection molding (PIM) method. The effects of EPD conditions on the electrolyte microstructures were investigated, and the half-cell fabrication parameters and co-sintering temperature were subsequently optimized. The dense YSZ thin films at the thicknesses of 2.12 and 2.93 μm with the full coverage of the porous substrates were obtained at the applied voltage of 30 V for 90 and 120 s, respectively, at the co-sintering temperatures of 1250 °C. The open circuit voltages (OCV) of 0.98–1.06 V were achieved at the operating temperature of 800 °C (as compared to theoretical OCV of 1.14 V), which in turn confirm the high-density YSZ films. Although the anode porosity and pore interconnectivity needed to be further improved for higher SOFC power density, the obtained half-cells already showed the potential of the EPD-PIM combined fabrication methods for the future upscale and cost-effective SOFC production."
"Observation of the χb1 (3P) and χb2 (3P) and Measurement of their Masses  2018 CERN.The χb1(3P) and χb2(3P) states are observed through their (3S)γ decays, using an event sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The data were collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 80.0 fb-1. The (3S) mesons are identified through their dimuon decay channel, while the low-energy photons are detected after converting to e+e- pairs in the silicon tracker, leading to a χb(3P) mass resolution of 2.2 MeV. This is the first time that the J=1 and 2 states are well resolved and their masses individually measured: 10513.42±0.41(stat)±0.18(syst) MeV and 10524.02±0.57(stat)±0.18(syst) MeV; they are determined with respect to the world-average value of the ~(3S) mass, which has an uncertainty of 0.5 MeV. The mass splitting is measured to be 10.60±0.64(stat)±0.17(syst) MeV."
"Noise suppression using amplitude-shaping OCDM with 16-Chip multi-level phase-shifted En/Decoder  2013 IEEE.We propose an amplitude-shaping (AS) technique to shape an en/decoded signal in 10-Gb/s coherent time-spreading optical-code division multiplexing (OCDM) with ON- OFF keying modulation format, using 16-chip multi-level phase-shifted keying en/decoders. By employing this technique, the primary beat noise and the multiple access interference can be suppressed, and the code detection performance is improved. The bit error rate and the power penalty of the 8×10 Gb/s AS-OCDM, obtained from the calculation and the simulation, are improved, in comparison with the conventional OCDM system."
"GARCH(1,1) model of the financial market with the minkowski metric  2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.We solve a stylised fact on a long memory process of the volatility cluster phenomena by using the Minkowski metric for GARCH(1,1) (generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) under the assumption that price and time cannot be separated. We provide a Yang-Mills equation in financial market and an anomaly on superspace of time series data as a consequence of the proof from the general relativity theory. We use an original idea in the Minkowski spacetime embedded in Kolmogorov space in time series data with the behaviour of traders. The result of this work is equivalent to the dark volatility or the hidden risk fear field induced by the interaction of the behaviour of the trader in the financial market panic when the market crashes."
"Imaging improvement in angle-domain common-image-gathers by a local stack utilizing segmentation method  2018 SEGPoynting vector based reverse time migration (PVRTM) can migrate seismic data into angle-domain common-image gathers (ADCIGs). The quality of common-image-gather is related to the used migration velocity. However, in the seismic data processing, we usually cannot obtain a very accurate depth migration velocity. The difference between the true depth velocity and estimated migration velocity would introduce image artifacts, which are often observed as non-flat events in the ADCIGs. These non-flat events will degrade the final image that is linearly stacked from all angles. To mitigate such image artifacts caused by the inaccurate migration velocity, we can use both quantitative and qualitative methods to optimize the stacking. The quantitative method uses a numerical method to achieve an optimal velocity model for migration. However, there is residual moveout error still left in the gathers. Instead, we propose a qualitative method to assure geologically meaningful result, so-called segmentation method using Moore neighborhood algorithm, which can decompose events in the ADCIGs into isolated signal groups. From this sequestered image domain, signals can manifest easier because of dealing only local signals that do not interfere with adjacent ones. We can automatically align concave events and focus stretching amplitudes at far angles. Additionally, we do not need cross-correlation to measure the moveout of non-flat events. Consequently, we can avoid the mismatching among the events at different depths. We test our proposed method by one numerical dataset. The numerical results show that the ADCIGs can correct the non-flat events in the ADCIGs from small angle to large angle. Compared with the tradition RTM with Laplace filtering and small angle stacking, our new method can produce a superior migration image with fewer artifacts. In practice, this proposed method can reduce the requirement of migration velocity accuracy in the depth velocity building and provide a first-look of RTM image."
"Application of Sensor Technology for Warning Unsafe Conditions from Moving Objects above Construction Workers  2018 IEEE.Moving objects above construction workers is one of the major causations of accidents at construction sites. The dynamic and complex nature of construction sites can lead to the above unsafe conditions. However, previous research has developed sensor system for detecting the accident which can only be applied to crane prototype in laboratory. The objective of this research is to develop a sensor warning system (SW system) for warning construction workers from unsafe conditions. This study focuses on a lifting operation of the tower crane. The SW system is developed based on the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, GPS sensor, and server. In this paper, the pilot test was conducted on testing GPS devices which could lead to determine the distance error and calibrate the system. As a result, the average of distance error was 1.96 meters for calibrating the system. Further study will continue to develop the full-scale system which can be applied to construction site."
"Shaft Crack Monitoring by Using Acoustic Emission Technique  2018 IEEE.A power transmission shaft in rotational machines is a relatively important part of most applications. Frequently, fluctuated temperature, machine overload, and fatigue stress cause shaft cracking and finally broken that lead to machine breakdown and may damage some other mechanical components. Therefore, the shaft crack detection system using Acoustic Emission (AE) was developed in this study in order to prevent machine breakdown and subsequent damages. A test rig was designed and used for an endurance test. A notched shaft under radial bending fatigue was tested until its failure. An AE sensor mounted on a sleeve was monitored in real time to detect stress waves in terms of AE signal from crack initiation. The AE signal was amplified and transmitted to a personal computer via a data acquisition card. AE signal features were extracted to indicate the crack initiation and propagation. Using AE technique proposed in this study can successfully indicate shaft cracking at the early stage before its failure."
"Comparing Filtering Techniques in Restaurant Recommendation System  2018 IEEE.This paper studies the key analytics of the restaurant recommendation system, namely predicting restaurant satisfaction rating based on customer and restaurant characteristics. As food industry grows and offers more variety of restaurants, customers generally have difficulty discovering a restaurant that suits or satisfies them. This paper aims to predict restaurant satisfaction rating based on three methodologies: content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering. For content-based filtering, this paper proposes using regression to create a prediction model from customer and restaurant characteristics. For collaborative filtering, our proposed model employs a combination of cluster analysis, similarity test, and weighted sum in order to analyze factors that influence the satisfaction rating. Cluster analysis helps to reduce the impact of sparsity in collaborative filtering. Subsequently, hybrid filtering is proposed to combine the results from the two techniques above to generate the final rating. Our results have shown that hybrid filtering outperforms content-based filtering using regression model and collaborative filtering using cluster-based technique."
"Movie Revenue Prediction Using Regression and Clustering  2018 IEEE.Among many movies that have been released, some generate high profit while the others do not. This paper studies the relationship between movie factors and its revenue and build prediction models. Besides analysis on aggregate data, we also divide data into groups using different methods and compare accuracy across these techniques as well as explore whether clustering techniques could help improve accuracy. Specifically, two major steps were employed. Initially, linear regression, polynomial regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied on the entire movie data to predict the movie revenue. Then, clustering techniques, such as by genre, using Expectation Maximization (EM) and using K-means were applied to divide data into groups before regression analyses are executed. To compare accuracy among different techniques, R-square and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used as a performance indicator. Our study shows that generally linear regression without clustering offers the model with the highest R-square, while linear regression with EM clustering yields the lowest RMSE."
"Influence of Anodizing Current on Structure and Color Intensity of Anodized Aluminium Alloys  2018 IEEE.The study focuses on the effect of current density on physical and electrochemical properties of anodized 7075 aluminium alloys. Microstructural observation of the anodized specimen was performed using optical-and field emission scanning electron microscope. Spectrophotometer and potentiostat were used for investigation of color appearance and corrosion resistance, respectively. Difference in anodizing current density plays important role on the quality of microstructure, corrosion resistance and color intensity. Higher surface roughness of the layers, caused by large current density of anodizing process, was found to enhance a color intensity of specimen with a reduction of corrosion resistance. In the study, the optimized current density for producing high corrosion resistance is at 14 mA/cm2"
"Design and Development of an Assistive Hand Device for Enhancing Compatibility and Comfortability  2018 IEEE.Currently, there are plenty of hand exoskeletons for rehabilitation and assistive purpose that have been developed. They have been designed for working with patient's limbs and can be used for hand positioning and executing task which help reduce therapist's workload and give them an alternative way to rehabilitate patients. However, there are some patients with permanent impairments, which cannot improve from rehabilitation. Thus, portable assistive devices could greatly help them performing simple activities of daily living (ADL), but such device has not been fully explored, the present design of tendon routing cannot closely replicate finger orientation and motion during grasping. Improving the flexion tendon would increase the possibility of grasping for patients with hand disability. This research aims to develop a tendon routing design of a soft exoskeleton to increase compatibility with human hand, while it can execute tasks and exercises more naturally compared to normal limbs to help stroke patients to live independently. The results convinced that the proposed flexion routing can closely replicate human grasping motion with sufficient fingertip force to perform daily activities."
"IR-Compatible PDMS microfluidic devices for monitoring of enzyme kinetics  2018 Elsevier B.V.Coupling infrared (IR) spectroscopy to microfluidic devices provides a powerful tool for characterizing complex chemical and biochemical reactions. Examples of microfluidic devices coupled with infrared spectroscopy have been limited, however, largely due to the difficulties associated with fabricating systems in common infrared transparent materials like CaF2. Recent reports have shown that polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) can be used as an IR transparent substrate when fabricated with thin layers. The use of soft lithography with PDMS expands the library of possible designs that can be achieved for IR measurements in microfluidics. In initial reports with thin PDMS, the target analytes were small molecules; however, IR spectroscopy offers a powerful tool to study protein structure and reactions. Here, a PDMS microfluidic device compatible with IR spectroscopy was fabricated by means of spin-coating of PDMS pre-polymer to obtain thin PDMS microfluidic features. The device was comprised of only PDMS and IR absorption of PDMS was significantly minimized due to the thickness (∼40 μm) of the PDMS layer. The use of thin PDMS allowed for measuring the amide I and II vibrational bands of proteins that have been difficult to measure in other microfluidic devices. To demonstrate the power of the system, the microfluidic device was successfully used to measure the enzyme kinetics as one class of important biochemical reactions with broad use in a variety of fields from medicine to biotechnology. As a model, the reaction of glucose oxidase with glucose was tracked by following the formation of gluconic acid. Michaelis-Menten kinetics from the device were compared with bulk solution measurements and found to be in good agreement."
"Risk profiles and pattern of antithrombotic use in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in Thailand: A multicenter study  2018 The Author(s). Background: Anticoagulation therapy is a standard treatment for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) that have risk factors for stroke. However, anticoagulant increases the risk of bleeding, especially in Asians. We aimed to investigate the risk profiles and pattern of antithrombotic use in patients with NVAF in Thailand, and to study the reasons for not using warfarin in this patient population. Methods: A nationwide multicenter registry of patients with NVAF was created that included data from 24 hospitals located across Thailand. Demographic data, atrial fibrillation-related data, comorbid conditions, use of antithrombotic drugs, and reasons for not using warfarin were collected. Data were recorded in a case record form and then transferred into a web-based system. Results: A total of 3218 patients were included. Average age was 67.3 ± 11.3 years, and 58.2% were male. Average CHADS 2 , CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, and HAS-BLED score was 1.8 ± 1.3, 3.0 ± 1.7, and 1.5 ± 1.0, respectively. Antiplatelet was used in 26.5% of patients, whereas anticoagulant was used in 75.3%. The main reasons for not using warfarin in those with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥2 included already taking antiplatelet (26.6%), patient preference (23.1%), and using non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (22.7%). Anticoagulant was used in 32.3% of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc 0, 56.8% of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc 1, and 81.6% of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥2. The use of NOACs increased from 1.9% in 2014 to 25.6% in 2017. Conclusions: Anticoagulation therapy was prescribed in 75.3% of patients with NVAF. Among those receiving anticoagulant, 90.9% used warfarin and 9.1% used NOACs. The use of NOACs increased over time."
"Diagnosis of Heart Disease Using a Mixed Classifier  2017 IEEE.Nowadays, a large amount of medical information can be used to help for medical diagnosis. Especially in computer science, many researchers attempt to use data mining techniques for analyzing large amount of data to discover pattern or knowledge from those data. In this study, a classification technique with supervised learning is considered. From the preliminary study, each classification technique yields different performance. With this reason, a new classification model that combines the advantage of individual classifiers is proposed to achieve higher performance. The proposed model consists of two classification stages. Three techniques composed of Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method and Naïve Bayes approach are applied to an instance separately for the first stage. Then, the results from the techniques will be fed into multi-layer perceptron with back-propagation learning for the second classification stage. Moreover, heart disease, one of the leading causes of death in Thailand, has been selected for diagnosis in this study. A dataset of the disease consists of two classes: risk and non-risk. From the experimental results, the proposed model mixed from three techniques outperforms the existing classifiers including the individual techniques."
"C-Anomalous Assemblage Detection to Recognize Outliers Using kth-Nearest Neighbor Distance  2017 IEEE.A C-anomalous assemblage is a group of associated outliers having the number of instances less than C percent of the total. Presently, known anomaly detection algorithms hardly detect these assemblages without appropriate setting. This paper proposes the new anomalous assemblage detection algorithm called CND which computes a score for an instance using a nearest neighbor distance. The algorithm computes the index k which is equal to the floor function of C percent times the total number of instances and uses the kth-nearest neighbor distance for representing an anomalous score. Moreover, a medcouple from a skew distribution is used to compute the upper threshold for detecting outliers. The algorithm is tested on two collections of datasets which are synthetic datasets and benchmark datasets from Multimedia Analysis and Data Mining website to evaluate the performance comparing with WOF and LOF. The performance of CND is similar to LOF, but it is better than the performance of WOF on the synthetic dataset based on precision' recall and F1-measure."
"Elliptic Flow of Charm and Strange Hadrons in High-Multiplicity p+Pb Collisions at sNN =8.16 TeV  2018 CERN.The elliptic azimuthal anisotropy coefficient (v2) is measured for charm (D0) and strange (KS0, Λ, Ξ-, and Ω-) hadrons, using a data sample of p+Pb collisions collected by the CMS experiment, at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of sNN=8.16 TeV. A significant positive v2 signal from long-range azimuthal correlations is observed for all particle species in high-multiplicity p+Pb collisions. The measurement represents the first observation of possible long-range collectivity for open heavy flavor hadrons in small systems. The results suggest that charm quarks have a smaller v2 than the lighter quarks, probably reflecting a weaker collective behavior. This effect is not seen in the larger PbPb collision system at sNN=5.02 TeV, also presented."
"Development of an emergy computation algorithm for complex systems using depth first search and track summing methods  2018 Elsevier LtdAlthough emergy analysis provides a more comprehensive view of sustainability than other methods, it has been criticized from both theoretical and practical aspects due to its complicated approach, especially when dealing with large sized systems and allocating emergy involved with feedbacks or with input streams that have splits and co-products. The aim of this study was to provide a practical sustainability decision-making software tool to cover all the emergy rules by reformulating and improving previous emergy accounting procedures using the MATLAB language algorithm. The code consisted of the two components of (i) searching the emergy pathways, where the algorithm is adapted from the depth first search method, and (ii) the computation of emergy based on emergy algebra, where the track summing method was deployed. The algorithm was validated on three case studies, comprised of two complex systems with feedbacks, splits and co-products and one case of an industrial symbiosis with a closed loop of materials and energy through reuse and recycle. Three emergy size distribution behaviors (symbiosis, serial and parallel) were revealed and classification of the process behavior could be used to reduce the calculation complexity in further emergy applications."
"Event-B formalization of basic supply chain patterns  2018 IEEE.In recent years, as supply chains are increasingly becoming more valuable and dynamic, a large variety of compliance with high quality is needed for total safety and reliability. Several business process models were proposed to cope with the increasing risk and complexity of the supply chain operations and events, especially when the unexpected events, caused by the time dependent behaviors, occur. Formal verification approach becomes more interesting choice as the preventive checking of the safety and correctness of a real-time system specification from the very beginning of the design phase. In practice, a timed Petri net as a formal model is commonly used to graphically illustrate the time dependent behaviors of a real-time system. However, the simulation of the timed Petri net is tedious and inefficient for verifying the huge and complex realtime system. Alternatively, Event-B formalization approach provides an efficient and better automatic proving tool, whilst the writing Event-B specification from scratch needs the designer with the mathematical logic backgrounds. In this paper, we still encourage the drawing of an ordinary timed Petri net (OTPN) as a formal model of the supply chain events which is easier and more understandable in the first place. Moreover, we expect that several basic supply chain event patterns, as building blocks of ordinary timed Petri net notations, would help ease the construction of the formal model of the complex production processes. We hereafter propose a mean to transform the given ordinary timed Petri net of the supply chain event patterns into a complete Event-B specification which will be automatically proved by an Event-B prover called Rodin."
"Improving short text classification using fast semantic expansion on multichannel convolutional neural network  2018 IEEE.Nowadays, text classification is recognized as one of crucial tools for business users to gain more insights from customers. However, textual data from customers such as comments are usually short. Thus, there are two main issues in short text categorization: (1) insufficient contextual information and (2) noisy data due to misspellings. Recently, there is a prior attempt to propose a deep learning approach for short text categorization by expanding semantic using word embeddings clustering via an algorithm based on density peaks searching. Since the number of words in word embeddings is usually large, the clustering algorithm does not scale with the size of data set, thus demanding unacceptable computational cost. In this paper, we aim to propose a fast short-text categorization framework. Rather than using a CNN with k-max pooling layer, we propose to use a faster version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called 'multichannel CNN.' To speed up the semantic expansion process, we propose to employ mini batch K-Means++, which is considerably faster and scales well with the size of data set. Furthermore, we also introduce an additional preprocessing step to increase vocabulary coverage rate on word embeddings. We conducted experiments on four public data sets: Google Snippets, TREC, MR, and Subj. The results showed that the proposed framework does not only improve an accuracy on all data sets, but also reduces computational costs from several days to a few hours."
"An ontology-based knowledge acquisition for PDM  2018 IEEE.In the present, there are numerous project management software packages used to serve the complex scheduling tasks in a project plan including different groups of people and resources. Most of the tools apply Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) to visualize the activities and their dependencies among various project activities but these tools do not provide semantic representation. Thus, it still requires an implicit knowledge of project managers to analyze and manage scheduling tasks. Ontology could be used to represent the structure of a domain by means of defining concepts and properties that relate them. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for building PDM ontology using OWL and construct SWRL reasoning to infer new knowledge from existing one."
"Formalism of stochastic queueing network using stochastic petri nets  2018 IEEE.Queueing process is an essential behavior of common software systems. It would have critical impact on the requirements, including credibility, accuracy, timeliness and cost. Especially in the real-time system, a queueing network system provides a high level comprehensive model to help analyze and adjust the performance of the availability of incoming customer and service resources. In this paper, we intend to focus on the formalism of stochastic queues and the construction of them into a comprehensive queueing network system, as to cope with the random behaviors of the arrival time and service time. A stochastic Petri net is considered and illustrated to represent the target stochastic queueing network and a simple Markovian graph is generated to represent the probability distribution of the behavioral model."
"Effectiveness of voriconazole and corneal cross-linking on Phialophora verrucosa keratitis: A case report  2018 The Author(s).Background: We report a rare case of Phialophora verrucosa fungal keratitis, which required various types of treatment according to the intractable natural history of the disease. Case presentation: A 51-year-old Thai man with poorly controlled diabetes received a bamboo branch injury and developed a perforated corneal lesion on his left eye. A pathological study from therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty showed fungal hyphae. This was later identified as Phialophora verrucosa by polymerase chain reaction. This organism was aggressive and recalcitrant because it relapsed with two corneal grafts and was resistant to amphotericin B, natamycin, and itraconazole. However, we found that the efficacy of voriconazole was promising for treating Phialophora verrucosa. We also used corneal cross-linking to establish corneal integrity after the infection was under control. Conclusions: Because of the chronic nature of Phialophora verrucosa, a patient's first visit may occur many years after trauma, and sometimes clinical presentation might not appear to indicate fungal infection. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed in this situation. Voriconazole showed good results in our case. Instead of using a more invasive keratoplasty, we used corneal cross-linking to strengthen the corneal biomechanics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case showing the benefit of corneal cross-linking to improve corneal biomechanics in resolved Phialophora verrucosa keratitis."
"Magnifying elements in semigroups of linear transformations with invariant subspaces  2018,  2018 Taru Publications.Let L(V) be the linear transformation semigroup on a vector space V. It is well-known that L(V) contains left [right] magnifying elements if and only if the dimension of V is infinite. In case its dimension is infinite, α ϵ L(V) is left magnifying if and only if it is surjective and not injective and it is right magnifying if and only if it is injective and not surjective. To generalize this result, let W be a subspace of V and S(V, W) = {f ∈ L(V) | (W) f ⊆ W}. Then S(V, W) is a subsemigroup of L(V) and if W = V, then S(V, W) = S(V, V) = L(V). Our purpose in this paper is to give necessary and sufficient conditions for elements in S(V, W) to be left [right] magnifying."

"Gold nanoparticles attenuates bacterial sepsis in cecal ligation and puncture mouse model through the induction of M2 macrophage polarization  2018 The Author(s).Background: Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have several biochemical advantageous properties especially for a candidate of drug carrier. However, the non-conjugated AuNP has a higher rate of cellular uptake than the conjugated ones. Spherical AuNP in a proper size (20-30 nm) is non-toxic to mice and shows anti-inflammatory properties. We tested if the administration of AuNP, as an adjuvant to antibiotics, could attenuate bacterial sepsis in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model with antibiotic (imipenem/cilastatin). Results: Indeed, AuNP administration at the time of CLP improved the survival, blood bacterial burdens, kidney function, liver injury and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-10). AuNP also decreased M1 macrophages (CD86 + ve in F4/80 + ve cells) and increased M2 macrophages (CD206 + ve in F4/80 + ve cells) in the spleens of sepsis mice. The weak antibiotic effect of AuNP was demonstrated as the reduction of E. coli colony after 4 h incubation. In addition, AuNP altered cytokine production of bone-marrow-derived macrophages including reduced TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β but increased IL-10 at 6 and 24 h. Moreover, AuNP induced macrophage polarization toward anti-inflammatory responses (M2) as presented by increased Arg1 (Arginase 1) and PPARγ with decreased Nos2 (inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNos) and Nur77 at 3 h after incubation in vitro. Conclusions: The adjuvant therapy of AuNP, with a proper antibiotic, attenuated CLP-induced bacterial sepsis in mice, at least in part, through the antibiotic effect and the induction of macrophage function toward the anti-inflammatory responses."

More robust evidence is needed to inform innovative and targeted interventions that bridge research gaps, inform policy, and improve outcomes for adolescents. A global research prioritization exercise was undertaken by WHO and CIPHER to focus efforts on priority research in the context of diminishing resources. Methods: The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) methodology was adapted and used. Outcomes were reviewed by an expert group and 5 priority themes identified for testing, treatment, and service delivery, accounting for existing policies, published literature, and ongoing research. Results: A total of 986 research questions were submitted by 323 individuals from 67 countries. For HIV testing, priority themes included strategies and interventions to improve access, uptake, and linkage to care, and self-testing, particularly for key populations. For treatment, priorities included strategies to monitor and improve adherence, novel drug delivery systems, preventions and management of coinfections, optimal drug sequencing, and short- and long-term outcomes. For service delivery, priorities included service delivery models across the cascade, strategies to improve retention in care and sexual and reproductive health, support for pregnant ALHIV, and the provision of psychosocial support. Conclusions: This prioritized research agenda assists in focusing future research in ALHIV and will help to fill critical knowledge gaps. Key stakeholders, donors, program managers, and researchers should all support these priority questions and themes to collaboratively drive the adolescent HIV research agenda forward."
"Significance of H461 at subsite +1 in substrate binding and transglucosylation activity of amylomaltase from Corynebacterium glutamicum  2018 Elsevier Inc.Amylomaltase (AM) catalyzes inter- and intra-molecular transglycosylation reactions of glucan to yield linear and cyclic oligosaccharide products. The functional roles of the conserved histidine at position 461 in the active site of AM from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgAM) was investigated. H461 A/S/D/R/W were constructed, their catalytic properties were compared to the wild-type (WT). A significant decrease in transglucosylation activities was observed, especially in H461A mutant, while hydrolysis activity was barely affected. The transglucosylation factor of the H461A-CgAM was decreased by 8.6 folds. WT preferred maltotriose (G3) as substrate for disproportionation reaction, but all H461 mutants showed higher preference for maltose (G2). Using G3 substrate, kcat/Km values of H461 mutated CgAMs were 40–64 folds lower, while the Km values were twice higher than those of WT. All mutants could not produce large-ring cyclodextrin (LR-CD) product. The heat capacity profile indicated that WT had higher thermal stability than H461A. The X-ray structure of WT showed two H-bonds between H461 and heptasaccharide analog at subsite +1, while no such bonding was observed from the model structure of H461A. The importance of H461 on substrate binding with CgAM was evidenced. We are the first to mutate an active site histidine in AM to explore its function."
"Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, single crystal X-ray analysis and DFT calculation of isomeric Cu(MR)2(β/γ-pic)2 complexes: First transition metal complexes of methyl red  2018 Elsevier B.V.Two transition metal complexes containing copper (II) ion, dye methyl red (H-MR) and nitrogen donor ligands β/γ-picoline (β/γ-pic) have been synthesized for the first time using appropriate starting materials in methanol-water (4:1 v/v) as solvent and characterized by spectroscopic methods (UV–Vis, FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analyses. The crystal structures of both complexes have been unambiguously determined by single crystal X-ray analysis as [Cu(MR)2 (β-pic)2] for 1 and [Cu(MR)2 (γ-pic)2 (MeOH)0.5(H2O)0.5]∙0.5MeOH∙1.5H2O for 2. Whereas in complex 1 Cu(II) coordinated by carboxylate oxygen atoms of two MR and nitrogen atoms of two β-pic molecules adopts an almost ideal square planar geometry, in complex 2 Cu(II) additionally coordinated by methanol/water exhibits a distorted square pyramidal structure. Both complexes are packed in layers stabilized by intermolecular C/O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds. DFT calculations provided insight into the existence of the six possible relevant complexes. The relative stabilities are in the order Cu(MR)2 (γ-pic)2(H2O) 2w ≈ Cu(MR)2 (β-pic)2(H2O) 1w > Cu(MR)2 (γ-pic)2 (MeOH) 2m ≈ Cu(MR)2 (β-pic)2 (MeOH) 1m » Cu(MR)2 (γ-pic)2 2b ≈ Cu(MR)2 (β-pic)2 1, suggesting the significant role of solvent's coordination in enhancing the thermodynamic stability of metal coordination complexes."
"Narrowing band gap energy of defective black TiO2 fabricated by solution plasma process and its photocatalytic activity on glycerol transformation  2018 Elsevier B.V.Defective black titania (TiO2) was synthesized by the solution plasma technique at ambient temperature and pressure. The effects of the electrolyte solution medium type (KCl and HNO3) and concentration (0.3 and 3.0 mM) as well as the plasma discharge time (1–4 h) with a Ti electrode were investigated. The 3.0 mM HNO3 solution provided the highest energy per second discharging into the plasma, resulting in both a high synthesis rate of black TiO2 and a high degree of defective structures, as monitored in terms of the Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio, which can shorten the band gap energy (Eg) of the obtained black TiO2. A long plasma discharge time (4 h) induced the formation of large particles of black TiO2, which appeared as a highly defective structure. Overall, the black TiO2 prepared by discharged plasma for 4 h in 3.0 mM HNO3 solution (BTN-304) provided the highest photocatalytic activity for glycerol conversion (58.49% at 24 h) and 4.85, 3.32, 2.11, 2.15, 39.15 and 26.61% yield of glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, hydroxypyruvic acid, glycolic acid, glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde, respectively. Pathway of glycerol conversion and product distribution over black TiO2 was attempted to propose. Finally, the reusability of the best black TiO2 was explored."
"X-ray absorption spectroscopy investigation of relationship between Mg vacancy and magnetic properties of MgO powder  2018 Elsevier B.V.This paper reports on the ferromagnetism of MgO powder and degraded powder at room temperature. The starting material, Mg(OH)2 was analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry and then calcined at 450 °C for 5 h to obtain fresh MgO powder. The calcined powder was separated into two batches (i) kept in vacuum sealed (MgO-F) and (ii) kept at ambient environment (30–32 °C at 45–55% relative humidity) for 2 days (MgO-D). The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). XRD and EXAFS confirmed that MgO phase in MgO-F. Both Mg(OH)2 and MgO compositions were found in MgO-D. The origin of ferromagnetism at room temperature of MgO-F and MgO-D is attributed to the Mg vacancies in the MgO structure that revealed and verified by XANES and EXAFS results."
"β-Cyclodextrin encapsulation elevates antioxidant capacity of tea: A closing chapter on non-epicatechins, atomistic insights from X-ray analysis, DFT calculation and DPPH assay  2018 Elsevier LtdPolyphenolic catechins prevalent in tea are powerful antioxidants for therapeutics of various free radical-related diseases. The non-epicatechins are thermally obtained from the naturally abundant epicatechins. In our study series on the structure–antioxidant property relationship of the CD inclusion complexes with tea catechins, this closing chapter presents the β-CD encapsulation of three non-epicatechins, i.e., (−)-gallocatechin (GC) 1, (−)-catechin gallate (GC) 2, and (−)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG) 3 investigated by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, DFT calculation and DPPH radical scavenging activity assay. Detailed structural comparisons of the β-CD inclusion complexes with both non-epi and epi type catechins reveal that a common host-guest hydrogen bonding scheme and the shielding of catechin OH groups inside the host circular wall play a prime role in flourishing antioxidant capacities in the order of 3 > 2 > 1. This is consistent with the relative thermodynamic stabilities derived from DFT energy minimization."
"Amphiregulin modifies the Minnesota acute graft-versus-host disease risk score: Results from BMT CTN 0302/0802  2018 by The American Society of Hematology.Amphiregulin (AREG) is an epidermal growth factor receptor ligand that can restore integrity to damaged intestinal mucosa in murine models of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). We previously reported that circulating AREG is elevated in late-onset aGVHD (occurring after 100 days posttransplant), but its clinical relevance in the context of aGVHD risk is unknown. We measured AREG in 251 aGVHD onset blood samples from Blood and Marrow Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) primary treatment trials and determined their association with GVHD severity, day 28 complete or partial response (CR/PR) to first-line therapy, overall survival (OS), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Every doubling of plasma AREG was associated with a 33% decrease in the odds of day 28 CR/PR (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; P, .01). An AREG threshold of 33 pg/mL or greater divided patients with Minnesota standard-risk (SR) aGVHD into a distinct group with a significantly lower likelihood of: day 28 CR/PR (72% vs 85%; P 5 .02); greater 2-year NRM (42% vs 15%; P, .01); and inferior OS (40% vs 66%; P, .01). High AREG $ 33 pg/mL also stratified patients with Minnesota high-risk (HR) aGVHD: day 28 CR/PR (54% vs 83%; P 5 .03) and 2-year NRM (53% vs 11%; P, .01), with a trend toward inferior 2-year OS (37% vs 60%; P 5 .09). High-circulating AREG ($33 pg/mL) reclassifies patients into HR subgroups and thereby further refines the Minnesota aGVHD clinical risk score."
"Effect of calcium precursors on pelletized property and cyclic CO2 capture performance  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.CaO is widely used for capturing CO2 in large scale application however the work on the manufacture of CaO based pellets for the application of CO2 capture is relatively limited. In this research investigated the effect of calcium precursors (Ca(OH)2, Ca(NO3)2 and Ca(CH3COO)2) and their synthesis method (sol-mixing and wet-mixing) on pelletization. Adsorbent synthesized from Ca(CH3COO)2 as a precursor using sol-mixing pelletize to porous spherical provide the best mechanical strength and CO2 adsorption capacity 0.51 and 0.41 g CO2/ g CaO at first cycle and tenth cycle respectively. The outstanding cyclic performance of Ca(CH3COO)2 sol-mixing can be ascribed to the presence of inert support material i.e. Ca9Al6O18 and Ca12Al14O33 with suitable pore volume to prevent sintering of CaO and structure collapsing at high temperature."
"Detection of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in groundwater with low arsenic concentration in Rayong province, Thailand  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.As contamination in groundwater has become one of the global problems. It has been reported that million people around the world get adverse effects on their health by direct and indirect As-contaminated groundwater consumption. In groundwater, the most abundant As species are arsenite (As3+) and arsenate (As5+). Arsenite is more toxic and mobile than arsenate. Consequently, arsenite oxidation is considered as an important process in groundwater As bioremediation. It has been reported that arsenite-oxidizing bacteria play an important role in reducing As toxicity in contaminated groundwater environment. A functional gene involved in arsenite oxidation is aioA gene. The key objective of this study was to investigate the arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in groundwater with low arsenic concentration in Rayong province, Thailand. The results showed that the arsenite-oxidizing bacteria were detected in groundwater with low arsenic concentration. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were closely related to Rhizobium sp., Bradyrhizobiaceae sp., Hydrogenophaga sp., and Stenotrophomonas sp. The knowledge gained from this study will help better understand the distribution of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria in groundwater with low As concentration."
"Designing number of Kanban in glove box assembly  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.For many decades, Just-In-Time manufacturing and lean manufacturing have adopted kanban system as a mean to control inventory and production. A number of tagged kanban cards represents inventory of the system, whereas untagged kanban cards equate to production orders. The ideal conditions are a consistent product mixed with a small production lot size and minimum setup time. Such conditions are difficult to obtain even in many automotive assembly lines similar to a case study. The case study assembly line is a glove box assembly production line that assembles two plastic parts and wields them together with a vibration machine after positioning in a mold designed for different products. Because of storage equipment, each kanban card represents 60 identical glove boxes. Therefore, a production engineer re-schedules the production planning to minimize the numbers of changeover without any effect on downstream. This ad hoc production scheduling leads to urgent production orders and interruption of lot size. As a result, the factory embeds historical data into a computer simulation that accounts for current molds, receiving time, and numbers of pending kanban cards, as well as number of storage equipment. The results of this simulation reveals that scheduling criteria and suggest a suitable lot size if the factory decides to change a storage equipment."
"Synthesis of glycerol carbonate from dimethyl carbonate and glycerol using CaO derived from eggshells  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.Waste eggshell is proposed as a highly active catalyst for glycerol carbonate production from dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and glycerol. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst loading on the reaction performance were investigated in order to find a suitable operating condition. CaO derived from waste eggshell exhibits catalytic activity comparable to commercial CaO. By using CaO eggshell, glycerol conversion of 96% can be achieved within 90 min of reaction time under 2.5:1 feed molar ratio of DMC to glycerol, 0.08 mole ratio of CaO to glycerol and reaction temperature of 60°C. The catalyst was examined by XRD, TGA/DSC, SEM, N2 adsorption-desorption and Hammett indicators method. Utilization of eggshell as a catalyst for glycerol carbonate production not only provides a cost-effective and value-added of waste eggshell as a green catalyst, but also decrease amount of waste and its treatment cost which is ecologically friendly."
"The effect of ethoxylate nonionic surfactants on phase inversion temperature and salinity: An alternative approach for vegetable oil recovery from spent bleaching earth  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.An accurate determination of the hydrophilic-lipophilic nature of surfactants plays an important role in guiding microemulsion formation. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of ethoxylate numbers (EONs) (3, 5, and 7 moles) of nonionic surfactants on a phase inversion temperature (PIT) and optimum salinity based on the equivalent alkane carbon numbers (ACNs) of vegetable oils. Three vegetable oils, soybean oil, crude rice bran oil and crude palm oil, were selected for use as a surrogate oil to represent the residual oils found in spent bleaching earth. In this study, the hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation (HLD) was used to predict the optimum salinity (0-20 %wt.) at various temperatures (25-55°C). The results showed that the ACNs of crude rice bran oil, crude palm oil, and soybean oil were 15.41±0.35, 13.71±0.41, and 17.60±0.28, respectively. In comparison, these predictions with the experimental results, the data showed slight deviations in the optimum salinity with the specific temperature. Finally, the ACN and the surfactant characteristics obtained in this study were combined with the HLD equation and used to validate its practically and utility for guiding the optimum microemulsion formulation."
"Re-evaluation of pediatric 18F-FDG dosimetry: Cristy-Eckerman versus UF/NCI hybrid computational phantoms  2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.Because of the concerns associated with radiation exposure at a young age, there is an increased interest in pediatric absorbed dose estimates for imaging agents. Almost all reported pediatric absorbed dose estimates, however, have been determined using adult pharmacokinetic data with radionuclide S values that take into account the anatomical differences between adults and children based upon the older Cristy-Eckerman (C-E) stylized phantoms. In this work, we use pediatric model-derived pharmacokinetics to compare absorbed dose and effective dose estimates for 18F-FDG in pediatric patients using S values generated from two different geometries of computational phantoms. Time-integrated activity coefficients of 18F-FDG in brain, lungs, heart wall, kidneys and liver, retrospectively, calculated from 35 pediatric patients at the Boston's Children Hospital were used. The absorbed dose calculation was performed in accordance with the Medical Internal Radiation Dose method using S values generated from the University of Florida/National Cancer Institute (UF/NCI) hybrid phantoms, as well as those from C-E stylized computational phantoms. The effective dose was computed using tissue-weighting factors from ICRP Publication 60 and ICRP Publication 103 for the C-E and UF/NCI, respectively. Substantial differences in the absorbed dose estimates between UF/NCI hybrid pediatric phantoms and the C-E stylized phantoms were found for the lungs, ovaries, red bone marrow and urinary bladder wall. Large discrepancies in the calculated dose values were observed in the bone marrow; ranging between -26% to +199%. The effective doses computed by the UF/NCI hybrid phantom S values were slightly different than those seen using the C-E stylized phantoms with percent differences of -0.7%, 2.9% and 2.5% for a newborn, 1 year old and 5 year old, respectively. Differences in anatomical modeling features among computational phantoms used to perform Monte Carlo-based photon and electron transport simulations for 18F, and very likely for other radionuclides, impact internal organ dosimetry computations for pediatric nuclear medicine studies."
"Risk-based N-2 contingency ranking in transmission system using operational condition  2018 IEEE.Power system security assessment for operational application requires more various methods than only considering the impact of contingency as traditional. Moreover, the growth of transmission grid may increase risk of multiple outage contingencies occurred, especially in double contingency case. In this paper, contingency screening and risk-based contingency ranking are proposed to assess and rank N-2 contingencies by using both of the consequence of overloading on transmission lines and the probability of occurrence that integrated with operational condition. The simulation results on the Central area of Thailand 139-bus test system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed module."
"Feature reduction on fuzzy SVM-based coding unit decision in HEVC  2018 IEEE.This paper proposes a feature reduction approach on a fuzzy SVM-based Coding Unit (CU) size decision method in a recent video encoding standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). The proposed feature reduction approach with Rate Control (RC) can reduce computational complexity by eliminating some correlated features of a fuzzy SVM-based CU size decision method under a similar coding efficiency. According to the empirical results, our approach can achieve up to 3% of Time Saving (TS) under the same RD performance over a fuzzy SVM-based approach."
"Classification models for stock's performance prediction: A case study of finance sector in the stock exchange of Thailand  2018 IEEE.Within stock market, the objective of both stock buyers and sellers is to make profit on price difference based on their expectation on a company's current and future value. There is no investing strategy that is considered to be the best by experts, and investing decision criteria remain contingent upon an individual investor's experiences and bias. To address the challenges, this paper uses financial ratios and company's industry data of stocks in finance sector of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) to construct two classification models predicting (i) whether stock's one-year return will outperform the SET Index and (ii) whether the return will be positive. Various classification techniques, including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are explored, whose performances are evaluated by Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Based on the AUC values, we can conclude that, on average, all methods are comparatively good, with LR and LDA being the most useful classifiers for risk averse investors- A s both are not subject to uncertainty due to true positive counting bias."
"China Studies In South And Southeast Asia: Between Pro-china And Objectivism  2019 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved.The rise of China has reconstituted the regional identity in Asia as well as the lens through which understanding of China and self-understanding are no longer separate processes intellectually. China scholarship in South and Southeast Asia necessarily highlights meanings of encountering China that Western social sciences fail to reflect because academics in many places, being migrants, navigate and combine more than one civilization forces. With China in itself undergoing transformation, it is unlikely that one can simply speak of China without multiple qualifications of what one actually refers to. The book gathers authors who come from different scholarly traditions to reflect upon how the presentation of China in academic writings as well as think tank analyses can engender different identity possibilities. The book therefore complicates the category ""China"" to enable mutual empathy between everything that in one way or another relies on Chineseness as object or subject in accordance with the identity strategies of the China experts."
"Design and Optimisation of a Power Efficient High-Altitude Platform for Equatorial Operation  2018 IEEE.High-altitude Platform (HAP) is an aircraft cruising in stratosphere for surveillance and telecommunication. There are three main types of HAPs: a fixed wing aeroplane, an airship, and a balloon. This study aims at designing an unmanned solar-powered aeroplane for communication, functioning as a satellite. The values of solar radiation power on the equinox, summer solstice and winter solstice were estimated as well as a required power from each mission profile. Those values of the required power and the available one were used as constraints for a required solar cell area and a required battery capacity. Then, the wing planform was sized. To optimise the wing, three aerofoils with different tip dihedral angles were simulated with ANSYS so that the one with the optimal rolling, pitching and yawing moments could be selected. The mass of each aircraft component was later estimated, tail was sized based on those masses and their locations. The static margin was calculated to validate the tail sizing with the HAP centre of mass. The verification of power consumption was also performed by a simulation of the whole aircraft. The final conceptual HAP model is equipped with 19.5-aspect-ratio Eppler 397 wing with an angle of incidence of 5 degrees and tip dihedral angle of 8 degree at 7.5 metres from the longitudinal centre line."
"Taxes and risk-taking behavior: evidence from mergers and acquisitions in the G7 nations  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: This study aims to examine how corporate taxes affect corporate risk-taking decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines corporate risk-taking by analyzing how a firm’s asset risk changes following an acquisition carried out by publicly listed companies in the G7 nations. To measure the asset risk of a firm, this study uses the option pricing framework in Merton (1974). Findings: Consistent with an implication of the Merton (1974) framework, the findings show that firms take more risk in their investment decisions when tax rates are high. Moreover, the tax effects wane for firms with a relatively large borrowing opportunity and this suggests that the risk-taking incentive from taxes is moderated by the reputation concern in the debt market, lending support to the Diamond (1989) reputation-building model. The empirical results also show that the tax-induced risk-taking incentive is restrained by creditor rights. Overall, the study reveals an important role of taxes in the structure of corporate investment decisions. Practical implications: The implications of this study can be beneficial to policymakers when considering the alteration of tax rates, as it will affect the riskiness of firm investment decisions. Originality/value: This study provides a better understanding of the role of taxes on risk-taking and also contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting tax effects of risk-taking. The relationship between taxes and risk-taking has proven that the corporate taxation is one of the key factors that firms consider during their selection of risky investments. Unlike previous studies, this research is the first to investigate the change in asset risk, estimating by the option pricing framework, through studying a particular event: mergers and acquisitions."
"Search for R-parity violating supersymmetry in pp collisions at s=13TeV using b jets in a final state with a single lepton, many jets, and high sum of large-radius jet masses  2018 The Author(s)Results are reported from a search for physics beyond the standard model in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s=13TeV. The search uses a signature of a single lepton, large jet and bottom quark jet multiplicities, and high sum of large-radius jet masses, without any requirement on the missing transverse momentum in an event. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. No significant excess beyond the prediction from standard model processes is observed. The results are interpreted in terms of upper limits on the production cross section for R-parity violating supersymmetric extensions of the standard model using a benchmark model of gluino pair production, in which each gluino decays promptly via g˜→tbs. Gluinos with a mass below 1610 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level."
"Inhibitory Activities of Protein Hydrolysates from Spotted Babylon Snails on Tyrosinase and Melanogenesis  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis.The optimal conditions for protein hydrolysates preparation from spotted babylon Babylonia areolata exhibiting tyrosinase inhibitory activity and antioxidant activity using alkaline protease (Protease G6) were undiluted Protease G6 (5.8 × 105 DU/g) at 60 min of hydrolysis time and eightfold diluted Protease G6 (7.25 × 104 DU/g) at 240 min of hydrolysis time. These two conditions were fractioned using molecular weight (MW) cutoff values of 10, 5, and 3 kDa membranes, and their anti-melanogenic and antioxidant properties were further analyzed. Among the fractions, the MW < 3 kDa fraction exhibited high levels of inhibitory activity toward the mono- and diphenolase activities of tyrosinase, with IC50 values of 1.758 and 8.995 μg/mL, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that this fraction behaved as an uncompetitive inhibitor. The results demonstrated that the MW < 3 kDa fraction suppressed melanin synthesis and decreased cellular tyrosinase activity with no cytotoxicity to B16F10 melanoma cells."
"Experimental study of dual fixed bed biochar-catalytic gasification with simultaneous feed of O2-steam-CO2 for synthesis gas or hydrogen production  2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCThe catalytic gasification of biochar was investigated in the presence of a Ni/SiO2 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor with an O2-steam-CO2 gas feed. The effects of operating temperature, catalyst nickel loading and composition of O2-steam-CO2 feed gas on biochar carbon conversion and gas products were investigated. The results indicate that the highest biochar carbon conversion could be obtained at approximately 800 °C, whilst the 10% Ni/SiO2 catalyst was shown to produce the greatest syngas yields. The presence of O2 in the feed gas can result in slightly more CO in the gas product, whilst a higher steam content leads to more H2 in the gas product. The CO2 offered a benefit as an adjusting agent for achieving a desired H2/CO ratio. No evidence of coke deposition on the catalyst was found under any of the tested conditions."
"Balancing relapses versus cognitive impairment in primary central nervous system lymphoma: a single-center experience  2017,  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Objectives: The outcomes of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) are much improved with multi-modality regimens. Unfortunately, in limited-resource countries, chemo-radiotherapy is the only option of curative-intent treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of low-dose whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) as a consolidation on disease control and long-term neurocognitive functions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single-center study enrolling PCNSL patients from 2011 to May 2016 to evaluate the real-life treatment outcome and neurotoxicity from treatment especially radiotherapy. Results: Thirty-seven newly diagnosed immunocompetent PCNSL patients were treated with a high-dose methotrexate-based regimen with or without WBRT. The median age was 56 (range 16–78) years old. After chemotherapy, the overall response and complete response (CR) rates were 59.5% and 43.2%, respectively. All 6 partial response (PR) patients and 6 of 16 CR patients underwent radiotherapy. In 22 patients who achieved CR, the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients without WBRT was significantly inferior to the WBRT group with the hazard ratio of 4.7 (95% confidence interval 1.14–19.82, p = 0.03). The 3-year PFS were 35% and 78.75%, respectively, but there was no difference in overall survival. The serial Montreal Cognitive Assessment evaluations (20–72 months post chemotherapy) of 10 long-term CR patients revealed one dementia among three patients without WBRT and five mild cognitive impairments in seven patients with WBRT. Except for the dementia case, all the other patients can perform daily activities without assistance. Conclusion: The low-dose WBRT consolidation is associated with lower PCNSL relapses with only mild neurocognitive toxicity."
"Green transportation system to promote sustainable lifestyle in Chulalongkorn University  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.Chulalongkorn University (CU) is located at the heart of Bangkok, which is one of the most traffic congested cities in the world. It is very crucial for the university to develop a green and clean transportation system that is good for both the CU community and the whole society. To reduce on-campus traffic, the university provides four parking buildings on the edge of four corners of the campus to serve visitors, students, faculties and staffs who travel by private cars. While providing added convenience, these parking garages reduce traffic congestion on campus and, thus, pollutions from harmful emissions and traffic noises. To promote eco-friendly transportation in the campus, the university provides ""CU Shuttle Bus"" - an electric shuttle bus service that cover not only campus area, but also reach out to public sky train and subway stations around the campus. The CU Shuttle Bus's mobile application, developed by engineering students, helps improve user experience by showing all useful information including campus map, bus routing, and real-time locations of all buses. To encourage walking and cycling within the campus and to promote good health and fitness, the university has been constructing covered walkways and bike lanes throughout the campus. In addition, ""CU Bike"" - a bike sharing program, was first introduced in 2014 and has quickly grown in popularity among CU students since. A new ""CU Toyota Hamo"", an electric vehicle rental program, is another great option of green transportations for those who cannot ride a bicycle and for older people of the aging society. All these projects help promote the development of innovations and practices that are both sustainable and protective of the environment of Chulalongkorn University, as well as the surrounding community, the country and planet as a whole."

Funded by SCOAP3.The pseudorapidity distributions of dijets as functions of their average transverse momentum (pTave) are measured in proton-lead (pPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions. The data samples were collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. A significant modification of the pPb spectra with respect to the pp spectra is observed in all pTave intervals investigated. The ratios of the pPb and pp distributions are compared to next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations with unbound nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs). These results give the first evidence that the gluon PDF at large Bjorken x in lead ions is strongly suppressed with respect to the PDF in unbound nucleons."
"TRH site-specific methylation in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma  2018 The Author(s).Background: The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) continues to increase each year. Clinical examination and biopsy usually detect OSCC at an advanced stage that is difficult to treat, leading to poor prognosis. DNA methylation pattern is tissue specific and has emerged as a biomarker for the detection of cancers of tissue origin. Herein, we aimed to discover a novel site-specific methylation marker for OSCC. Methods: We selected OSCC datasets analyzed using the IlluminaHumanMethylation27 BeadChip from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information using a bioinformatics approach. From 27,578 CG dinucleotide (CpG) sites, the CpG site with the highest difference in methylation level between healthy and cancerous cells was selected for further validation. A total of 18 mucosal tissue samples were collected from nine healthy controls and nine from OSCC subjects and subjected to microdissection for cell purification, followed by DNA extraction, bisulfite conversion, and pyrosequencing. Additionally, epithelial cells were collected from 2 cohorts including oral rinse from healthy controls, oral rinse and oral swab from OSCC subjects and oral rinse from oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were examined for their methylation status using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Among the 27,578 differentially methylated CpG sites, cg01009664 of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) gene showed the greatest difference in methylation level between healthy and cancerous cells. Validation of the TRH gene using pyrosequencing revealed a methylation percentage of 7% ± 3.43% in healthy cells in contrast to 63% ± 19.81% in cancerous cells. Screening of epithelial cells using real-time PCR showed that the DNA methylation level was significantly higher in oral swab and rinse samples collected from OSCC and oropharyngeal SCC subjects than those from healthy controls (p < 0.001). In addition, when using a cutoff at 3.31 ng/μL, the TRH methylation biomarker was able to distinguish OSCC and oropharyngeal SCC subjects from healthy controls with high level of area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: We demonstrated cg01009664 of TRH as a potential biomarker for OSCC and oropharyngeal SCC screening using oral rinse and swab techniques."
"Lowercase Letters in Text-Based CAPTCHA: A Visual Perception Analysis  2018 IEEE.CAPTCHA needs a string of letters to verify if a user is human. Each letter has distinctive visual features, making it perceivably different. No empirical work has yet examined which letters included in text-based CAPTCHA would have high correct response rates from users. The current study hopes to fill this gap. A user test on 6,389 iterations of the lowercase letters used in 1,844 CAPTCHA tests confirmed (1) users' correct response rates to the letters with the short feature had higher correct response rates than those without this feature, and (2) neither the ascending nor the descending feature had impact on the correct response rate. In addition to the theoretical insight into the use of letter perception literature in text-based CAPTCHA design, the findings do have implications for security practitioners."
"High performance of photosynthesis and osmotic adjustment are associated with salt tolerance ability in rice carrying drought tolerance QTL: Physiological and co-expression network analysis  2018 Nounjan, Chansongkrow, Charoensawan, Siangliw, Toojinda, Chadchawan and Theerakulpisut.Understanding specific biological processes involving in salt tolerance mechanisms is important for improving traits conferring tolerance to salinity, one of the most important abiotic stresses in plants. Under drought and salinity stresses, plants share overlapping responsive mechanisms such as physiological changes and activation of signaling molecules, which induce and transmit signals through regulator genes in a regulatory network. In this study, two near isogenic lines of rice carrying chromosome segments of drought tolerance QTL on chromosome 8 fromIR68586-F2-CA-31 (DH103) in the genetic background of sensitive cultivar “Khao Dawk Mali 105; KDML105” (designated as CSSL8-94 and CSSL8-95) were used to investigate physiological responses to salt stress [namely growth, Na+ /K+ ratio, water status, osmotic adjustment, photosynthetic parameters, electrolyte leakage (EL), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline and sugar accumulations], compared with the standard salt tolerant (Pokkali; PK) and their recurrent parent (KDML105) rice cultivars. Physiological examination indicated that both CSSLs showed superior salt-tolerant level to KDML105. Our results suggested that salt tolerance ability of these CSSL lines may be resulted from high performance photosynthesis, better osmotic adjustment, and less oxidative stress damage under salt conditions. Moreover, to explore new candidate genes that might take part in salt tolerance mechanisms, we performed co-expression network analysis for genes identified in the CSSL rice, and found that Os08g419090, the gene involved with tetrapyrrole and porphyrin biosynthetic process (chlorophyll biosynthetic process), Os08g43230 and Os08g43440 (encoded TraB family protein and cytochrome P450, respectively) might have unprecedented roles in salt stress tolerance."
"Influence of silica sources on structural property and activity of Pd-supported on mesoporous MCM-41 synthesized with an aid of microwave heating for partial hydrogenation of soybean methyl esters  2018 Elsevier B.V.MCM-41 has been hydrothermally synthesized using fumed silica (SiO2) and silatrane [Si(TEA)2] as silica sources. Pd nanoparticles were successfully impregnated to the mesoporous MCM-41 supports. Soybean oil methyl ester was partially hydrogenated by the Pd/MCM-41-SiO2 and Pd/MCM-41-silatrane catalysts under a mild condition (low temperature and pressure). Both catalysts could rapidly and selectively convert the polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (C18:3 and C18:2) to monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (C18:1) at 100 °C and 0.4 MPa H2 within 4 h. The results verified that the Pd/MCM-41-silatrane catalyst with the greater surface of Pd active sites had higher catalytic activity, representing in term of turnover frequency (TOF), in partial hydrogenation than Pd/MCM-41-SiO2 under both C18:2 conversions of 40% and 60%. Even if the lower selectivity toward cis-C18:1 was obtained for the former. In addition to the better stable structure of MCM-41-silatrane support as compared to MCM-41-SiO2 support, silatrane precursor is more favorable to diminish the extent of complete hydrogenation than fumed silica as it provided the lower index. Even though, this silica precursor sues for more synthetic step. Due to the higher oxidative stability of Pd/MCM-41-SiO2, MCM-41-SiO2 support was further studied for the later research. When varying the Pd loadings in 0.5–2 wt.% on MCM-41-SiO2 support, the Pd(2)/MCM-41-SiO2 catalyst gave the highest performance (TOF) whether the complete hydrogenation was concurrently accompanied. Results signify that the nature of the silica source and the Pd concentration modified the surface active sites and size distribution of metallic particles, which determine the catalytic reactivity and selectivity."
"Effect of pH on fluorescence quenching of organic dyes by graphene oxide  2018 Elsevier B.V.Graphene oxide (GO) has been recently used in several fluorescence sensing systems as a fluorescence quencher. The interactions between GO sheet and fluorophore directly affect the fluorescence quenching efficiency of GO. To understand these interactions, methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB) and sulforhodamine B (SRhB) were used as model fluorophores at various pH values in aqueous buffer solutions. The synthesized GO was characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, zeta potential measurement and particle size measurement. The interactions between GO and dyes were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence quenching efficiency of GO to each dye is differently affected by the pH attributed to electrostatic interaction, π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding. While electrostatic interaction is the most important interaction for GO–MB and GO–RhB, the π–π stacking also plays an important role for GO–SRhB system. The temperature dependence of the quenching efficiency suggests a static quenching mechanism and the decrease of the quenching efficiency with the reducing GO size is probably due to a lower number of sp2 domains in the GO sheets."
"Investigation of Ni/SiO2 fiber catalysts prepared by different methods on hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Ni/SiO2 (Ni/SF) catalysts were prepared by electrospinning of the SF followed by impregnation. The performance of the Ni/SF catalysts for hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming at various conditions was investigated in comparison with a conventional Ni/silica porous (Ni/SP) catalyst. The influence of the Ni/SF catalyst preparation methods on the catalytic activity and stability in ethanol steam reforming was also studied. The catalysts were prepared by three different preparation techniques: impregnation (IM), deposition precipitation (DP) and strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA). The Ni/SF catalyst exhibited higher performances and stability than the Ni/SP catalyst. The H2 yields of 55% and 47% were achieved at 600°C using the Ni/SF and Ni/SP catalysts, respectively. The preparation methods had a significant effect on the catalytic activity and stability of the Ni/SF catalyst, where that prepared by the SEA method had a smaller Ni particle size and higher dispersion, and also exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability compared to the Ni/SF catalysts prepared by IM and DP methods. The maximum H2 yield produced from the catalyst prepared by SEA was 65%, while that from the catalysts prepared by DP and IM were 60% and 55%, respectively, under the same conditions. The activity of the fiber catalysts prepared by SEA, DP and IM remained almost constant at all times during a 16 h stability test."

"Prevalence and predictors of tobacco use among bhutanese adolescents  Sonam Rinchen, Surasak Taneepanichskul and Namgay Dawa.Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the prevalence of tobacco use and associated factors influencing the use of tobacco among adolescents in a school setting. Design/methodology/approach – A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted amongst Bhutanese adolescents studying at high schools in the district of Wangdue Phodrang in May 2016. A total of 378 eighth-grade students from four schools participated in the study. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to describe the predictors of tobacco use. Findings – Of the 378 student participants, 52.90 percent were girls and 47.10 percent boys. The age ranged from 11 to 19 years, and the majority lived in school hostels (82 percent). The prevalence of smoking was 10.80 percent while smokeless tobacco users constituted 11.10 percent in the month preceding the study. Gender, tobacco use by siblings and friends, ever having tried alcohol, consumption of alcohol in the last 30 days, previous experimentation with cigarettes/bidi and smokeless tobacco/baba (p-value < 0.05) were significantly related to the use of tobacco among students. In multivariate analysis, tobacco use by friends (AdjOR ¼ 1.09; 95%CI ¼ 0.01–2.48), ever having tried alcohol (AdjOR ¼ 2.24; 95%CI ¼ 1.75–3.72), current alcohol use (AdjOR ¼ 2.63; 95%CI ¼ 1.52–4.31), experimentation with cigarettes/bidi (AdjOR ¼ 39.46; 95% CI ¼ 11.91–90.63) or with smokeless tobacco/baba (AdjOR ¼ 32.61; 95%CI ¼ 11.78–90.30) were observed as the strong predictors of current tobacco use among adolescents. Originality/value – These study results re-emphasized the rising public health concern of tobacco use among younger boys and girls. The findings may help the Bhutanese policy makers and managers to better understand the present situation of adolescent tobacco use and its associated determinants, and formulate appropriate tobacco control strategies for adolescents."
"Universal health coverage (UHC)  Samlee Plianbangchang.Purpose – The WHO Health for All goal of the year 2000 was unreachable due to a number of irreconcilable factors. However, governments agree that a resolution must be found to effectively cope with increasing health care costs. Furthermore, national health insurance schemes must be properly refined to suit local situations. Workable health policies and strategies for caring and treating sick people through reduced or cost effective methods must be developed as part of a Universal Health Coverage scheme.

Design/methodology/approach – The effectiveness of the educational program was tested by a quasi-experimental study with a pre-and post-test design. The study was conducted between September and October 2017. Multistage sampling was used to recruit 73 Thai female university students, including 36 students in the intervention group and 37 students in the comparison group. The intervention group received an eight-week educational program, while the comparison group did not. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the improvement of knowledge, attitudes and intention regarding condom and emergency contraceptive pill use. Descriptive statistics, paired samples t-test, Wilcoxon test and Mann–Whitney tests were used for data analysis. Findings – Most participants in both groups had sexual intercourse. After the end of the program, the before-after mean score of the intervention group’s knowledge (8.0, 11.0), attitudes (29.4, 32.4) and intention (17.4, 20.4) were significantly increased (p-value < 0.001). Post-intervention, there were statistically significant differences in knowledge scores (p-value < 0.001) and intention scores (p-value ¼ 0.04) between the intervention group and the comparison group. Originality/value – This educational program increases knowledge and intention but does not influence attitudes toward using condoms and emergency contraceptive pills."
"Efficient all-and-one support vector machines based on one-versus-all data inseparability  2018 IEEE.We introduce a new strategy to estimate data inseparabilities between pairs of classes based on One-Versus-All (OVA) classifiers, and use them to enhance the All-And-One (A&O) technique. For an N-class problem, in the worst case the proposed method requires only N +1 binary classifiers to obtain the classification result as same as in the traditional framework. Our proposed method will properly create the necessary set of One-Versus-One (OVO) classifiers corresponding to OVA data inseparabilities in advance. On the other hand, it will not needlessly construct an OVO classifier if the data separability between that pair of classes is good enough. This is more practical than the traditional A&O technique that suggests to train OVO classifiers on-demand which consumes time while the system is in use. Especially in same cases of real-time applications, it may be very important to keep high speed response and maintain highly accurate results. Experimental results show that the proposed technique gives significantly better performance compared to the OVA and the traditional A&O techniques, while providing comparable accuracy compared to the OVO method. Moreover, a required number of binary classifiers in our proposed method is considerably smaller than in the OVO approach as similar as in the OVA and the traditional A&O techniques."
"Comparison of EEG measurement of upper limb movement in motor imagery training system  2018 The Author(s).Background: One of the most promising applications for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface is for stroke rehabilitation. Implemented as a standalone motor imagery (MI) training system or as part of a rehabilitation robotic system, many studies have shown benefits of using them to restore motor control in stroke patients. Hand movements have widely been chosen as MI tasks. Although potentially more challenging to analyze, wrist and forearm movement such as wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination should also be considered for MI tasks, because these movements are part of the main exercises given to patients in conventional stroke rehabilitation. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of such movements for MI tasks. Methods: Three hand and wrist movement tasks which were hand opening/closing, wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination were chosen as motor imagery tasks for both hands. Eleven subjects participated in the experiment. All of them completed hand opening/closing task session. Ten subjects completed two MI task sessions which were hand opening/closing and wrist flexion/extension. Five subjects completed all three MI tasks sessions. Each MI task comprised 8 sessions spanning a 4weeks period. For classification, feature extraction based on common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used. Two types were implemented, one with conventional CSP (termed WB) and one with an increase number of features achieved by filtering EEG data into five bands (termed FB). Classification was done by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Results: Eight-fold cross validation was applied on EEG data. LDA and SVM gave comparable classification accuracy. FB achieved significantly higher classification accuracy compared to WB. The accuracy of classifying wrist flexion/extension task were higher than that of classifying hand opening/closing task in all subjects. Classifying forearm pronation/supination task achieved higher accuracy than classifying hand opening/closing task in most subjects but achieved lower accuracy than classifying wrist flexion/extension task in all subjects. Significant improvements of classification accuracy were found in nine subjects when considering individual sessions of experiments of all MI tasks. The results of classifying hand opening/closing task and wrist flexion/extension task were comparable to the results of classifying hand opening/closing task and forearm pronation/supination task. Classification accuracy of wrist flexion/extension task and forearm pronation/supination task was lower than those of hand movement tasks and wrist movement tasks. Conclusion: High classification accuracy of the three MI tasks support the possibility of using EEG-based stroke rehabilitation system with these movements. Either LDA or SVM can equally be chosen as a classifier since the difference of their accuracies is not statistically significant. Significantly higher classification accuracy made FB more suitable for classifying MI task compared to WB. More training sessions could potentially lead to better accuracy as evident in most subjects in this experiment."
"Real-Time Rollover Warning in Tripped and Un-tripped Rollovers with A Neural Network  2018 IEEE.Nearly 35% of passenger vehicle accident deaths are from rollover crashes. In vehicle stability control system, the active rollover prevention is presented to prevent rollovers. An imminent rollover should be detected immediately through accurate and reliable detection for active vehicle rollover prevention. A traditional rollover index is able to detect un-tripped rollovers. However, it fails to detect tripped rollovers from external inputs such as tripping by the force of a vehicle striking a curb or a road bump. Thus, a new neural network algorithm to detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers is needed so any estimation algorithms to determine unknown parameters will no longer be used. The neural network algorithm uses multi-variables from available sensors on the vehicle to calculate and categorize the rollover warning into 3 levels: 'Safe', 'Low Risk', and 'High Risk'. Moreover, the algorithm can detect both tripped and un-tripped rollover by testing with a 1/5th scaled vehicle. In order to show dynamic similarity between the 1/5th scale vehicle and a full-sized vehicle, the Buckingham π theorem is used. From experiment results, it is clear that the neural network algorithm can be used to accurately enable the rollover warning for the tripped and un-tripped rollover."
"A Global Research Agenda for Pediatric HIV Copyright  2018 The Author(s).Background: Despite progress, 2016 still saw 160,000 new infections and 120,000 AIDS-related deaths among children. Evidence gaps on how to best diagnose, treat, and deliver services to children living with HIV remain. A global research prioritization exercise was undertaken by WHO and CIPHER to focus research efforts in the context of diminishing resources. Methods: The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology was adapted and used, as described by Irvine et al.1 Outcomes were reviewed by an expert group and 5 priority themes identified for testing, antiretroviral treatment, and service delivery, accounting for existing policies, published literature and ongoing research. Results: A total of 749 questions were submitted by 269 individuals from 62 countries. For HIV testing, priority themes included strategies and interventions to improve access, uptake and linkage to care, including with novel diagnostic tools and entry points beyond antenatal care. For treatment, priorities included strategies to improve adherence, short- and long-term outcomes and management of coinfections, optimal drug formulations, and early ART. For service delivery, priorities included strategies or interventions to improve access, uptake and retention in care, including psychosocial and family support and approaches to HIV disclosure and reduction of stigma and discrimination. Conclusions: This is the largest Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative exercise undertaken in HIV. The results provide guidance to focus future research in pediatric HIV for impact. Global commitment to support priority research, adequate investment, and strong leadership is urgently needed to improve the health and well-being of children living with and affected by HIV."
"Exponential bounds via Stein's method and exchangeable pairs  2018 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage. All rights reserved..We apply Stein's method to obtain a non-uniform exponential bound for normal approximations for certain types of random variables. In particular, we establish the bound for a random variable such that its exchangeable pair coupling exists and the distance between the pair is bounded. Using our result, we obtain better bounds for a wide range of applications, such as sums of bounded independent random variables, the combinatorial central limit theorem, and the numbers of descents and inversions of a permutation."
"CU-MAC: A duty-cycle MAC protocol for internet of things in wireless sensor networks  2018, ECTI Association. All rights reserved.Nowadays ""Internet of Things"" or IoT becomes the most popular technology in the Internet system. Types of devices and sensors have been connected as a network of devices and sensors. While a wireless sensor network is a traditional network of sensors that can be considered as a beginning point of IoT systems. Currently, these sensor data are not only exchanged within a local network but also are delivered to other devices in the Internet. Consequently, well-known organizations such as IEEE, IETF, ITU-T and ISO/IET are trying to set standards for wireless sensor devices in IoT systems. The recommended standard utilizes many of internet stack standards such as CoAP, UDP and IP. However, the traditional design of WSNs is to avoid using internet protocol in the system to reduce transmission overhead and power consumption due to resource limitation. Fortunately, the current technology in both hardware and software allow the internet standard to sufficiently operate in a small sensor. In this paper, we propose a MAC protocol named CU-MAC to efficiently support IoT standard that need request-respond communication or bi-direction communication. CU-MAC uses multi-channel communication to perform continuous and bidirectional data transfer at low duty-cycle. It also has a mechanism to overcome the hidden terminal problem. We evaluated the performance of CU-MAC on both simulation and real testbed based on Contiki OS. The result shows that CU-MAC outperforms other existing MAC protocols in term of packet delivery ratio at 98.7% and requires lower duty-cycle than others to operate in the high traffic environment."
"Molecular aggregation of four modified xyloglucan models in aqueous solution  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.Tamarind seed xyloglucan (TSX) is extracted from tamarind seeds and is one of the most useful natural polymers. It has been used as a drug carrier in drug delivery because of its non-toxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. A solution of TSX can become a thermally reversible TSX hydrogel when its galactose molecules are partially removed. It was found that a galactose-removed TSX hydrogel is formed when two modified TSX chains form parallel-like structure in aqueous solution. Many molecular associations via hydrogen bonds between two modified TSX chains can promote its molecular aggregation. Moreover, it was reported that the lack of galactose molecules might be able to promote the aggregation of the β-glucan main chains through the hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the gelation. In this study, four double-chain TSX models with 50% galactose removal were used for the study of molecular aggregation in aqueous solution at its gelling temperature. Each model was built from eight monomer units of nonasaccharide (N, XLLG) and eight monomer units of heptasaccharide (H, XXXG), where G, X, and L are glucose (Glu), xylose (Xyl) substituted with glucose, and galactose (Gal) substituted with xyloglucose, respectively. The numbers of N and H are equal in all models, but the arrangements of N and H monomer units in each model are different. The simulated SAXS profiles of all models were also carried out. The roles of molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and molecular arrangements in molecular aggregation of 50% galactose removal of two TSX chains are discussed."
"Powder injection moulding of dental ceramic brackets using water soluble binder  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.Powder injection moulding (PIM) is one of mass production and cost effective near net shape processing, especially for small, complex-shaped components for high performance ceramic applications. Alumina has been generally known as one of the most widely used advanced ceramics due to its excellent properties such as high hardness, high strength, as well as its wear resistance and bioinertness. This work investigates PIM technique for a fabrication of alumina and zirconia toughened alumina compounds for dental ceramic brackets application. A water soluble binder system, composed of a major fraction of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a minor fraction polyvinyl butyral (PVB), has been studied in a preparation of feedstock for PIM. Injection moulding was carried out with a homemade laboratory scale equipment. PEG can be removed rapidly by water leaching. The remaining PVB is removed by subsequent calcination and the samples were then subjected to sintering. The development of feedstock formulations and processing parameters for the powder injection moulding of ceramic brackets has been investigated. The preliminary study showed that the water soluble binder can be used for the fabrication of alumina and zirconia toughened alumina parts by PIM technique. Samples retain their shape after leaching of the PEG in water. The rate of PEG removal is also fast at the initial stage. Density and microstructure of samples depended on feedstock formulars and sintering conditions. The relationship between processing parameters, properties and microstructure of the injection moulded samples were systematically examined."
"Optimizing Clinical Trial Design to Maximize Evidence Generation in Pediatric HIV Copyright  2018 The Author(s).For HIV-infected children, formulation development, pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and evaluation of early toxicity are critical for licensing new antiretroviral drugs; direct evidence of efficacy in children may not be needed if acceptable safety and PK parameters are demonstrated in children. However, it is important to address questions where adult trial data cannot be extrapolated to children. In this fast-moving area, interventions need to be tailored to resource-limited settings where most HIV-infected children live and take account of decreasing numbers of younger HIV-infected children after successful prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Innovative randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs enable several questions relevant to children’s treatment and care to be answered within the same study. We reflect on key considerations, and, with examples, discuss the relative merits of different RCT designs for addressing multiple scientific questions including parallel multi-arm RCTs, factorial RCTs, and crossover RCTs. We discuss inclusion of several populations (eg, untreated and pretreated children; children and adults) in “basket” trials; incorporation of secondary randomizations after enrollment and use of nested substudies (particularly PK and formulation acceptability) within large RCTs. We review the literature on trial designs across other disease areas in pediatrics and rare diseases and discuss their relevance for addressing questions relevant to HIV-infected children; we provide an example of a Bayesian trial design in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission and consider this approach for future pediatric trials. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these approaches to other areas, in particular, childhood tuberculosis and hepatitis."
"Risk factors for human papillomavirus infection and abnormal cervical cytology among perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-infected and uninfected asian youth  The Author(s) 2018.Background. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) may be higher in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (PHIV) than HIV-uninfected (HU) adolescents because of long-standing immune deficiency. Methods. PHIV and HU females aged 12-24 years in Thailand and Vietnam were matched by age group and lifetime sexual partners. At enrollment, blood, cervical, vaginal, anal, and oral samples were obtained for HPV-related testing. The Wilcoxon and Fisher exact tests were used for univariate and logistic regression for multivariate analyses. Results. Ninety-three PHIV and 99 HU adolescents (median age 19 [18-20] years) were enrolled (June 2013-July 2015). Among PHIV, 94% were currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, median CD4 count was 593 (392-808) cells/mm3, and 62% had a viral load <40 copies/mL. Across anogenital compartments, PHIV had higher rates of any HPV detected (80% vs 60%; P =.003) and any HR-HPV (60% vs 43%, P =.02). Higher proportions of PHIV had abnormal Pap smears (eg, atypical squamous cells of unknown significance [ASC-US], 12% vs 14%; low-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplastic lesions, 19% vs 1%). After adjusting for ever being pregnant and asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STI) at enrollment, PHIV were more likely to have HR-HPV than HU (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.77; P =.03). Conclusions. Perinatal HIV infection was associated with a higher risk of HR-HPV and abnormal cervical cytology. Our results underscore the need for HPV vaccination for PHIV adolescents and for prevention and screening programs for HPV and other STIs."
"Constraints on models of scalar and vector leptoquarks decaying to a quark and a neutrino at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN.The results of a previous search by the CMS Collaboration for squarks and gluinos are reinterpreted to constrain models of leptoquark (LQ) production. The search considers jets in association with a transverse momentum imbalance, using the MT2 variable. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data at s=13 TeV, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. Leptoquark pair production is considered with LQ decays to a neutrino and a top, bottom, or light quark. This reinterpretation considers higher mass values than the original CMS search to constrain both scalar and vector LQs. Limits on the cross section for LQ pair production are derived at the 95% confidence level depending on the LQ decay mode. A vector LQ decaying with a 50% branching fraction to tν, and 50% to bτ, has been proposed as part of an explanation of anomalous flavor physics results. In such a model, using only the decays to tν, LQ masses below 1530 GeV are excluded assuming the Yang-Mills case with coupling κ=1, or 1115 GeV in the minimal coupling case κ=0, placing the most stringent constraint to date from pair production of vector LQs."
"Search for vector-like T and B quark pairs in final states with leptons at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search is presented for pair production of heavy vector-like T and B quarks in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1, collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016. Pair production of T quarks would result in a wide range of final states, since vector-like T quarks of charge 2e/3 are predicted to decay to bW, tZ, and tH. Likewise, vector-like B quarks are predicted to decay to tW, bZ, and bH. Three channels are considered, corresponding to final states with a single lepton, two leptons with the same sign of the electric charge, or at least three leptons. The results exclude T quarks with masses below 1140–1300 GeV and B quarks with masses below 910–1240 GeV for various branching fraction combinations, extending the reach of previous CMS searches by 200–600 GeV.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Novel dual regulators of Pseudomonas aeruginosa essential for productive biofilms and virulence  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdGene regulation network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is complex. With a relatively large genome (6.2 Mb), there is a significant portion of genes that are proven or predicted to be transcriptional regulators. Many of these regulators have been shown to play important roles in biofilm formation and maintenance. In this study, we present a novel transcriptional regulator, PA1226, which modulates biofilm formation and virulence in P. aeruginosa. Mutation in the gene encoding this regulator abolished the ability of P. aeruginosa to produce biofilms in vitro, without any effect on the planktonic growth. This regulator is also essential for the in vivo fitness and pathogenesis in both Drosophila melanogaster and BALB/c mouse lung infection models. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PA1226 regulates many essential virulence genes/pathways, including those involved in alginate, pili, and LPS biosynthesis. Genes/operons directly regulated by PA1226 and potential binding sequences were identified via ChIP-seq. Attempts to confirm the binding sequences by electrophoretic mobility shift assay led to the discovery of a co-regulator, PA1413, via co-immunoprecipitation assay. PA1226 and PA1413 were shown to bind collaboratively to the promoter regions of their regulons. A model is proposed, summarizing our finding on this novel dual-regulation system."
"The structure-function analysis of the Mpr1 metalloprotease determinants of activity during migration of fungal cells across the blood-brain barrier  2018 Na Pombejra et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, the most common form of cryptococcosis, is caused by the opportunistic fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans. Molecular strategies used by C. neoformans to invade the central nervous system (CNS) have been the focus of several studies. Recently, the role of a novel secreted metalloprotease (Mpr1) in the pathogenicity of C. neoformans was confirmed by studies demonstrating that Mpr1 mediated the migration of fungal cells into the CNS. Given this central function, the aim here was to identify the molecular determinants of Mpr1 activity and resolve their role in the migration of cryptococci across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The Mpr1 protein belongs to an understudied group of metalloproteases of the M36 class of fungalysins unique to fungi. They are generally synthesized as propeptides with fairly long prodomains and highly conserved regions within their catalytic core. Through structure-function analysis of Mpr1, our study identified the prodomain cleavage sites of Mpr1 and demonstrated that when mutated, the prodomain appears to remain attached to the catalytic C-terminus of Mpr1 rendering a nonfunctional Mpr1 protein and an inability for cryptococci to cross the BBB. We found that proteolytic activity of Mpr1 was dependent on the coordination of zinc with two histidine residues in the active site of Mpr1, since amino acid substitutions in the HExxH motif abolished Mpr1 proteolytic activity and prevented the migration of cryptococci across the BBB. A phylogenetic analysis of Mpr1 revealed a distinct pattern likely reflecting the neurotropic nature of C. neoformans and the specific function of Mpr1 in breaching the BBB. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular regulation of Mpr1 activity and may lead to the development of specific inhibitors that could be used to restrict fungal penetration of the CNS and thus prevent cryptococcal meningoencephalitis-related deaths."
"Constructing an academic thai plagiarism corpus for benchmarking plagiarism detection systems  2018, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press. All rights reserved.Plagiarism is a major problem in the academic world. It does not only undermine the credibility of educational institutions, but also interrupts the processes of creating knowledge in the academic community. To lessen this problem, many plagiarism detection systems have been developed to detect plagiarized texts in academic works. In this paper, we describe the design and process in creating an academic Thai plagiarism corpus. This corpus is necessary for training and testing plagiarism detection systems for Thai. In order to make this corpus a comprehensive representation of plagiarism, the data has been divided into various types based on the degree of the linguistic mechanisms used in plagiarism. Data compiled in our corpus comes through two main methods: manually created by participants and automatically generated by a program. After the corpus is created, its validity is verified by using three measurements: a measurement of similarity between suspicious texts at the character level, a measurement of similarity between suspicious texts at the word level, and a comparison of different types of data compiled in the corpus based on the similarity measured. The results of the analyses indicate that the corpus created by the proposed methods is effective in training and testing plagiarism detection systems."
"Are there maximum compatible concentrations of calcium gluconate and sodium glycerophosphate in infant parenteral nutrition solutions?  2018, Pharmainfo Publications. All rights reserved.Background: Calcium gluconate and sodium glycerophosphate (NaGP) were claimed to reduce risk of precipitation in infant parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions which contained high amounts of calcium and phosphorus. Objective: To determine the compatibility of calcium gluconate and NaGP at high concentrations in PN solutions with different amino acid concentrations and storage conditions. Methods: PN solutions consisted of 1.5-2.5% amino acid, 0-100 mM/l calcium gluconate and 0-150 mM/l NaGP in constant amounts of dextrose, sodium chloride, and magnesium sulfate. The solutions were kept under 3 conditions; 30°C for 1 d, 4°C for 1 d and 4°C for 7 d. Compatibility initially evaluated by pH measurement and visual inspection. Solutions were then measured turbidity and further observed under a light microscope for microscopic particle count test. PN solution was determined to be compatible if particle counts of three replicates were under USP criteria. Results: PN solutions containing 1.5% and 2.0% amino acid with high concentrations of calcium gluconate and NaGP showed precipitation.Fifty mM/l calcium gluconate was compatible with 150 mM/l NaGP as freshly prepared and 100 mM/l NaGP as kept in 30°C for 1 d, respectively. At any storage conditions of solutions containing 2.5% amino acid, 75 mM/l of calcium gluconate was compatible with 100 mM/l NaGP. Conclusion: The use of calcium gluconate and NaGP in PN solutions allowed high compatible concentrations of calcium and phosphorus. These organic salts should feasibly be applied in prescription and compounding of infant PN solutions."
"Cooperative corpus consultation for acquisition of adjective + preposition collocations  2018, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press. All rights reserved.Teaching collocations through corpus consultation can highlight not only linguistic patterns but also association between meaning and patterns. However, previous studies have reported learners’ problems during corpus consultation. Corpus consultation refers to learning activities in which a group of learners explore concordance lines in a corpus as to observe language patterns. It is assumed that the integration of group work into corpus consultation tends to facilitate the learning process. The study therefore investigated the effects of cooperative corpus consultation on the acquisition of L2 English adjective + preposition collocations. The participants were 74 first-year Thai undergraduate students divided into a control and an experimental group with 38 and 36 learners, respectively. The instruments were corpus-based materials and activities covering both paper-based and online activities, a pre-test and a post-test. While the control group consulted the corpus individually, the experimental group employed the cooperative corpus consultation approach before both groups took the post-test. The statistical results showed a significant difference in the pre-test and the post-test results of the experimental group, in both production and perception of the targeted collocations. The findings suggested that cooperative corpus consultation could promote discussion and cooperation in the experimental group, resulting in the acquisition of the adjective + preposition collocations."
"Search for narrow and broad dijet resonances in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV and constraints on dark matter mediators and other new particles  2018, The Author(s).Searches for resonances decaying into pairs of jets are performed using proton-proton collision data collected at s=13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 36 fb−1. A low-mass search, for resonances with masses between 0.6 and 1.6 TeV, is performed based on events with dijets reconstructed at the trigger level from calorimeter information. A high-mass search, for resonances with masses above 1.6 TeV, is performed using dijets reconstructed offline with a particle-flow algorithm. The dijet mass spectrum is well described by a smooth parameterization and no evidence for the production of new particles is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are reported on the production cross section for narrow resonances with masses above 0.6 TeV. In the context of specific models, the limits exclude string resonances with masses below 7.7 TeV, scalar diquarks below 7.2 TeV, axigluons and colorons below 6.1 TeV, excited quarks below 6.0 TeV, color-octet scalars below 3.4 TeV, W′ bosons below 3.3 TeV, Z′ bosons below 2.7 TeV, Randall-Sundrum gravitons below 1.8 TeV and in the range 1.9 to 2.5 TeV, and dark matter mediators below 2.6 TeV. The limits on both vector and axial-vector mediators, in a simplified model of interactions between quarks and dark matter particles, are presented as functions of dark matter particle mass and coupling to quarks. Searches are also presented for broad resonances, including for the first time spin-1 resonances with intrinsic widths as large as 30% of the resonance mass. The broad resonance search improves and extends the exclusions of a dark matter mediator to larger values of its mass and coupling to quarks.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Effect of obstructive sleep apnea and its treatment of atrial fibrillation recurrence after radiofrequency catheter ablation: A meta-analysis  2018 Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdBackground/objectives: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have an increased the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF). However, it remains unclear if patients with OSA carry a higher risk of recurrent AF after successful catheter ablation. This meta-analysis was conducted (1) to evaluate the association between OSA and recurrent AF after catheter ablation, and (2) to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the risk of recurrent AF in patients with OSA. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases from inception through July 2017 to identify studies that evaluated the risk of recurrent AF after successful catheter ablation in patients with OSA were included. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Seven observational studies with a total of 4572 patients AF after successful catheter ablation were enrolled. Compared to patients without OSA, the pooled OR of recurrent AF in patients with OSA was 1.70 (95% CI, 1.40-2.06, I2 = 0). Among OSA patients with AF after successful catheter ablation, the use of CPAP was significantly associated with decreased risk of recurrent AF with pooled OR of 0.28 (0.19-0.40, I2= 0). Egger's regression asymmetry test was performed and showed no publication bias for the associations of OSA and CPAP with recurrent AF. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggested a significant association between OSA and recurrent AF after catheter ablation. The use of CPAP in patients with OSA is associated with reduced risk of recurrent AF after catheter ablation."

Upper limits are set on the product of the production cross section for the resonance and the branching fraction for the selected decay mode in the resonance mass range from 260 to 1200 GeV.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Outcomes of clinical practice guideline for sepsis patients in Taksin hospital  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Sepsis is a serious disease with a high mortality rate. Objective: To study the effect of a Clinical Practice Guideline [CPG] on mortality for sepsis patient management in Thailand. Materials and Methods: The design was a retrospective study. The medical records of 472 severe sepsis or septic shock patients treated prior to and after the hospital sepsis CPG implementation in hospital were reviewed. Results: Four hundred seventy-two patients were eligible for enrollment. The mortality rate was statistically significant different among studied patients in pre-implementation period (43.6%) and implementation period (13.1%) (p<0.001). There was statistically higher percentage of patients who received antibiotics within the first hours of being diagnosed with sepsis in implementation period (97.9%), compared with pre-implementation period (74.2%) (p<0.001). The significant higher numbers of patients in implementation period having enough volume replacement within the first six hours of severe sepsis or septic shock diagnosis compared with in pre-implementation period, as measured by an adequate urine output (≥0.5 ml/kg/hour) (84.6% versus 73.8%) (p = 0.018), and by an adequate central venous pressure (8 to 12 mmHg) (82.4% versus 43.3%) (p<0.001). In addition, there were significant difference in the percentages of patients having a reversal of septic shock in pre-implementation and implementation period (94.8% versus 88.4%) (p = 0.02). Conclusion: An implementation of the sepsis CPG in secondary-care hospital led to increase appropriate management and decrease mortality among the severe sepsis patients."
"Prevalence of psychiatric disorders in homeless population in Bangkok, Thailand  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To find the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the homeless population in Bangkok, Thailand Materials and Methods: In an epidemiological survey of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in homeless individuals at Lan Khon Meaung, Sao Chingcha in Bangkok, Thailand, a probability sample of 113 homeless people were interviewed using a Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]. Results: There was a high prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders among homeless people (76%). The most frequent psychiatric disorders were major depressive episode (current two weeks prevalence rate 35.7%) psychotic disorders (lifetime prevalence rate 31.0%), psychotic disorders (current two weeks prevalence rate 23%), alcohol dependence (past 12 months prevalence rate 22.1%), and major depressive episode melancholic features (current two weeks prevalence rate 19.5%). The prevalence of suicidal risk and two or more psychiatric comorbidities factors in severe psychiatric disorders group were higher than the others, with a statistical significance (p-value 0.003 and 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Prevalence of psychiatric disorders in homeless population in Bangkok is higher among the homeless than in the general population, especially severe psychiatric disorders. An urgent need for adequate medical and psychiatric care and the development of concepts for rehabilitation should be established."
"Utilization of immunization service and predictors among under 3-year-old children in urban slums of Chanmyathazi Township, Mandalay, Myanmar  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To identify the prevalence of immunization and predictors of utilization of immunization service among under-3-year-old children in urban slums of Chanmyathazi Township, Mandalay. The outcome variables used for the present study were whether the child received complete types of EPI immunization, immunization with timeliness and utilization of immunization service. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional community surveys by using cluster sampling was applied to select 429 primary caregivers of under-3-year-old children. Face to face interview was conducted using four parts of structured questionnaire. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were performed to examine factors associated with utilization of immunization. Results: The prevalence of the children with complete and partial type of immunization according to national schedule were 24.1% and 64.8%, respectively, whereas 11.1% of them were never immunized. Regarding timeliness, 26.5% of the immunized children had the timely vaccinations, while about three-quarters (73.5%) had delayed immunization. In terms of utilization of immunization status, 23% of the caregiver utilized the service with quality immunization and 77% of them did not utilize the service. In multiple logistic regression analysis, child age (AOR 3.49, 95% CI 1.63 to 7.50), income (AOR 6.36, 95% CI 2.35 to 17.18), migration status (AOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.05 to 10.29), ANC visit (AOR 4.77, 95% CI 1.55 to 14.67), receiving additional vaccine (AOR 6.27, 95% CI 2.72 to 14.44), and having immunization card (AOR 3.15, 95% CI 1.33 to 7.46) were significantly predicted for the utilization of the immunization service (p-value <0.05). Conclusion: This study found that a comprehensive maternal and child health care system that promote ANC together with immunization uptake and health promotion programs on additional vaccine for preventable diseases such as Rotavirus infection and Japanese encephalitis in the community level is needed. Using appropriate software to keep health records in form of electronic registration for slum migrants is also needed."

"Reintubation in the post-anesthesia care unit [PACU] from the first 2,000 incidents: Perioperative and anesthetic adverse events in Thailand [PAAd Thai] study  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To investigate anesthesia-related adverse events focusing on reintubation in the post-anesthesia care unit [PACU] from the Perioperative and Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand [PAAd Thai] Study hosted by the Royal College of Anesthesiologists of Thailand. Materials and Methods: All relevant incident reports of reintubation that occurred in the PACU out of the first 2,000 incident reports from 22 hospitals between January 1 and December 31, 2015 were reviewed by three senior anesthesiologists. Any disagreement was solved by consensus after discussion. Descriptive statistics was used. Results: There were 107 incident reports of reintubation from the 221 incidents occurring in the PACU. Forty-nine patients (45.9%) and 11 patients (10.3%) were patients with age over 60 years and younger than 10 years. Sixty-four (59.8%) cases were ASA physical status 3 and 4 while higher risk were patients in general, orthopedic, neurological, obstetric & gynecological and urological surgeries. Two-thirds of incidents occurred in service-based hospitals and in emergency condition. Usage of neuromuscular blocking agents (83.9%), midazolam (17.8%), morphine (28%), and fentanyl (73.8%) were considered as anesthesia related factors. Fifty-one percent of patients receiving non-depolarizing muscle relaxant were extubated without reversal agents. Respiratory physiologic changes, particularly oxygen desaturation (37.4%), unplanned ICU admission (33.6%), and prolonged ventilatory support (31.8%) were common outcomes. After reviewing all incidents, patients (66.4%), anesthetic (74.8%), and knowledge-based error (57.9%) were common factors while 52.3% of cases were considered as preventable. Conclusion: Incidence of reintubation in the PACU dramatically decreased over a decade. Contribution factors were human factors (inappropriate decision making, inadequate preanesthetic evaluation, and inexperience). Factor minimizing incidents were vigilance and having experience. Suggested strategies are improvement of supervision, quality assurance activity, practice guidelines, additional training, and improvement of communication."
"Long-term clinical and histological evaluation of PoreSkin: A human acellular dermal matrix in burn scars, a descriptive clinical study  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: PoreSkin, a first and only human acellular dermal matrix [hADM] developed in Thailand, has been reported to have a satisfactory engraftment rate without any signs of rejection or any other complications in the treatment of burn scars. Although a previous study had demonstrated the favorable short-term clinical results, the long-term clinical, and histological results should be evaluated. Objective: To assess the long-term clinical and histological results in burn scars treated with PoreSkin for more than 18 months. Materials and Methods: Ten patients with burn scar deformities had been treated with PoreSkin placement and subsequent delayed thin split-thickness skin grafting for more than 18 months were enrolled in the present study. Percentage of scar contraction was measured using the standard graph paper technique. Vancouver scar scale was used to evaluate the improvement of the scar quality. Punch biopsy specimens from the grafted area were taken for light and electron microscopic examination. Results: After 18 months, the mean contraction percentage of the area treated with PoreSkin and subsequent delayed thin split-thickness skin grafting is 44.6% (22.8% to 55.9%). Scar quality is significantly improved according to Vancouver scar scale. Histological finding showed no inflammatory cells, normal capillary formation, increased fibroblast, and collagen proliferation; however, most of them were in disorganized pattern. Conclusion: The long-term result of PoreSkin reconstruction as a dermal substitute showed significant improvements in grafted area scar quality. Substantial area of contraction had occurred. Normal capillary formation was identified. Increased fibroblast and collagen proliferation although in disorganized arrangement were presented in all specimens. No inflammatory cell was found."
"Unraveling the structural and molecular properties of 34-residue levans with various branching degrees by replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations  2018 Chunsrivirot et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Levan has various potential applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries, such as cholesterol-lowering agents and prebiotics, due to its beneficial properties, which depend on its length and branching degree. A previous study also found that the branching degree of levan affected anti-tumor activities against SNU-1 and HepG2 tumor cell lines. Despite its promising potential, the properties of levans with different branching degrees are not well understood at the molecular level. In two models of the generalized Born implicit solvent (GBHCT and GBOBC1), we employed replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations to explore conformational spaces of 34-residue levans (L34) with branching degrees of zero (LFO34B0), one (LFO34B1), three (LFO34B3) and five (LFO34B5), as well as to elucidate their structural and molecular properties. To ensure a fair comparison of the effects of branching degree on these properties, we focused on analyzing the properties of the central 21-resi-due of the main chains of all systems. Our results show that all major representative conformations tend to form helix-like structures with kinks, where two-kink helix-like structures have the highest population. As branching degree increases, the population of helix-like structures with zero or one kink tends to increase slightly. As the number of kinks in the structures with the same branching degree increases, the average values of the lengths and angles among centers of masses of three consecutive turns of residue i, i+3, and i+6 tended to decrease. Due to its highest occurring frequencies, the O6 (i)—H3O (i+1) hydrogen bond could be important for helix-like structure formation. Moreover, hydrogen bonds forming among the branching residue (br), branching position (bp) and other residues of L34B1, L34B3 and L34B5 were identified. The O1(bp)—H3O(br), O1(br)—H3O(br) and O5(br)—H1O(br) hydrogen bonds were found in the first-, second- and third-highest occurrence frequencies, respectively. Our study provides novel and important insights into conformational spaces and the structural and molecular properties of 34-residue levans with various branching degrees, which tend to form helix-like structures with kinks."
"The association of PNPLA3, COX-2 and DHCR7 polymorphisms with advanced liver fibrosis in patients with HCV mono- infection and HCV/HIV co-infection  2018 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.There is increasing evidence that host genetic variations may influence the natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of this study was to determine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PNPLA3 (rs738409), COX-2 (rs689465) and DHCR7 (rs12785878) and advanced liver fibrosis in Thai patients. A total of 220 patients with HCV mono-infection, 200 patients with HCV/HIV co-infection and 200 healthy controls were enrolled. The SNPs were detected by allelic discrimination using real-time PCR with TaqMan probes. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) was assessed by transient elastography. Our results showed that the distribution of the studied SNPs were not significantly different between the HCV mono- and co-infected groups. The frequencies AG and GG genotypes of rs689465 and GG genotype of rs12785878 were less commonly found in the HCV mono- and co-infected groups compare with healthy controls (P < 0.01). Among patients with HCV infection, older age, HIV co-infection, GG genotype of rs738409 and GG genotype of rs689465 were independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis (LSM=9.5 kPa) in multivariate analysis. Moreover, the percentage of patients with advanced liver fibrosis increased significantly along with the accumulated numbers of these risk genotypes. In conclusion, PNPLA3 (rs738409) and COX-2 (rs689465) polymorphisms were associated with advanced liver fibrosis in patients with HCV mono- and co-infection, suggesting that these variants might play an important role in progressive liver fibrosis in these patients."
"Birth-cohort HCV screening target in Thailand to expand and optimize the national HCV screening for public health policy  2018 Wasitthankasem et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The World Health Organization aims to eliminate HCV infection worldwide by 2030. A targeted HCV screening policy is currently unavailable in Thailand, but a decrease in HCV infection has been observed in the country. However, a previous study showed that there was a higher HCV seroprevalence in adults aged between 30–64 years in the Phetchabun province (15.5%), as compared to the Khon Kaen province (3.6%). It was hypothesized that young adults had a lower rate of HCV seropositivity; this was determined by the age distribution of anti-HCV in Phetchabun and with the identification of high seroprevalence birth cohorts. In order to compare the provincial findings to the national level, anti-HCV birth cohorts were further analyzed in Khon Kaen (averaged-HCV prevalence) as well as the Thai data set that was derived from the previous literature. Thai individuals aged between 18–30 years residing in Phetchabun (n = 1453) were recruited, tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and viral RNA and completed questionnaires that were designed to identify HCV exposure risks. Data was collected and compiled from previously published articles (n = 1667, age 30–64 years). The HCV seropositivity in Phetchabun by age group (18–64, at 5-year intervals) and the birth year were tabulated parallel to the Khon Kaen data set (n = 2233) in conjunction with data from the national survey 2014 (n = 5964) representing the Thai population. Factors such as age, male gender, agricultural work, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and having a tattoo were associated with anti-HCV positivity in Phetchabun. HCV seroprevalence was less than 4.0% (ranging from 0.0–3.5%) from the age of 18–34 years. A dramatic increase of 15.1% was found in adults aged greater than or equal to 35 years, whereas, the age group in Khon Kaen and the national population with increasing prevalence of HCV were older (40). The HCV seropositivity cohort accumulated for those born between 1951–1982 accounted for 71.4–100.0% of all seropositive individuals. Subsequently, new cases occurred sporadically. This finding provides evidence that there is a disproportionately high HCV seroprevalence among people born before 1983 (or aged 35). This cohort should be targeted for priority screening as part of the national HCV screening policy. Incorporating this birth cohort with other risk factors could improve HCV diagnostic rates, resulting in overall improvements in parallel to those given by novel antiviral treatment."
"Measurement of the cross section for top quark pair production in association with a W or Z boson in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A measurement is performed of the cross section of top quark pair production in association with a W or Z boson using proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1, collected by the CMS experiment in 2016. The measurement is performed in the same-sign dilepton, three- and four-lepton final states. The production cross sections are measured to be σ(tt¯W)=0.77−0.11+0.12(stat)−0.12+0.13(syst)pb and σ(tt¯Z)=0.99−0.08+0.09(stat)−0.10+0.12(syst)pb. The expected (observed) signal significance for the t t ¯ W production in same-sign dilepton channel is found to be 4.5 (5.3) standard deviations, while for the t t ¯ Z production in three- and four-lepton channels both the expected and the observed significances are found to be in excess of 5 standard deviations. The results are in agreement with the standard model predictions and are used to constrain the Wilson coefficients for eight dimension-six operators describing new interactions that would modify t t ¯ W and t t ¯ Z production.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Search for beyond the standard model Higgs bosons decaying into a b b ¯ pair in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for Higgs bosons that decay into a bottom quark-antiquark pair and are accompanied by at least one additional bottom quark is performed with the CMS detector. The data analyzed were recorded in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of s=13 TeV at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.7 fb−1. The final state considered in this analysis is particularly sensitive to signatures of a Higgs sector beyond the standard model, as predicted in the generic class of two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs). No signal above the standard model background expectation is observed. Stringent upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are set for Higgs bosons with masses up to 1300 GeV. The results are interpreted within several MSSM and 2HDM scenarios.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Evidence for associated production of a Higgs boson with a top quark pair in final states with electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying τ leptons at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Results of a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top quark pair (t t ¯ H) in final states with electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying τ leptons are presented. The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 recorded in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV by the CMS experiment in 2016. The sensitivity of the search is improved by using matrix element and machine learning methods to separate the signal from backgrounds. The measured signal rate amounts to 1.23− 0.43 + 0.45 times the production rate expected in the standard model, with an observed (expected) significance of 3.2σ (2.8σ), which represents evidence for t t ¯ H production in those final states. An upper limit on the signal rate of 2.1 times the standard model production rate is set at 95% confidence level.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Implementation of hepatitis B vaccine in high-risk young adults with waning immunity This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose. The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication.Universal hepatitis B (HB) vaccination among Thai newborns was initiated in 1992. The first dose of the monovalent HB vaccine was given at birth, then at months 2 and 6 simultaneously with the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis whole-cell (DTPw) vaccine. In 2008, Thailand replaced the monovalent HB vaccine at months 2 and 6 with a combined DTP-HB given at months 2, 4, and 6, with an added monovalent HB vaccine at month 1 for infants whose mothers were HBV carriers. Despite this rigorous HB vaccination schedule, vaccinated infants who are now adolescents do not possess a protective level of anti-HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) (10 mIU/ml). Thus, many young adults may be rendered susceptible to HB infection. Our objective was to determine how HB booster vaccination may benefit high-risk adolescents. We evaluated the serological records of a cohort of medical students (n = 291), which showed that 271 students (93.1%) possessed anti-HBs less than the accepted protective level (<10 mIU/ml) and subsequently received the HB vaccine booster prior to medical school enrollment. We then examined the anti-HB surface antibody (anti-HBs) in 216 individuals six weeks after they were immunized. We found that 61%, 88%, and 94% of individuals with pre-booster anti-HBs of <1 mIU/ml, 1-<3 mIU/ml, and 3-<10 mIU/ml achieved protective anti-HBs, respectively. Post-booster geometric mean titers were 305, 513, and 1,929 mIU/ml in these groups and correlated with pre-booster anti-HBs titers. These data suggest that medical students with known anti-HBs <1 mIU/ml will benefit from 3 doses of HB vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months. Students with anti-HBs 1-<10 mIU/ml would benefit from an HB vaccine booster without further anti-HBs evaluation."
"DNA barcoding of Aristolochia plants and development of species-specific multiplex PCR to aid HPTLC in ascertainment of Aristolochia herbal materials  2018 Dechbumroong et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The anecdotal evidence is outstanding on the uses of Aristolochia plants as traditional medicines and dietary supplements in many regions of the world. However, herbal materials derived from Aristolochia species have been identified as potent human carcinogens since the first case of severe renal disease after ingesting these herbal preparations. Any products containing Aristolochia species have thus been banned on many continents, including Europe, America and Asia. Therefore, the development of a method to identify these herbs is critically needed for customer safety. The present study evaluated DNA barcoding of the rbcL, matK, ITS2 and trnH-psbA regions among eleven Aristolochia species collected in Thailand. Polymorphic sites were observed in all four DNA loci. Among those eleven Aristolochia species, three species (A. pierrei, A. tagala and A. pothieri) are used as herbal materials in Thai folk medicine, namely, in Thai “Krai-Krue”. “Krai-Krue” herbs are interchangeably used as an admixture in Thai traditional remedies without specific knowledge of their identities. A species-specific multiplex PCR based on nucleotide polymorphisms in the ITS2 region was developed as an identification tool to differentiate these three Aristolochia species and to supplement the HPTLC pattern in clarifying the origins of herbal materials. The combination of multiplex PCR and HPTLC profiling achieves accurate herbal identification with the goal of protecting consumers from the health risks associated with product substitution and contamination."
"Higgs mechanism in nonlocal field theories  2018, The Author(s).We study spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism in nonlocal field theories. Motivated by the level truncated action of string field theory, we consider a class of nonlocal field theories with an exponential factor of the d’Alembertian attached to the kinetic and mass terms. Modifications of this kind are known to make mild the UV behavior of loop diagrams and thus have been studied not only in the context of string theory but also as an alternative approach to quantum gravity. In this paper we argue that such a nonlocal theory potentially includes a ghost mode near the nonlocal scale in the particle spectrum of the symmetry broken phase. This is in sharp contrast to local field theories and would be an obstruction to making a simple nonlocal model a UV complete theory. We then discuss a possible way out by studying nonlocal theories with extra symmetries such as gauge symmetries in higher spacetime dimensions."
"Computerized Cytomorphometric and Cytomorphological Analysis of Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumours  2018 Elsevier LtdCanine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT) has three cytomorphological types: plasmacytic, lymphocytic and mixed type. Cytomorphometry, a method of computerized image analysis, has been used recently in veterinary medicine. This study compared the nuclear and cellular morphometric parameters (i.e. radius, diameter, perimeter and area) in different types of CTVT with other canine round cell tumours including lymphoma, mast cell tumour (MCT) and histiocytic tumour (HCT). We also evaluated the relationship between clinical information and the different CTVT cytomorphologic types. CTVT cells from 44 dogs revealed that the measured parameters were significantly different between different round cell tumours and among the CTVT cytomorphological types. CTVT had the largest cells, followed by HCTs, MCTs and lymphomas. The mixed type of CTVT had the largest nuclear and cellular size, followed by the plasmacytic and lymphocytic types. Lymphocytic CTVTs had less aggressive biological behaviour than the other types. Mixed type CTVTs were more likely to show malignant behaviour including metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy; however, there was no significant correlation between cytomorphological type of CTVT and response to chemotherapy."
"Search for disappearing tracks as a signature of new long-lived particles in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search is presented for long-lived charged particles that decay within the CMS detector and produce the signature of a disappearing track. A disappearing track is an isolated track with missing hits in the outer layers of the silicon tracker, little or no energy in associated calorimeter deposits, and no associated hits in the muon detectors. This search uses data collected with the CMS detector in 2015 and 2016 from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38.4 fb−1. The results of the search are interpreted in the context of the anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking model. The data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis. Limits are set on the product of the cross section for direct production of charginos and their branching fraction to a neutralino and a pion, as a function of the chargino mass and lifetime. At 95% confidence level, charginos with masses below 715 (695) GeV are excluded for a lifetime of 3 (7) ns, as are charginos with lifetimes from 0.5 to 60 ns for a mass of 505 GeV. These are the most stringent limits using a disappearing track signature on this signal model for chargino lifetimes above ≈0.7 ns.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Topical Botulinum Toxin Type A Liposomal Cream for Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Split-Site, Vehicle-Controlled Study  2018 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.BACKGROUND Despite its effectiveness in treating primary axillary hyperhidrosis (PAH), topical botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) is highly resistant to transdermal absorption. Topical BTX-A liposomal cream is recommended as a novel, noninvasive modality to enhance skin penetration.OBJECTIVETo evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical BTX-A liposomal cream in comparison with liposomal vehicle cream alone in the treatment of PAH.MATERIALS AND METHODSA prospective, randomized, double-blinded, split-site study was conducted in 20 subjects, aged 18 to 50 years, all of whom had symmetrical axillary sweating with Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale scores between 2 to 4. All subjects were double-blinded to treatment regimens and randomly given 2 bottles, one containing topical BTX-A liposomal cream and one containing the vehicle cream without BTX-A, to be applied consistently to the same axilla nightly for 7 consecutive days. Clinical improvement and adverse reactions were evaluated at every follow-up visit.RESULTSAxillary skin treated with topical BTX-A demonstrated superior sweat reduction and patient satisfaction to vehicle cream-treated axillary skin, with clinical and statistical significance, at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 of follow-up, without adverse effects.CONCLUSIONTopical BTX-A liposomal cream pharmaceutically enhances drug delivery, is painless, cost-effective, and overall an innovative treatment of PAH."
"Holographic RG flows in N= 4 SCFTs from half-maximal gauged supergravity  2018, The Author(s).We study four-dimensional N= 4 gauged supergravity coupled to six vector multiplets with semisimple gauge groups SO(4) × SO(4) , SO(3 , 1) × SO(3 , 1) and SO(4) × SO(3 , 1). All of these gauge groups are dyonically embedded in the global symmetry group SO(6, 6) via its maximal subgroup SO(3 , 3) × SO(3 , 3). For SO(4) × SO(4) gauge group, there are four N= 4 supersymmetric AdS4 vacua with SO(4) × SO(4) , SO(4) × SO(3) , SO(3) × SO(4) and SO(3) × SO(3) symmetries, respectively. These AdS4 vacua correspond to N= 4 SCFTs in three dimensions with SO(4) R-symmetry and different flavor symmetries. We explicitly compute the full scalar mass spectra at all these vacua. Holographic RG flows interpolating between these conformal fixed points are also given. The solutions describe supersymmetric deformations of N= 4 SCFTs by relevant operators of dimensions Δ = 1 , 2. A number of these solutions can be found analytically although some of them can only be obtained numerically. These results provide a rich and novel class of N= 4 fixed points in three-dimensional Chern–Simons-Matter theories and possible RG flows between them in the framework of N= 4 gauged supergravity in four dimensions. Similar studies are carried out for non-compact gauge groups, but the SO(4) × SO(4) gauge group exhibits a much richer structure."
"Associations of sleep quality with incident atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis  2018 Royal Australasian College of PhysiciansBackground: The strong relationship between sleep apnoea and atrial fibrillation (AF) is well known. However, it remains unclear whether the sleep quality is related with AF. Aim: To evaluate the associations of sleep duration, insomnia and frequent awakening with AF. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases from inception through September 2017 to identify studies that evaluate the risk of AF in adults with short sleep duration, long sleep duration, insomnia and/or frequent awakening. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Ten observational studies (14 296 314 patients) were enrolled. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of AF in individuals with short sleep (<6 h) and long sleep (>8 h) were 1.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.55, I2 = 66%) and 1.24 (95% CI 0.96–1.62, I2 = 58%), respectively. There was no association between increase in sleep duration and AF, with a pooled OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.84–1.12, I2 = 0%). However, there were significant associations of AF with insomnia and frequent awakening, with pooled ORs of 1.30 (95% CI 1.26–1.35, I2 = 3%) and 1.36 (95% CI 1.13–1.63, I2 = 55%), respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest an absence in association between AF and sleep duration but reveal the potential association between AF and both insomnia and frequent nocturnal awakening. As such, the further studies on association of AF and sleep qualities are warranted."
"A Cadaveric Study of Ultrasound-Guided Maxillary Nerve Block Via the Pterygopalatine Fossa: A Novel Technique Using the Lateral Pterygoid Plate Approach  2018 by American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.Background and Objectives This study aimed to describe and assess the accuracy and feasibility of a novel technique for ultrasound-guided maxillary nerve block using the lateral pterygoid plate (LPP) approach via the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) in a soft cadaveric model. Methods Ten soft cadavers were studied. The curved array ultrasound transducer probe was applied over 1 side of the face of the cadavers in the open-mouth posture. It was placed transversely below the zygomatic arch for identifying the border of the maxillary tuberosity and the LPP. We tilted the curve probe from the caudal to the cranial direction until the uppermost part of the PPF was identified. The in-plane needle approach was used from the anterior-to-posterior and lateral-to-medial directions through the fossa, and 3 mL of methylene blue dye was injected. Results The spread of injectate after ultrasound-guided maxillary nerve block using the LPP approach was successfully performed in all cadavers as demonstrated by visualized moderate to marked traces of methylene blue within the PPF. No accidental injections in the maxillary arteries or facial nerves were observed. Conclusions This cadaveric study suggests that ultrasound-guided maxillary nerve block using the LPP approach via the PPF has a high degree of accuracy and feasibility. Further studies are required to confirm its efficacy and safety for clinical application."
"Characterization of Cellular Immune Responses in Thai Individuals with and Without HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. HIV-Associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains a challenge despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), and has been linked to monocyte/macrophage (M/M) migration to the brain. Due to the potential impact of T cell effector mechanisms in eliminating activated/HIV-infected M/M, T cell activation may play a role in the development of HAND. We sought to investigate the relationship between cognition and both CD8 + T cell activation (HLA-DR + /CD38 + ) and HIV-specific CD8 + T cell responses at the time of HIV diagnosis and 12 months postinitiation of ART. CD8 + T cell activation was increased in HAND compared to cognitive normal (NL) individuals and correlated directly with plasma viral load and inversely with the cognitive status. In addition, Gag-specific cytolytic activity (CD107a/b + ) was decreased in HAND compared with NL individuals and correlated with their neurological testing, suggesting a potential role of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells in the mechanism of HAND development."
"Topography of the dorsal nasal artery and its clinical implications for augmentation of the dorsum of the nose  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Injections of filler into the nose for dorsum augmentation have a higher risk of complications due to the complicated blood supply and anastomotic channels in this area. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the anatomical features and location of the dorsal nasal artery (DNA), and to provide clinical anatomical information to reduce side effects and severe complications in the perinasal area. Methods: Using the 31 cadaveric noses in Asians, dissections and histologic examinations were performed to identify the location and depth of the vascular structures including DNA. Results: Dorsal nasal artery ran downward at 20.3 ± 3.5 mm from the intercanthal line and the communicating branch that connected the bilateral DNAs was located 8.5 ± 3.5 mm inferior to the intercanthal line. The DNA was located at 4.4 ± 3.2 mm, 4.6 ± 4.4 mm, and 5.2 ± 4.4 mm lateral to the midline of the nose on the intercanthal, quadrisected, and bisected lines, respectively. At the level of nasal bone, DNA was located superficial to the muscular layer and it runs inferolaterally on dorsum on nose. It was running more deeply and located beneath the fibromuscular layer at the cartilaginous portion of the dorsum of nose. Conclusions: Injection into deep fatty layer may reduce the risk of arterial injury and the consequent complications. However, in a hooked nose, the tip of the needle traveling along the deep layer approaches the superficial layer due to the convexity of the hump as it passes over it, which can increase the probability of damaging the DNA."
"Cole-Carpenter syndrome in a patient from Thailand  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Cole-Carpenter syndrome (CCS), commonly classified as a rare type of osteogenesis imperfecta, is a disorder with severe bone fragility, craniosynostosis, and distinct facial features. Recently, the heterozygous missense mutation, c.1178A>G, p.Tyr393Cys, in exon 9 of P4HB which encodes protein disulfide isomerase, has been found in three Caucasian patients with CCS. Ethnic background is known to affect clinical manifestations, especially facial features of dysmorphic syndromes. Here, we describe the first Asian CCS patient possessing the recurrent mutation in P4HB. Although she had several common features of CCS including bulging forehead, ocular proptosis, midface hypoplasia, long bone deformity, popcorn epiphyses, vertebral fractures, and scoliosis, she did not have hydrocephalus, wormian bones, and dentinogenesis imperfecta, commonly seen in Caucasian patients. Interestingly, she is the only one without macrocephaly. Radiologically, metadiaphyseal fractures of the long bones with metaphyseal sclerosis were found, substantiating that they provide a definitive radiological feature of CCS. In addition, we showed for the first time a three-dimensional facial scan of a patient with CCS. She had been given intravenous bisphosphonate since the age of 9 months and had responded well. Our study presents the clinical features of the first Asian patient, supports metaphyseal scleroses and fractures as radiological clues, strengthens early bisphosphonate administration, and confirms the etiologic role of the c.1178A>G variant in P4HB across populations."
"Monitoring anti-pythium insidiosum IgG antibodies and (1¡3)-D-Glucan in vascular pythiosis  2018 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.Despite aggressive treatment, vascular pythiosis has a mortality rate of 40%. This is due to delays in diagnosis and a lack of effective monitoring tools. To overcome this drawback, serum beta-D-glucan (BG) and P. insidiosum-specific antibody (Pi-Ab) were examined as potential monitoring markers in vascular pythiosis. A prospective cohort study of vascular pythiosis patients was carried out from January 2010 to July 2016. Clinical information and blood samples were collected and evaluated by the BG and Pi-Ab assays. Linear mixed-effect models were used to compare BG and Pi-Ab levels. The in vitro susceptibility test was performed with all P. insidiosum isolates from culture-positive cases. A total of 50 patients were enrolled: 45 survived and 5 died during follow-up. The survivors had a significantly shorter time to medical care (P 0.0001) and a significantly shorter waiting time to the first surgery (P 0.0001). There were no differences in BG levels among the groups at diagnosis (P 0.33); however, BG levels among survivors were significantly lower than those of the deceased group at 0.5 months (P 0.0001) and became undetectable after 3 months. Survivors were able to maintain an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) value (EV) of Pi-Ab above 8, whereas the EV among deceased patients was less than 4. In vitro susceptibility results revealed no synergistic effects between itraconazole and terbinafine. This study showed that BG and Pi-Ab are potentially valuable markers to monitor the disease after treatment initiation. An unchanged BG level at 2 weeks after surgery should prompt an evaluation for residual disease."
"Effects of donor age, donor sex, blood-component processing, and storage on cell-derived microparticle concentrations in routine blood-component preparation  2018 Elsevier LtdBackground: A number of factors cause increases in the number of cell-derived microparticles (MPs) in blood components. However, the overall effects of these factors on the concentration of MPs during routine blood-component preparation have not fully been elucidated. Aim: To evaluate the effects of donor age, donor sex, blood-component preparation, and storage on MP concentrations. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to quantitate the number of whole blood-derived MPs. Results: The total MP concentration was similar in male and female donors (26,044 ± 1254 particles/μL vs. 27,696 ± 1584 particles/μL). The total MP concentration did not differ significantly among the different age groups: 18–30 years (28,730 ± 1600 particles/μL), 31–40 years (24,972 ± 5947 particles/μL), and 41–58 years (25,195 ± 1727 particles/μL). However, the total number of MPs in fresh plasma (152,110 ± 46,716 particles/μL) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that in unprocessed whole blood (26,752 ± 985 particles/μL), fresh packed red blood cells (PRBCs) (28,574 ± 1028 particles/μL), and platelet concentrate (PC) (33,072 ± 1858 particles/μL). Furthermore, the total numbers of MPs in stored PRBCs and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in fresh PRBCs and fresh plasma, respectively. Conclusions: The study suggests that donor factors, blood-component processing and storage contribute to the MP concentration in routine blood-product preparation. The findings can improve quality control and management of blood-product manufacturing in routine transfusion laboratories."
"Lowered quality of life in mood disorders is associated with increased neuro-oxidative stress and basal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and use of anticonvulsant mood stabilizers  2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Rationale, aims: Major affective disorders including bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are associated with impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Oxidative stress and subtle thyroid abnormalities may play a pathophysiological role in both disorders. Thus, the current study was performed to examine whether neuro-oxidative biomarkers and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels could predict HRQoL in BD and MDD. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 68 BD and 37 MDD patients and 66 healthy controls. The World Health Organization (WHO) QoL-BREF scale was used to assess 4 QoL subdomains. Peripheral blood malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products, paraoxonaxe/CMPAase activity, a composite index of nitro-oxidative stress, and basal TSH were measured. Results: In the total WHOQoL score, 17.3% of the variance was explained by increased advanced oxidation protein products and TSH levels and lowered CMPAase activity and male gender. Physical HRQoL (14.4%) was associated with increased MDA and TSH levels and lowered CMPAase activity. Social relations HRQoL (17.4%) was predicted by higher nitro-oxidative index and TSH values, while mental and environment HRQoL were independently predicted by CMPAase activity. Finally, 73.0% of the variance in total HRQoL was explained by severity of depressive symptoms, use of anticonvulsants, lower income, early lifetime emotional neglect, MDA levels, the presence of mood disorders, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: These data show that lowered HRQoL in major affective disorders could at least in part result from the effects of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, lowered antioxidant enzyme activities, and higher levels of TSH."
"Towards a new classification of stable phase schizophrenia into major and simple neuro-cognitive psychosis: Results of unsupervised machine learning analysis  2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Rationale: Deficit schizophrenia, as defined by the Schedule for Deficit Syndrome, may represent a distinct diagnostic class defined by neurocognitive impairments coupled with changes in IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). Adequate classifications should be based on supervised and unsupervised learning rather than on consensus criteria. Methods: This study used machine learning as means to provide a more accurate classification of patients with stable phase schizophrenia. Results: We found that using negative symptoms as discriminatory variables, schizophrenia patients may be divided into two distinct classes modelled by (A) impairments in IgA/IgM responses to noxious and generally more protective tryptophan catabolites, (B) impairments in episodic and semantic memory, paired associative learning and false memory creation, and (C) psychotic, excitation, hostility, mannerism, negative, and affective symptoms. The first cluster shows increased negative, psychotic, excitation, hostility, mannerism, depression and anxiety symptoms, and more neuroimmune and cognitive disorders and is therefore called “major neurocognitive psychosis” (MNP). The second cluster, called “simple neurocognitive psychosis” (SNP) is discriminated from normal controls by the same features although the impairments are less well developed than in MNP. The latter is additionally externally validated by lowered quality of life, body mass (reflecting a leptosome body type), and education (reflecting lower cognitive reserve). Conclusions: Previous distinctions including “type 1” (positive)/“type 2” (negative) and DSM-IV-TR (eg, paranoid) schizophrenia could not be validated using machine learning techniques. Previous names of the illness, including schizophrenia, are not very adequate because they do not describe the features of the illness, namely, interrelated neuroimmune, cognitive, and clinical features. Stable-phase schizophrenia consists of 2 relevant qualitatively distinct categories or nosological entities with SNP being a less well-developed phenotype, while MNP is the full blown phenotype or core illness. Major neurocognitive psychosis and SNP should be added to the DSM-5 and incorporated into the Research Domain Criteria project."
"Fabrication of a chitin/chitosan hydrocolloid wound dressing and evaluation of its bioactive properties  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The aim of this study was to develop a chitin/chitosan hydrocolloid (CCH) wound dressing. Chitosan was cross-linked with tripolyphosphate to prepare chitosan microbeads and then incorporated within the chitin matrix in a chitosan microbeads:chitin (w/w) ratios of 0.1–0.5:1 to fabricate the CCH hydrogels. As potential wound dressings, the chitin and CCH gels were then evaluated for their water absorption, enzymatic degradation and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and biocompatibility with the L929 cell line. The chitin gel had a water absorption of approximately 231 ± 22% of its dry weight, which was higher in the CCH gels than that prepared from chitosan microbeads:chitin (w/w) in ther ratio of 0.1:1 which had the highest water absorption (308 ± 13% of its dry weight). Both the chitin and CCH hydrogels were gradually surface-degraded by lysozyme (1.4 g/mL), being reduced to 47.5 ± 7.5 and 55.3 ± 2.9% of their wet weight, respectively, after 7 days. The water adsorption, effective antibacterial activity and biocompatibility of the CCH gels suggest their potential for applications in medical fields as wound dressings for wound healing."
"Erectile dysfunction and atrial fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis  2018 The Japanese Urological AssociationObjective: To investigate the pooled incidence or the prevalence of erectile dysfunction, and to assess the risk of erectile dysfunction in patients with atrial fibrillation. Methods: A systematic review was carried out in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from inception through January 2018 to identify: (i) studies that reported the incidence and/or prevalence of erectile dysfunction in atrial fibrillation patients; or (ii) studies that assessed the association between atrial fibrillation and erectile dysfunction. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random effects model. Results: Five observational studies (27 841 patients) were enrolled. The pooled estimated prevalence of erectile dysfunction in atrial fibrillation patients was 57% (95% confidence interval 50–64, I2 = 0). A study showed an incidence of newly diagnosed erectile dysfunction in atrial fibrillation patients of 0.96% during the mean follow-up duration of 4.67 ± 3.20 years. There was a significant association of atrial fibrillation with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction, with a pooled odds ratio of 1.79 (95% confidence interval 1.44–2.23, I2 = 0%). The data on the risk of atrial fibrillation development in patients with erectile dysfunction were limited. A study showed the comparable risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with erectile dysfunction (odds ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.67–1.5), when compared with those without erectile dysfunction. Conclusions: The present study suggests a significant association between erectile dysfunction and atrial fibrillation. The overall estimated prevalence of erectile dysfunction among atrial fibrillation patients is 57%. However, despite limited data, the current evidence suggests a low incidence of new erectile dysfunction in atrial fibrillation patients."
"The patchy tremor landscape: Recent advances in pathophysiology  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Purpose of review We focus on new insights in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease tremor, essential tremor, tremor in dystonia, and orthostatic tremor. Recent findings Neuroimaging findings suggest that Parkinson's disease resting tremor is associated with dopaminergic dysfunction, serotonergic dysfunction, or both. Not all tremors in Parkinson's disease have the same pathophysiology: postural tremor in Parkinson's disease can be subdivided into pure postural tremor, which involves nondopaminergic mechanisms, and re-emergent tremor, which has a dopaminergic basis. Unlike Parkinson's disease tremor, essential tremor has an electrophysiological signature suggestive of a single (or several tightly coupled) oscillators. Visual feedback increases essential tremor and enhances cerebral activity in the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuit, supplementary motor area, and parietal cortex. Little is known about dystonic tremor but the available evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum play a role. Finally, recent work in orthostatic tremor points towards the role of the pontine tegmentum and dysfunctional cerebellar-SMA circuitry. Summary Many pathological tremors involve the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuitry, and the clinical and pathophysiological boundaries between tremor disorders are not always clear. Differences between tremor disorders-or even individual patients-may be explained by the specific balance of neurotransmitter degeneration, by distinct circuit dynamics, or by the role of regions interconnected to the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuit."
"Synergistic study between CaO and MgO sorbents for hydrogen rich gas production from the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves  2018 Institution of Chemical EngineersThis study focused on investigating the sorption-enhanced hydrogen (H2)-rich gas production during the pyrolysis-steam gasification of biomass in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. The mixed CaO/MgO sorbents were employed in order to enhance the H2 production through the water-gas shift reaction associated with the capturing of CO2. The CaO/MgO sorbents prepared by dry- and wet-physical mixing with different molar ratios were examined. In addition, the effect of different devolatilization temperatures (400–800 °C) and gasification temperatures (600–800 °C) on the H2 yield were explored. It was found that the dry-mixed CaO/MgO sorbent exhibited a synergistic effect in the pyrolysis-steam gasification of the biomass, where a CaO:MgO molar ratio of 2:1 gave the highest H2 yield (16.8 mmol/gbiomass) and H2 concentration (75.0%). The wet-mixed sorbent gave superior results, affording a higher H2 yield (21.2 mmol/gbiomass) and H2 concentration (79.8%) with the same CaO: MgO molar ratio of 2:1. The CO2 yield was also reduced to 1.14 mmol/gbiomass compared to that with the dry mixed sorbent (1.72 mmol/gbiomass). The oxygenated compounds mainly derived at the devolatilization temperature of 600 °C were conceivably preferable to the sorption-enhanced hydrogen production in the gasification, leading to the highest yield and concentration of H2. Increasing the gasification temperature above 600 °C provided a higher H2 yield but caused a lower H2 concentration. A comprehensive discussion on these aspects related to volatile components released from different temperatures and reactivity of sorbents is provided."
"A comprehensive person-centered approach to adult spastic paresis: A consensus-based framework  2017 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.Spastic paresis is a common feature of an upper motor neuron impairment caused by stroke, brain injury, multiple sclerosis and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Existing national and international guidelines for the treatment of adult spastic paresis tend to focus on the treatment of muscle overactivity rather than the comprehensive approach to care, which may require life-long management. Person-centered care is increasingly adopted by healthcare systems in a shift of focus from ""disease-oriented"" towards ""person-centered"" medicine. The challenge is to apply this principle to the complex management of spastic paresis and to include an educative process that engages care providers and patients and encourages them to participate actively in the long-term management of their own disease. To address this issue, a group of 13 international clinicians and researchers used a pragmatic top-down methodology to evaluate the evidence and to formulate and grade the strength of recommendations for applying the principles of person-centered care to the management of spastic paresis. There is a distinct lack of clinical trial evidence regarding the application of person-centered medicine to the rehabilitation setting. However, the current evidence base supports the need to ensure that treatment interventions for spastic paresis should be centered on as far as reasonable on the patient's own priorities for treatment. Goal setting, negotiation and formal recording of agreed SMART goals should be an integral part of all spasticity management programs, and goal attainment scaling should be recorded alongside other standardized measures in the evaluation of outcome. When planning interventions for spastic paresis, the team should consider the patient and their family's capacity for self-rehabilitation, as well as ways to enhance this approach. Finally, the proposed intervention and treatment goals should consider the impact of any neuropsychological, cognitive and behavioral deficits on rehabilitation. These recommendations support a person-centric focus in the management of spastic paresis."
"Cadmium Removal from Contaminated Sediment Using EDTA and DTPA with Water Hyacinth  2018, University of Tehran.Chelating agents and pH play a significant role in affecting heavy metal availability contaminated sediment. Water hyacinth was studied for efficiency of cadmium (Cd) uptake using EDTA, DTPA, and a mixture of EDTA/DTPA at various pH values. Experiments were conducted by adding 2 mg/L of EDTA, DTPA, and EDTA/DTPA at pH 4, 5, 7, and 9. Plants were submerged in water containing 80 mg/kg of Cd-contaminated sediment and harvested at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days to measure the Cd concentrations in two parts, including the above-water part (stems and leaves) and underwater part (roots). The results showed that Cd accumulation in the plants with added EDTA and DTPA was higher than that in the control sets, indicating that EDTA and DTPA enhanced Cd uptake by water hyacinth. However, the pH-dependent results with EDTA and DTPA amendment did not significantly differ in terms of Cd uptake. The Cd concentrations in underwater part (roots) with EDTA and DTPA were 62.53 and 61.17 mg/kg, respectively. The above-water part could accumulate Cd at lower levels than the underwater part by a factor of approximately 10 for both EDTA and DTPA. Cd accumulation in the underwater part was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that in the above-water part. For the EDTA/DTPA treatment, the average Cd accumulation in the underwater part (112.73 mg/kg) was higher than that in the above-water part (14.23 mg/kg) at 90 days. The appropriate condition for reducing Cd concentrations in contaminated sediment by the uptake of Cd in water hyacinth is the synergistic mechanism of EDTA/DTPA at pH 5, which provides a Cd-removal capacity from sediment of more than 0.51% within 3 months."
"Effect of Lactobacillus salivarius on growth performance, diarrhea incidence, fecal bacterial population and intestinal morphology of suckling pigs challenged with F4+ enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli  2018 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.Objective: Gut health improvements were monitored with respect to growth performance, diarrhea incidence, fecal bacterial population and intestinal morphology of suckling pigs orally supplemented with live Lactobacillus salivarius (L. salivarius) oral suspensions and challenged with F4+ enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Methods: Two groups of newborn pigs from 18 multiparous sows were randomly designated as non-supplemented (control: n = 114 piglets) and L. salivarius supplemented groups (treatment: n = 87 piglets). Treatment pigs were orally administered with 2 mL of 109 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL L. salivarius on days 1 to 3, then they were orally administered with 5 mL of 109 CFU/mL L. salivarius on days 4 to 10, while those in control group received an equal amount of phosphate buffered saline solution. On day 24 (2 weeks post supplementation), one pig per replicate of both groups was orally administered with 108 CFU/mL F4+ ETEC, then they were euthanized on day 29 of experiment. Results: Results revealed that pigs in treatment group had a statistically significant increase in average daily gain, body weight and weight gain, and tended to lower diarrhea throughout the study. Numbers of Lactobacillus population in feces of treatment pigs were higher than control pigs, especially on day 10 of study. Numbers of total bacteria in intestinal contents of control pigs were also increased, but not Coliform and Lactobacillus populations. Histological examination revealed statistically significant improvements of villous height and villous/crypt ratio of duodenum, proximal jejunum and distal jejunum parts of treatment pigs compared with controls. Duodenal pH of treatment group was significantly decreased. Conclusion: Oral supplementation of live L. salivarius during the first 10 days of suckling pig promoted growth performance and gut health, reduced diarrhea incidence, increased fecal Lactobacillus populations and improved intestinal morphology."
"Poly(acrylic acid) with benzoxazine-based supramolecular crosslinker for responsive and reversible functional hydrogel  2018 Elsevier LtdPoly(acrylic acid) (PAA) is known for the hydrogels for decades. The present work demonstrates an approach to develop responsive and reversible PAA hydrogel by applying the supramolecular crosslinker. N, N′-Bis(3,5-dimethyl-2-hydroxybenzyl) methylamine derivatives, so-called benzoxazine dimers, are good model crosslinkers. In the first step, azobenzene containing benzoxazine monomer (Bzx) with hydroxyl group (–OH) at the terminals to enable the crosslinking with PAA via ester linkages is designed. In the second step, the ring opening of Bzx by using phenols results in the Bzx dimer which its two dimeric packing structure allows the metal ion to be incorporated as guest species. Based on this concept, PAA crosslinked by azobenzene-based Bzx dimer shows the light responsive functional hydrogel via cis-trans conformational change of azobenzene group under UV light and the tunable gel hardness via metallosupramolecular Bzx dimer. The present work shows the simple way to develop the hydrogel with tunable properties based on the supramolecular crosslinkers."
"Social capital, outpatient care utilization and choice between different levels of health facilities in rural and urban areas of Bhutan  2018 Elsevier LtdThis study examines the factors that explain outpatient care utilization and the choice between different levels of health facilities in Bhutan, focusing on individual social capital, given Bhutan's geography of remote and sparsely populated areas. The more isolated the living, the more important individual social capital may become. Standard factors proposed by the Andersen model of healthcare utilization serve as control variables. Data for 2526 households from the 2012 Bhutan Living Standards Survey, which contains a social capital module covering structural, cognitive and output dimensions of social capital, are used. The results from the logistic regression analysis show that individual social capital is positively related with the probability of seeking treatment when ill or injured. Informal social contacts and perceived help and support are most important in rural areas, whereas specific trust matters in urban areas. The explanatory power of the model using a subset of the data for urban areas only, however, is very low as most predisposing and enabling factors are insignificant, which is not surprising though in view of better access to health facilities in urban areas and the fact that healthcare is provided free of charge in Bhutan. Multinomial regression results further show that structural and output dimensions of social capital influence the likelihood of seeking care at secondary or tertiary care facilities relative to primary care facilities. Moreover, economic status and place of residence are significantly associated with healthcare utilization and choice of health facility. The findings with respect to social capital suggest that strategizing and organizing social capital may help improve healthcare utilization in Bhutan."
"Modified Robert Jones bandage can not reduce invisible blood loss after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized-controlled trial  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Introduction: To compare the efficacy and safety of modified Robert Jones bandage (MRJB) and non-compressive dressing (NCD) on reducing invisible blood loss (IBL) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Materials and methods: Eighty patients who underwent unilateral TKA were randomly assigned into two groups: MRJB and NCD groups. Pre- and post-operative hematocrit levels, amount of drained blood and transfused blood were measured and calculated into IBL. Pain score, amount of morphine usage, range of motion (ROM) at discharge, blood transfusion rate, and complications were also recorded and compared between both groups. Results: There was no significant difference in the mean IBL between MRJB (221.2 ± 233.3 ml) and NCD groups (158.5 ± 186.7 ml) (p = 0.219). Post-operative pain score at rest and during ambulation, amount of morphine usage, ROM at discharge, blood transfusion rate, and complications were also similar between two groups. Conclusions: This study cannot determine the benefit of MRJB over NCD. The use of MRJB may not be necessary after primary TKA."
"Auditors’ going concern reporting accuracy during and after the global financial crisis  2018 Elsevier LtdMotivated by concerns that one of the reasons for the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) is poor quality auditing, this study examines the accuracy of going concern modifications for a sample of United States (U.S.) companies in the pre-GFC (2005–2006), GFC (2007–2008), and post-GFC (2009–2010) periods. The results show that the type I misclassification is lower during the GFC but not different in the post-GFC period compared with the pre-GFC period. The type II misclassification is not significantly different in the GFC and post-GFC periods compared with the pre-GFC period. Additionally, the results suggest that non-Big 4 auditors, compared with Big 4 auditors, have become more conservative on clients’ going concern problems in the post-GFC period, which reduces their type II misclassification."
"Late Middle Pleistocene ecology and climate in Northeastern Thailand inferred from the stable isotope analysis of Khok Sung herbivore tooth enamel and the land mammal cenogram  2018Paleoecological and paleoclimatic records based on the stable isotopes of mammalian tooth enamel are poorly known in mainland Southeast Asia during the Pleistocene. Khok Sung in Northeastern Thailand is a late Middle Pleistocene terrace deposit, tentatively dated either as 213 ka or 188 ka, yielding 15 described mammalian taxa with especially abundant and complete fossil remains. To investigate paleodiets and habitats of these ancient mammals and to understand the corresponding regional climate, we performed an analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes extracted from tooth enamel carbonate of various mammalian taxa, coupled with the cenogram method. The enamel δ13C values of Khok Sung mammals indicate a variety of diets, ranging from pure C3 to C4 plants, suggesting that C4 grasses were a major component of local Thai ecosystems during the late Middle Pleistocene. The stable isotopic distinction between C3 and C4 plants suggests that the Pleistocene wildlife habitats ranged from closed forests to open grasslands for the Khok Sung area. Moreover, differences within sympatric Pleistocene herbivores such as proboscideans, rhinoceroses, and cervids characterize possible niche partitioning by minimizing interspecific overlap. Paleoclimatic interpretations based on the intra-tooth variability in enamel δ18O values from large mammals and on the cenogram analysis reflect significant seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature, and humid conditions, for the Khok Sung locality. Compared to modern environments in Thailand, it is apparent that C4-dominated grasslands were more widespread at that time when anthropic impacts on the ecosystems were presumably absent or minimal."
"Potential microbial consortium involved in the biodegradation of diesel, hexadecane and phenanthrene in mangrove sediment explored by metagenomics analysis  2018 Elsevier LtdHydrocarbon contamination is a serious problem that degrades the quality of mangrove ecosystems, and bioremediation using autochthonous bacteria is a promising technology to recover an impacted environment. This research investigates the biodegradation rates of diesel, hexadecane and phenanthrene, by conducting a microcosm study and survey of the autochthonous microbial community in contaminated mangrove sediment, using an Illumina MiSeq platform. The biodegradation rates of diesel, hexadecane and phenanthrene were 82, 86 and 8 mg kg−1 sediment day−1, respectively. The removal efficiencies of hexadecane and phenanthrene were >99%, whereas the removal efficiency of diesel was 88%. A 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis revealed that the major bacterial assemblages detected were Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria. The bacterial compositions were relatively constant, while reductions of the supplemented hydrocarbons were observed. The results imply that the autochthonous microorganisms in the mangrove sediment were responsible for the degradation of the respective hydrocarbons. Diesel-, hexadecane- and phenanthrene-degrading bacteria, namely Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp. and Staphylococcus sp., were also isolated from the mangrove sediment. The mangrove sediment provides a potential resource of effective hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria that can be used as an inoculum or further developed as a ready-to-use microbial consortium for the purpose of bioremediation."
"Normative Database and Color-code Agreement of Peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer and Macular Ganglion Cell-inner Plexiform Layer Thickness in a Vietnamese Population Copyright  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Purpose: Evaluate the distribution and the color probability codes of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness in a healthy Vietnamese population and compare them with the original color-codes provided by the Cirrus spectral domain-optical coherence tomography. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. We recruited nonglaucomatous Vietnamese subjects and constructed a normative database for peripapillary RNFL and macular GCIPL thickness. The probability color-codes for each decade of age were calculated. We evaluated the agreement with κ coefficient between optical coherence tomography color probability codes with Cirrus built-in original normative database and the Vietnamese normative database. Results: In total, 149 eyes of 149 subjects were included. The mean age of enrollees was 60.77 (±11.09) years, with a mean spherical equivalent of +0.65 (±1.58) D and mean axial length of 23.4 (±0.87) mm. Average RNFL thickness was 97.86 (±9.19) μm and average macular GCIPL was 82.49 (±6.09) μm. Agreement between original and adjusted normative database for RNFL was fair for average and inferior quadrant (κ=0.25 and 0.2, respectively); and good for other quadrants (range, κ=0.63 to 0.73). For macular GCIPL κ agreement ranged between 0.39 and 0.69. After adjusting with the normative Vietnamese database, the percent of yellow and red color-codes increased significantly for peripapillary RNFL thickness. Conclusions: Vietnamese population has a thicker RNFL in comparison with Cirrus normative database. This leads to a poor color-code agreement in average and inferior quadrant between the original and adjusted database. These findings should encourage to create a peripapillary RNFL normative database for each ethnicity."
"Subcutaneous infiltration of carbon dioxide (carboxytherapy) for abdominal fat reduction: A randomized clinical trial  2018 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.Background: Noninvasive fat removal is preferred because of decreased downtime and lower perceived risk. It is important to seek new noninvasive fat removal treatments that are both safe and efficacious. Objective: To assess the extent to which carboxytherapy, which is the insufflation of carbon dioxide gas into subcutaneous fat, results in reduction of fat volume. Methods: In this randomized, sham-controlled, split-body study, adults (body mass index, 22-29 kg/m2) were randomized to receive 5 weekly infusions of 1000 cm3 of CO2 to 1 side of the abdomen, and 5 sham treatments to the contralateral side. The primary outcome measures were ultrasound measurement of fat layer thickness and total circumference before and after treatment. Results: A total of 16 participants completed the study. Ultrasound measurement indicated less fat volume on the side treated with carboxytherapy 1 week after the last treatment (P =.011), but the lower fat volume was not maintained at 28 weeks. Total circumference decreased nominally but not significantly at week 5 compared with baseline (P =.0697). Participant body weights did not change over the entire course of the study (P = 1.00). Limitations: Limitations included modest sample size and some sources of error in the measurement of circumference and fat layer. Conclusion: Carboxytherapy provides a transient decrease in subcutaneous fat that may not persist. Treatment is well tolerated."
"The protective effect of some Thai plants and their bioactive compounds in UV light-induced skin carcinogenesis  2018 Elsevier B.V.Skin cancer, represents a major public health concern. While the vast majority is non-melanoma skin cancers, melanomas are mostly responsible for mortality. Solar UVB radiation is mutagenic and carcinogenic. It is primarily responsible for both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers via excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which mediate changes in inflammation and immunity, and have been implicated in all three stages of skin cancer development. Due to their regulatory role in numerous functions of cells, signaling pathways are targets for chemoprevention. The current standards in melanoma therapy are targeted and combination therapies, which, albeit prolong survival responses, are still prone to development of drug resistance. To this extent, drugs of natural origin continue to spark great interest. Thailand has a rich biodiversity of indigenous flora, which have traditionally been used to treat a variety of pathologies. The active components in plant extracts that have medicinal properties, termed ‘bioactive compounds,’ are efficient chemopreventive agents due to their antioxidant, antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, and carcinogen detoxification properties. Thai plants and their bioactive compounds have shown protective effects on UV light-induced skin cancer in different experimental models. This warrants further in vivo investigations and translation to clinical studies to determine efficacy and safety, for use as lead compounds in targeted/combination therapy or adjuvant therapy with existing regimes. Coupled with a strategy for prevention, this offers a promising outlook for protection against photocarcinogenesis."
"Prevalence and genotypic diversity of Entamoeba species in inhabitants in Kathmandu, Nepal  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In Nepal, gastrointestinal infections due to parasites including Entamoeba species are common. The main aim of this study was to identify species of Entamoeba using genotypic analysis. The prevalence of Entamoeba infections was examined by PCR in fecal samples from 143 inhabitants living close to wild rhesus macaques in Kathmandu, Nepal. The numbers of positive cases were one (0.7%) for E. histolytica, eight (5.6%) for E. dispar, seven (4.9%) for E. coli, and two (1.4%) for E. chattoni (E. polecki ST2). No infections with E. nuttalli, E. moshkovskii, and E. polecki ST1 were found. In E. dispar, at least seven different genotypes were detected from the eight samples by sequence analysis of tRNA-linked short tandem repeats. Different genotypes were found even in a couple from the same family. This is the first report demonstrating that E. dispar with high genotypic diversity is prevalent, rather than E. histolytica, in Kathmandu, and that zoonotic transmission of E. chattoni from rhesus macaques might occur in the inhabitants."
"Preparation of mangosteen extract-loaded poly(vinyl acetate) for use as an antibacterial spray-on dressing  2018In this study, we developed a poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) spray-on film containing mangosteen extract (MG/PVAc film) as a bioactive wound dressing. The 2% w/v of PVAc film was prepared by dissolution with ethyl acetate: ethanol: propanol in a ratio of 30:50:20. On this basis, mangosteen extract at 1%, 2% and 3% w/v was selected for further inclusion in a PVAc film, with good antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, the measurement of drug release from the MG/PVAc film, antibacterial activity, and in vitro biocompatibility was assessed in L929 mouse fibroblasts, keratinocyte (HaCat) cells and normal human fibroblasts (NHFs). The cumulative release of mangosteen extract was found to be 30.30–48.80% of the total load after 60 h in an acetate buffer solution and 41.13–49.96% in a phosphate buffer solution. A higher concentration of mangosteen extract added into the PVAc film led to a greater drug release. The combination of mangosteen extract (MG) was shown to improve the antimicrobial efficacy compared to that of the control. The cytotoxicity evaluation showed that the MG/PVAc films did not interfere with the cells and were non-cytotoxic. Based on our results, we suggest that a MG/PVAc film spray can serve as an antibacterial wound dressing."
"Structural stabilities of calcium proteins: Human intelectin-1 and frog lectin XEEL  2018 Elsevier Inc.We extend our study of the structural stability of helical and nonhelical regions in chain A of human intelectin-1 to include a second human intelectin (4WMY) and the frog protein “Xenopus embryonic epidermal lectin” (XEEL). These unique lectins have been shown to recognize carbohydrate residues found exclusively in microbes, thus they could potentially be developed into novel microbe detection and sequestration tools. We believe that by studying the structural stability of these proteins we can provide insights on their biological role and activities. Using a geometrical model introduced previously, we perform computational analyses of protein crystal structures that quantify the resiliency of the native state to steric perturbations. Based on these analyses, we conclude that differences in the resiliency of the human and frog proteins can be attributed primarily to differences in non-helical regions and to residues near Ca ions. Since these differences are particularly pronounced in the vicinity of the ligand binding site, they provide an explanation for the finding that human intelectin-1 has a higher affinity for a ligand than XEEL. We also present data on conserved and position-equivalent pairs of residues in 4WMY and XEEL. We identify residue pairs as well as regions in which the influence of neighboring residues is nearly uniform as the parent protein denatures. Since the structural signatures are conserved, this identification provides a basis for understanding why both proteins exhibit trimeric structures despite poor sequence conservation at the interface."
"Samaria-doped ceria nanopowders for heavy metal removal from aqueous solution  2018 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the feasibility and performance of samaria-doped ceria nanopowder (SDC) as an absorbent for Pb(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) removal from synthetic wastewater is investigated in batch studies. Two commercial SDC nanopowders; SDC-I and SDC-F, are comparatively studied their morphology, crystal structure, specific surface area and pore volume in order to distinguish the effect of above features on the adsorption capability for metal-ion removal. The spherical SDC-F nanopowder is more effective for removal those three metals than SDC-I nanopowders having a cluster plate-like structure. Among those three metal ions, Pb(II) shows the highest sorption amount on the SDC-F surface. The adsorption parameters for Pb(II) on SDC-F are optimized via variable pH values, metal-ion concentrations, adsorbent dosages, temperatures and contact times. Adsorption capacity of Pb(II) on SDC-F nanopowder is maximum at pH = 5.6. Higher removal ability is found at lower metal-ion concentration but higher adsorbent dosage, temperature and contact time. Kinetic studies reveal that the adsorption of Pb(II) on SDC-F nanopowder follows the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity of SDC-F for Pb(II) ions calculated by Langmuir isotherm is 23 mg g−1. Adsorption of Pb(II) on SDC-F is confined by the agglomeration of spherical nanoparticles. The outcome of this study shows that the SDC-F nanoparticles is possible candidate for removal of Pb(II) ions from wastewater."
"Preparation of magnetic hierarchical porous carbon spheres with graphitic features for high methyl orange adsorption capacity  2018 Elsevier LtdThis report describes the successful use of a template-free method in a microemulsion system for the preparation of magnetic hierarchical porous carbon (MHPC) spheres, which possess high adsorption capability for methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution, easy separability from water by magnetic force after the MO removal, and reusability that allowed MO to be adsorbed several times. MHPC spheres are produced by water-in-oil emulsification coupled with sol-gel polymerization of resorcinol containing Fe(NO3)3 and formaldehyde to make spherical carbon precursors with a macroporous framework inside, followed by carbonization with N2 or CO2 activation to transform them into MHPC spheres. Carbonization at temperatures higher than 800 °C resulted in not only graphitic feature formation, but also both micro- and mesopores in the macroporous framework. Moreover, CO2 activation at 900 °C both remarkably enhanced the graphitic features and increased the mesopore volume to 2.16 cm3/g. The magnetic property could be developed by both carbonization and CO2 activation at 900 °C. MHPC spheres obtained from CO2 activation developed tremendous adsorption capacities, as high as 1522.6 mg/g under neutral conditions, which were suitable to be reused for MO removal for at least four consecutive cycles without efficiency loss."
"Control of parturition in swine using PGF2α in combination with carbetocin  2018 Elsevier B.V.Carbetocin is an oxytocin-like molecule with long-acting properties. The present study determined the efficacy of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2α) combined with carbetocin compared to PGF2α alone for the induction of parturition. A total of 2395 piglets born from 183 sows were included. Sows were randomly allocated into three groups: (1) control group (n = 80): sows farrowed naturally; (2) PGF group (n = 50): farrowing induced using PGF2α; and (3) carbetocin group (n = 53): farrowing induced using PGF2α and carbetocin. At day 114 of gestation, sows in the PGF and carbetocin groups were administered 2 ml of a PGF2α analogue. After 24 h, sows in the carbetocin group were injected with 0.6 µg/kg of carbetocin. Animals were monitored during the farrowing process. Farrowing duration, birth interval, rectal temperature and birth weight of the piglets were recorded. Colostrum intake of the piglets and colostrum yield of sows were estimated. The farrowing duration (274 ± 209 min) and birth interval (20.7 ± 55.8 min) did not differ among groups (P > 0.05). The percentage of sows that farrowed during working hours (0700 to 1700 h) were 51.3%, 70.0% and 98.1% in the control, PGF and carbetocin groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The proportion of stillborn piglets was 6.1%, 4.0% and 4.7% in the control, PGF and carbetocin groups, respectively (P > 0.05). The colostrum yield of sows in the carbetocin group (4050 ± 207 g) was lower than the control (4836 ± 148 g) and PGF (4896 ± 229 g) groups (P < 0.05). Farrowing induction using PGF2α in combination with carbetocin successfully concentrated farrowings during working hours but reduced colostrum intake of the piglets. Thus, it should be performed along with proper neonatal care."
"Physicochemical, antioxidant and sensory characteristics of sponge cakes fortified with Clitoria ternatea extract  2018, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).Bakery products are a food appreciated by consumers all over the world. There is a great opportunity to incorporate more bioactive compounds to enhance its quality. The objective of this study was to utilize the advantage of CTE in the production of sponge cake. The five different levels of CTE (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%, w/w) was incorporated into sponge cake. The sponge cakes were evaluated for physicochemical (color, volume, water activity, total phenolic content, and antioxidant properties) and texture characteristics as well as consumer acceptance. Addition of CTE into the sponge cakes increased the polyphenol content and antioxidant activity concomitant with reduced lipid peroxidation. Increasing hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness and decreasing cohesiveness, springiness and resilience of cakes were seen when increasing percentage of CTE in the cake. A significant decrease was observed in the lightness, redness and yellowness in the cake containing CTE. No differences were found in overall acceptability between the control and the cake containing CTE. The findings suggest that CTE could be a potential source for development of sponge cakes with more effective antioxidant properties."
"Insights into the Li+ storage mechanism of TiC@C-TiO2 core-shell nanostructures as high performance anodes  2018 Elsevier LtdTitanium carbide @ carbon-doped titanium dioxide (TiC@C-TiO2) core-shell nanostructures are designed, prepared and demonstrated for the application in lithium ion battery anode. Synthesis of these specific core-shell nanostructures is achieved via a facile, novel, and one-pot approach using oxidative growth of C-TiO2 onto TiC nanoparticles, which has a higher electrochemical activity than those of pure P25 and TiC nanoparticles. The core-shell nanostructured anodes exhibit a high lithium storage capacity (352.8 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1), good rate capability (253.6 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, 158.1 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1), and outstanding cycle stability in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) (~ 150 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 400 cycles), which is about 48 times and 7 times higher than that of TiO2 electrode (~ 3.3 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and TiC (~ 25 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1). According to the first-principle calculation, the ultrahigh capacity and cycle stability of the as-prepared anode is ascribed to the enhancement of Li+ absorption and diffusion ability through formation of C-TiO2 porous layer onto the conductive TiC particles. Moreover, the increase of electron density around the Fermi level is found to be mainly caused by the core-shell nanostructures. The results demonstrate that the presence of TiC plays an important role in providing high conductivity and the novel core-shell nanostructure can buffer the huge volume expansion and contraction during prolonged cycling, resulting in great potential applications in LIBs."
"Silencing of a Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor SPIPm2 from Penaeus monodon affects YHV susceptibility and hemocyte homeostasis  2018In shrimp, the Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitors (KPIs) are involved in host innate immune defense system against pathogenic microorganisms. A five-Kazal-domain SPIPm2 is the most abundant KPIs in the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon and up-regulated in response to yellow head virus (YHV) infection. In this study, the role of SPIPm2 in YHV infection was investigated. The expression of SPIPm2 in hemocytes, gill and heart from 48-h YHV-infected shrimp was increased. The expression of SPIPm2 in hemocytes was significantly increased after 12 h of infection and gradually increased higher afterwards. Silencing of SPIPm2 by dsRNA interference resulted in the increased expression of different apoptosis-related genes, the increased expression of transcriptional factors of antimicrobial synthesis pathways, the reduction of circulating hemocytes in the shrimp hemolymph, and the increased susceptibility of the silenced shrimp to YHV infection. The activities of caspase-3 and caspase-7 in the hemocytes of SPIPm2-silenced shrimp was also increased by 5.32-fold as compared with those of the control shrimp. The results suggested that the SPIPm2 was involved in the hemocyte homeostasis."
"Erythrosaponins A–J, triterpene saponins from the roots and stem bark of Gardenia erythroclada  2018 Elsevier LtdTen undescribed triterpene saponins, named erythrosaponins A–J, along with one known analogue were isolated from the roots and stem bark of Gardenia erythroclada. Their structures were determined on the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR analyses. Absolute structure of erythrosaponin A was unequivocally affirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines (KB and HeLa S-3) and their anti-inflammatory activity based on the inhibition of NO production in RAW264.7 cells. Erythrosaponin D showed moderate cytotoxicity against KB and HeLa S-3 cells with IC50 values of 25.8 and 29.5 μM, respectively. Erythrosaponins D, F, G, I and J showed moderate anti-inflammatory with IC50 values in the range of 63.0–81.4 μM."

"In-line carbon nanofiber reinforced hollow fiber-mediated liquid phase microextraction using a 3D printed extraction platform as a front end to liquid chromatography for automatic sample preparation and analysis: A proof of concept study  2018 Elsevier B.V.A novel concept for automation of nanostructured hollow-fiber supported microextraction, combining the principles of liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) and sorbent microextraction synergically, using mesofluidic platforms is proposed herein for the first time, and demonstrated with the determination of acidic drugs (namely, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen) in urine as a proof-of-concept applicability. Dispersed carbon nanofibers (CNF) are immobilized in the pores of a single-stranded polypropylene hollow fiber (CNF@HF) membrane, which is thereafter accommodated in a stereolithographic 3D-printed extraction chamber without glued components for ease of assembly. The analytical method involves continuous-flow extraction of the acidic drugs from a flowing stream donor (pH 1.7) into an alkaline stagnant acceptor (20 mmol L−1 NaOH) containing 10% MeOH (v/v) across a dihexyl ether impregnated CNF@HF membrane. The flow setup features entire automation of the microextraction process including regeneration of the organic film and on-line injection of the analyte-laden acceptor phase after downstream neutralization into a liquid chromatograph (LC) for reversed-phase core-shell column-based separation. Using a 12-cm long CNF@HF and a sample volume of 6.4 mL, linear dynamic ranges of ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen, taken as models of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, spanned from ca. 5–15 µg L−1 to 500 µg L−1 with enhancement factors of 43–97 (against a direct injection of 10 µL standards into LC), and limits of detection from 1.6 to 4.3 µg L−1. Relative recoveries in real urine samples ranged from 97% to 105%, thus demonstrating the reliability of the automatic CNF@HF-LPME method for in-line matrix clean-up and determination of drugs in urine at therapeutically relevant concentrations."
"The prevalence of molecular markers of drug resistance in Plasmodium vivax from the border regions of Thailand in 2008 and 2014  2018 The AuthorsThe prevalence of Plasmodium vivax is increasing in the border regions of Thailand; one potential problem confounding the control of malaria in these regions is the emergence and spread of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity in genes potentially linked to drug resistance in P. vivax parasites isolated from four different border regions of Thailand; Thai-Myanmar (Tak, Mae Hong Son and Prachuap Khiri Khan Provinces), and Thai-Cambodian borders (Chanthaburi Province). Isolates were collected from 345 P. vivax patients in 2008 and 2014, and parasite DNA extracted and subjected to nucleotide sequencing at five putative drug-resistance loci (Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1, Pvcrt-o and Pvk12). The prevalence of mutations in Pvdhfr, Pvdhps and Pvmdr1 were markedly different between the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodian border areas and also varied between sampling times. All isolates carried the Pvdhfr (58R and 117N/T) mutation, however, whereas the quadruple mutant allele (I57R58M61T117) was the most prevalent (69.6%) in the Thai-Myanmar border region, the double mutant allele (F57R58T61N117) was at fixation on the Thai-Cambodian border (100%). The most prevalent genotypes of Pvdhps and Pvmdr1 were the double mutant (S382G383K512G553) (65.1%) and single mutant (M958Y976F1076) (46.5%) alleles, respectively on the Thai-Myanmar border while the single Pvdhps mutant (S382G383K512A553) (52.7%) and the triple Pvmdr1 mutant (M958F976L1076) (81%) alleles were dominant on the Thai-Cambodian border. No mutations were observed in the Pvcrt-o gene in either region. Novel mutations in the Pvk12 gene, the P. vivax orthologue of PfK13, linked to artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, were observed with three nonsynonymous and three synonymous mutations in six isolates (3.3%)."
"Vertical vibrations of rigid foundations of arbitrary shape in a multi-layered poroelastic medium  2018 Elsevier LtdThis paper presents dynamic response of rigid foundations of arbitrary shape embedded in a multi-layered poroelastic medium subjected to time-harmonic vertical loading. The contact surface between foundation and poroelastic medium is smooth, and either permeable or impermeable. This dynamic interaction problem is investigated by employing a discretization technique and an exact stiffness matrix scheme. Selected numerical results are shown to portray the influence of various parameters such as foundation shape, embedded depth, and poroelastic effects on vertical compliances of various rigid foundations in multi-layered poroelastic media. In addition, vertical vibrations of mudmat foundations on water-saturated layered soils are also presented."
"Gold Nanoparticle-labeled Electrochemical Immunoassay Using Open Circuit Potential for Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Detection  2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThis study presents a new approach for an electrochemical immunoassay using gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-labeled antibodies and pre-oxidation and reduction processes, followed by open circuit potential (OCP) measurement. Detection of the pregnancy marker, human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG), was used as a model. After preparation of a sandwich-type immunosystem, the pre-oxidation and reduction processes were applied, followed by OCP detection. The applied potential and time period were studied for the optimization of pre-oxidation and reduction processes. We observed that the pre-oxidation potential of 1.2 V for 60 s and reduction potential of −0.2 V for 30 s provided the highest OCP signal. The detection limit was 79 pg/mL using the optimal conditions. This system could be applied to a simplified and miniaturized diagnostic system for integration in compact analytical devices."
"Current practice of diagnosis and management of acute kidney injury in intensive care unit in resource limited settings  2018 Elsevier Inc.Purpose: In a resource limited settings, there is sparse information about the management of acute kidney injury (AKI) based on systemic data collection. This survey aimed to described the current management of AKI in intensive care units (ICUs) across Thailand. Materials and methods: Questionnaires were distributed to 160 physicians involved in the intensive care between January and December 2014 across Thailand. Distribution was done through an online survey platform or telephone interview. Results: The response rate was 80.6% (129 physicians). AKI diagnosis was mostly made by using KDIGO criteria (36.7%). A common diagnostic investigation of AKI was urinalysis (86%). Nephrologists had a major role (86.4%) in deciding the initiation and selection of renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality. Intermittent hemodialysis is the preferable mode of RRT (72.0%), followed by continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT, 12%), sustained low efficiency dialysis (10.0%) and peritoneal dialysis (6.0%). Catheter insertion was predominantly performed by nephrologist (51.1%) with ultrasound guidance. The right internal jugular vein was the most common site of insertion (70.4%). The most common indication for CRRT was hemodynamic instability. Conclusions: Amid increasing concern of AKI in the ICU, our study provides the insight into the management of AKI in resource limited settings."
"Caryophyllene oxide extraction from lemon basil (Ocimum citriodorum Vis.) straw by hydrodistillation and supercritical CO2  2018Every kilogram of the harvested lemon basil (Ocimum citriodorum Vis.) seed generates 1–1.5 kg of basil straw, which is commonly left in the field or burned in the open field. To valorize this straw, the production of caryophyllene oxide from basil straw by hydrodistillation, n-hexane, and supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) extraction was studied. Caryophyllene oxide offers significant anticancer properties. The maximum extracted yields from basil straw by hydrodistillation, n-hexane, and SCCO2 extraction were 0.07% ± 0.01%, 4.11% ± 0.25%, and 1.21% ± 0.09% (w/w), respectively. The CO2 consumption of crude extracted was 16.47 kg-CO2/g extracts at 60 °C and 30.0 MPa. Other bioactive compounds, such as linalool, neral, and geranial are co-extracted."
"Dipentylammonium Binds to the Sigma-1 Receptor and Protects Against Glutamate Toxicity, Attenuates Dopamine Toxicity and Potentiates Neurite Outgrowth in Various Cultured Cell Lines  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects 44 million people worldwide, costing the world $605 billion to care for those affected not taking into account the physical and psychological costs for those who care for Alzheimer’s patients. Dipentylammonium is a simple amine, which is structurally similar to a number of other identified sigma-1 receptor ligands with high affinities such as (2R-trans)-2butyl-5-heptylpyrrolidine, stearylamine and dodecylamine. This study investigates whether dipentylammonium is able to provide neuroprotective effects similar to those of sigma-1 receptor agonists such as PRE-084. Here we identify dipentylammonium as a sigma-1 receptor ligand with nanomolar affinity. We have found that micromolar concentrations of dipentylammonium protect from glutamate toxicity and prevent NFκB activation in HT-22 cells. Micromolar concentrations of dipentylammonium also protect stably expressing amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutant (APP/Swe) Neuro2A cells from toxicity induced by 150 μM dopamine, suggesting that dipentylammonium may be useful for the treatment of Parkinsonian symptoms in Alzheimer’s patients which are often associated with a more rapid deterioration of cognitive and physical ability. Finally, we found that low micromolar concentrations of dipentylammonium could out preform known sigma-1 receptor agonist PRE-084 in potentiating neurite outgrowth in Neuro2A cells, further suggesting that dipentylammonium has a potential use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and could be acting through the sigma-1 receptor."
"In major affective disorders, early life trauma predict increased nitro-oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation and recurrence of major affective disorders, suicidal behaviors and a lowered quality of life  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Early life trauma (ELT) may increase the risk towards bipolar disorder (BD) and major depression (MDD), disorders associated with activated neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative stress (O&NS) pathways. It has remained elusive whether ELTs are associated with O&NS and which ELTs are associated with distinct affective disorder phenotypes. This case-control study examined patients with BD (n = 68) and MDD (n = 37) and healthy controls (n = 66). The Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to assess specific ELT. We measured malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP); NO metabolites (NOx), paraoxonase 1 activity, zinc, albumin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and -SH groups and computed z-unit weighted composite scores. Physical neglect significantly predicts higher z-unit weighted composite scores of LOOH+SOD, LOOH+SOD+NOx, LOOH+SOD+NOx + MDA and LOOH+SOD+NOx + AOPP. Sexual abuse was associated with a significantly lower composite score of zinc+albumin+SH. Emotional abuse was associated with severity of depression and anxiety, number of depressive and manic episodes, alcohol and hypnotics use, lifetime suicidal behavior and lowered quality of life. Sexual abuse was associated with an increased risk towards BD, but not MDD. ELT, especially physical neglect, may drive increased (nitro-)oxidative stress coupled with lipid and protein oxidation, which - together with emotional abuse - may play a role in severity of illness, lowered quality of life and MDD. ELTs are also associated with the onset of BD, but this link did not appear to be related to activated O&NS pathways. These novel findings deserve confirmation in prospective studies."
"Deficit schizophrenia is a discrete diagnostic category defined by neuro-immune and neurocognitive features: results of supervised machine learning  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by neurocognitive impairments and changes in the patterning of IgA/IgM responses to plasma tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). In the current study, supervised pattern recognition methods, including logistic regression analysis (LRA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA), were used to examine whether deficit schizophrenia is a discrete diagnostic class with respect to Consortium To Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) tests and IgA/IgM responses to noxious (NOX) and generally more protective (PRO) TRYCATs. We recruited patients with (n = 40) and without (n = 40) deficit schizophrenia and healthy volunteers (n = 40). The combined use of TRYCAT and CERAD features strongly segregates deficit from nondeficit schizophrenia and healthy controls. Three out of the top five most important features in LRA, SVM and SIMCA agreed, namely two different NOX/PRO TRYCAT ratios and false memory recall. SIMCA shows that deficit schizophrenia is significantly separated from nondeficit schizophrenia and controls with as top 6 features IgA responses to picolinic acid, IgM responses to 3-OH-kynurenine and kynurenic acid, and impairments in Word List Memory and Verbal Fluency Tests and Mini-Mental State Examination. Nevertheless, nondeficit schizophrenia was not significantly separated from controls. The results show that schizophrenia is not a unitary disease with mere continuous differences in severity of illness between apparent subtypes. Deficit schizophrenia is a qualitatively distinct class defined by neuroimmune (autoimmune responses to TRYCATs) and neurocognitive (episodic and semantic memory) features coupled or not with clinical (negative) symptoms."
"Paediatric oral pathology in Thailand: a 15-year retrospective review from a medical teaching hospital  2018 FDI World Dental FederationObjectives: To determine whether the spectrum of oral pathology in children seen at a medical institution differs from studies derived from dental facilities. Methods: Oral biopsy records from paediatric patients (<16 years of age) were retrieved from the pathology archives at Chulalongkorn University Hospital over a period of 15 years. Lesions were categorised as inflammatory/reactive, tumour/tumour-like or cystic. Results: Two-hundred and thirty biopsies were identified. Most lesions were inflammatory/reactive (62%), followed by tumour/tumour-like (35%) and cystic (3%). The largest proportion of lesions was found in the 12–16 years’ age group. Mucocele was the most common lesion (38%), followed by hemangioma (8.3%), irritation fibroma (6%) and nevus (6%). The predominance of mucocele is similar to that in reports from other countries. The proportion of malignant tumours (5%) was higher than in other studies (<1–2%). In contrast, odontogenic cysts and odontogenic tumours were rare (3% and <1%, respectively), compared with published studies (7–35% and 2–21%, respectively). Conclusions: This study from a medical institution shows a somewhat different spectrum of paediatric oral pathology compared with that reported from dental institutions. While some of the lesions may not be treated by dentists, they still need to be aware of these lesions because affected patients can still present initially to a dentist."
"In Thai Nationals, the ApoE4 Allele Affects Multiple Domains of Neuropsychological, Biobehavioral, and Social Functioning Thereby Contributing to Alzheimer’s Disorder, while the ApoE3 Allele Protects Against Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Psychosocial Deficits  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (ApoE4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disorder (AD) and is associated with semantic and episodic memory deficits. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between ApoE alleles (E2, E3, E4) and genotypes and neuropsychological tests, behavioral functions, and dementia symptoms as assessed using Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD). This study included 60 patients with Alzheimer’s disorder (AD), 60 with mild cognitive disorder (MCI), and 62 normal volunteers. ApoE4 carriers and individuals with E3/E4 and E4/E4 genotypes show an increased incidence of AD, but not MCI. ApoE4 carriers and especially E4/E4 homozygotes show a worse outcome on the CERAD total score, Blessed Dementia Scale, and Short Blessed Test and lower scores on the Verbal Fluency Test, Boston Naming Test, Constructional Praxis Recall, and Word List Memory, Recall, and Recognition. ApoE4 carriers and E4/E3 heterozygotes show higher scores on the Clock Drawing Test. ApoE4 carriers show a worse outcome on the CERAD clinical history scores of memory, language, personality, ADL, orientation, and social skills, while allele AopE3 carriers show better scores on activities of daily living (ADL) and social skills. ApoE3 carriers show lower total weighted, irritability/aggression, and behavioral dysregulation scores on the Behavior Rating Scale for Dementia. The results show that in Thai individuals, the presence of ApoE4 allele is accompanied by a multifarious decline in neurocognitive functions and behavioral features and that ApoE3 may convey protection against neuropsychiatric symptoms and a decline in social skills. ApoE4 and especially the E4/E4 genotype may affect multiple domains of cognitive, biobehavioral, and social functioning thereby contributing to AD phenomenology."
"Multiple Immune-Inflammatory and Oxidative and Nitrosative Stress Pathways Explain the Frequent Presence of Depression in Multiple Sclerosis  2017, The Author(s).Patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) or major depressive disorder (MDD) share a wide array of biological abnormalities which are increasingly considered to play a contributory role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of both illnesses. Shared abnormalities include peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation, chronic oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, gut dysbiosis, increased intestinal barrier permeability with bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation, neuroendocrine abnormalities and microglial pathology. Patients with MS and MDD also display a wide range of neuroimaging abnormalities and patients with MS who display symptoms of depression present with different neuroimaging profiles compared with MS patients who are depression-free. The precise details of such pathology are markedly different however. The recruitment of activated encephalitogenic Th17 T cells and subsequent bidirectional interaction leading to classically activated microglia is now considered to lie at the core of MS-specific pathology. The presence of activated microglia is common to both illnesses although the pattern of such action throughout the brain appears to be different. Upregulation of miRNAs also appears to be involved in microglial neurotoxicity and indeed T cell pathology in MS but does not appear to play a major role in MDD. It is suggested that the antidepressant lofepramine, and in particular its active metabolite desipramine, may be beneficial not only for depressive symptomatology but also for the neurological symptoms of MS. One clinical trial has been carried out thus far with, in particular, promising MRI findings."
"Intergenerational transfers, demographic transition, and altruism: Problems in developing Asia  2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdThis paper develops a three-period overlapping-generations model where middle-aged agents care about not only their own lifetime utility but also their old parents' and children's well-being. The doubly altruistic agents choose amounts of intergenerational transfers to their old parents and children as well as private savings. The government specifies amounts of public transfers from working adults to the dependents. The model also takes the effects of demographic transition on the burdens of supporting the elderly and children into account. Using 23 countries' data from the National Transfer Accounts (NTA), we estimate the degrees of filial and parental altruism and adjust them for their respective life expectancy and fertility rates. The findings suggest that people in developing countries are more parentally altruistic than those in developed ones while the adjusted degree of filial altruism tends to be low in developing Asia. Our welfare analyses reveal that the developing Asian countries must introduce more comprehensive public welfare programs for the elderly to maximize social welfare. Moreover, their low adjusted degree of filial altruism may trap the developing Asian countries at the low levels of public old-age support and social welfare as the further demographic transition ensues."
"Developing educators of European undergraduate dental students: Towards an agreed curriculum  2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: Recent developments in European dental education are student-focused, concerned with competency-based and problem-based learning. The development of dental educators has so far received little consideration. This study aimed to agree curriculum content for developing dental educators so that they are better able to support changing undergraduate dental education. Methods: Adopting consensus methodology, a 2-round Delphi was conducted in 2012. Fifty-three dental educators and 39 dental students across Europe volunteered to take part. The Delphi questionnaire was developed based on literature, piloted and sent to participants to gather opinions and seek consensus on educational content using rating scales and open-ended questions. Numeric data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results and Discussion: This study revealed 7 domains of curriculum content for dental educators. Four of these domains were considered essential: educational principles; educational practice in dentistry; curriculum, quality and improvement; and educational professionalism. Three domains were viewed as optional and could be tailored to local needs: educational principles in relation to specific contexts, educational research, and educational and healthcare management. When developing training for dental educators, factors which need consideration were identified as the academic position and teaching experience of educators, and the nature of clinical dental education. Conclusion: The results are beneficial for individual educators to inform professional development plans; institutions to devise faculty developments; ADEE to inform policies on developing European dental educators; and other disciplines to inform training for their educators."
"Health Risk Contamination of Heavy Metals in Yolk and Albumen of Duck Eggs Collected in Central and Western Thailand  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Two hundred duck egg samples were collected from 20 farms in Central and Western Thailand. The levels of Zn, Co, Mn, Fe, and Cr in yolks were found significantly higher than in albumen, whereas the levels of Cd and Cu contaminations in egg albumen were significantly higher than in yolks. The mean level of Pb contamination in whole eggs was 4.06 ± 2.70 mg kg−1 dry weight. This level was higher than the Thai agricultural standard no. 6703-2005 for duck eggs set at 0.1 ppm for the magnitude of 40.6 times. In addition, 98% (196/200) of duck egg samples had Pb levels higher than the standard limit. However, the calculation of daily intakes of Pb, Cd, and Cu contamination in the current study of duck eggs shows that these metals were lower than the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization provisional tolerated daily intake. These levels may, however, present a health risk resulting from a long-term exposure. It can be concluded that consumers may be at risk of Pb, Cd, and Cu contamination if they consume contaminated duck eggs. In addition, long-term monitoring of the health risks of heavy metals contamination should be conducted concerning the duck egg production system in Thailand."
"The Effects of Electro-Chemical Chloride Extraction on the Migration of Ions and the Corrosion State of Embedded Steel in Reinforced Concrete  2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.The effects of electrochemical chloride extraction were evaluated using different electrolytes and binders on cylindrical concrete specimens with a water/binder ratio of 0.4. Two-percent NaCl by weight of binder was added to the water as a chloride source during concrete casting. After the specimens were immersed in water for three months, direct current 0.5 A/m2 was applied to release approximately 30% initial chloride. The use of intermittent mode during extraction process was more efficient in releasing chloride than a continuous mode. After treatment, although the average remaining-chloride content was higher than threshold value, its content at the interface was only approximately 0.4%. The accumulation of alkaline ions around the embedded steel was noticeable but the distribution of calcium ions showed as different tendency. The migration of ions from the electrolyte was insignificant. This demonstrated the important role of internal ions in transferring the charge during extraction; simultaneously, the decomposition or transformation of hydrated products is inevitable. After the treatment was stopped for four weeks, the half-cell potential of the steel reached to low-corrosion state."
"Stock market return predictability: Does network topology matter?  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.This paper provides new evidence for the predictability of excess market portfolio returns using a network approach. In particular, this article introduces a measure of interconnectedness to capture the interrelationship of returns of 100 largest stocks in S&P500 during 1990–2014. In the financial network literature, the interconnection of a stock network is often regarded as a channel through which an idiosyncratic shock propagates. The idiosyncratic risk propagation is crucial to the debate over the relationship between idiosyncratic risk and market returns because the idiosyncratic risk is not always diversified away. Rather, the network can sometimes amplify the effect of the idiosyncratic risk to cause aggregate fluctuation. In accordance with this theoretical argument, I empirically show that the network topology, measured by diameter, works together with the idiosyncratic risk, measured by average stock variance, to affect the market portfolio returns. This relationship persists after controlling for well-known variables known to forecast the stock market returns."
"Euler quotients and Wilson quotients for polynomials over finite local rings  2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.In this work, we introduce the Euler quotients and the Euler quotients of degree d in polynomial rings over finite local rings. We have some analogous congruences as in the case of polynomial rings over finite fields. Moreover, we relate the sum of Euler quotients to Wilson quotient and obtain some nice congruences which allow us to have Lerch quotients."
"Hypertensive phase and its association with surgical outcomes in Baerveldt implantation  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.Purpose: To evaluate the rate of the hypertensive phase (HP) post-Baerveldt implantation and association between HP and surgical outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of glaucoma patients who had Baerveldt implantation in 2004 and completed 18 months of follow-up. At 18 months of follow-up, medical records for HP and its associated factors, and surgical outcomes such as rate of failures, intraocular pressure (IOP), numbers of medications administered, and complications were reviewed and identified. Results: Thirty-seven patients were eligible. Mean (SD) preoperative IOP was 30.5 (7.9) mmHg which significantly lowered to 13.1 (7.0) mmHg post-operation. Mean numbers of medications (SD) significantly decreased from 3.6 (0.7) to 1.3 (1.3). Failure rate at 18 months was 10.8% (4/37 patients). HP was noted in 18/37 patients (48.6%) with the onset between 1 and 3 months post-surgery. Preoperative IOP and one previous glaucoma surgery were associated with presence of HP (p = 0.010, OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.96 and p = 0.003, OR 26.12, 95% CI 2.95–231.41, respectively). The presence of HP was predictive of postoperative numbers of medications administered (p = 0.001). None of those with HP were from the failure group. Conclusion: Baerveldt implantation is an effective procedure with high success rate. HP was common after Baerveldt implantation. Preoperative IOP and numbers of previous glaucoma surgery are risk factors for developing HP. Presence of HP can predict whether long-term anti-glaucoma medication(s) are needed or not."
"Variations of characteristics of consecutive rainfall days over northern Thailand  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.The Chao Phraya basin, Thailand, is frequently inundated by flooding during the southwest monsoon period. Most floods coincide with consecutive rainfall days. This study investigated consecutive rainfall days during the southwest monsoon period at 11 stations over northern Thailand, the upstream area of this basin. The Markov chain probability model was used to study the consecutiveness of days with at least 0.1, 10.1, and 35.1 mm of rainfall. The consecutive length of rainfall days from the model showed good agreement with the observed value. A chi-square test of independence was applied to assess the significance of the consecutiveness, and it was found that days with at least 10.1 mm of rainfall tend to be consecutive over the entire area. Moreover, days with at least 35.1 mm of rainfall were found to be consecutive over the joint area where the mountainous region meets the plain area. However, the consecutiveness of days with less than 10.1 mm of rainfall was not obvious. The rainfall amount on days with at least 10.1 mm of rainfall was also calculated and it showed lower values over the mountainous region than over the plain. Hence, this study established the characteristics of consecutive rainfall days over the plain, mountainous region, and joint area."
"Estimation of fatality ratios and investigation of influential factors in the 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami  2017 Elsevier LtdThe 2011 Great East Japan earthquake caused a wide-ranging and devastating tsunami that reached a maximum height of 40 m and caused 19,000 fatalities, particularly along the Tohoku coast of Japan. The purpose of this study is to present a new estimation of the fatality ratios based on tsunami arrival times and evacuation perspectives and to present lessons learned for future tsunami loss assessments in other areas. In addition, this study investigates influencing factors, such as age, gender, and two coastal topography types (Sanriku ria-coast and Sendai plain). The fatality ratio is calculated by the number of fatalities divided by the population at the town scale along the shoreline, and the tsunami arrival time is calculated using the TUNAMI model with nesting grids of 1350 m, 450 m, 150 m, and 50 m. Then, linear and nonlinear regression analyses are performed to develop a relationship between the fatality ratios and tsunami arrival times. For different topography types, different distributions of fatality ratios with tsunami arrival times were observed; the fatality ratios of the Sendai plain were generally higher than those of the Sanriku ria-coast for the same arrival time. Based on the results, a strong inverse correlation between the fatality ratios and the tsunami arrival times was found in the Sendai plain, while the Sanriku ria-coast must be divided into two groups to obtain this correlation. Furthermore, other influencing factors, such as age and gender, contributed to differences in estimating the fatality ratios."
"Tsunami evacuation experiment using a mobile application: A design science approach  2017 Elsevier LtdDisaster evacuation drills are one of the important soft countermeasures to ensure proper response when a real tsunami arrives. With the goal of enhancing the traditional evacuation drill, this study developed a mobile application prototype to be used as an educational tool in a drill exercise. The mobile application retrieves the current location of the user and shows the inundation depth of the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami, together with the map, latitude, and longitude. Experiments were conducted in the town of Matsushima and the city of Iwanuma in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, to investigate the effect of using the information provided. These locations were affected by the 2011 tsunami. The results revealed a change in the behavior and decision making of the participants, who considered the inundation depth of their evacuation route and the safety of their chosen destination. This application does not require complex techniques; thus, teachers, drill executors, and community leaders can follow this strategy to enhance their tsunami evacuation drills using mobile devices."
"Influences of moisture content on resilient modulus of unbound crushed limestone  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The design method of pavement structure is evolving to the new Mechanistic-Empirical (M-E) approach. A major benefit of M-E approach is being able to identify the distress patterns and the progress rate of a given pavement structure. This is possible by the knowledge of mechanistic characteristics of pavement materials responding to the repeated loads and environmental changes. Resilient modulus of the unbound granular material is the fundamental parameter needed in the mechanistic analysis of pavement structure. The resilient modulus behavior responding to moisture changes is the key contribution to the structural strength of conventional pavement in Thailand. This study investigated the resilient modulus of the road base materials for the M-E approach. In this research, a set of laboratory tests were conducted on unbound crushed limestone. Two gradations of the limestone were selected to determine the resilient modulus using the repeated-load tri-axial test according to AASHTO T307. Test results revealed that water content played a significant influence to the resilient modulus value. The resilient modulus characteristic of limestone UGM observed from these tests can be employed in Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design."
"Study of aeration and CO2 absorption using filtration membranes in terms of physical properties and mass transfer parameters  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Hollow fiber membrane contactor is nowadays one of the alternative absorption processes for the conventional bubble column. In this work, the performances of microporous hollow fiber membranes for aeration and CO2 absorption were investigated and compared with a conventional bubble column. The membranes used in this work were adapted from filtration membranes which are significantly cheaper than conventional absorption membranes. The effects of operating variables such as average pore sizes, gas flow rates, liquid flow rates, number of hollow fiber membrane, and concentrations of chemical solution on the gas-liquid absorption rate were determined. For oxygen-water absorption, the overall mass transfer coefficient (kLa), which corresponding to the absorption rate, increased with the increase of membrane porous diameter. The kLa was also enhanced with the increase of the liquid flow rate and the number of membranes while the gas flow rate was rarely influent. For carbon dioxide absorption, the increase in liquid flow rate and the carbon dioxide concentration resulted in higher mass transfer rate. Moreover, adding sodium carbonate in absorbent improved the kLa value up to 2.2 folds, comparing with physical absorption. The comparison between the membrane contractor and a bubble column indicated that the utilization of filtration membranes had more efficiency comparing to bubble column due to its high surface area and adaptability when operating with the same size especially when using lower gas velocity rate."
"Fire resistance performance of reactive powder concrete columns  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.This paper experimentally explores the fire resistance of reactive powder concrete (RPC) columns with varying steel and polypropylene (PP) fiber content. RPC is a concrete composition with the highest developed compressive strength and is incorporated with steel fibers that can improve the tensile strength and ductility of RPC structures. The fire resistance of RPC structures, however, has been disputed by engineers and researchers. Four columns with different weight contents of fiber were tested in fire for 30 and 60 minutes with a load applied afterwards. Then, the performance of RPC columns in elevated temperature was investigated, focusing on spalling depth, failure mechanism in fiber and residual strength. The results showed that increasing the volume fraction of steel fiber or the presence of PP fiber improves the fire resistance of the columns. However, the columns lost significant cross-sectional area and load capacity. With the knowledge that this research would provide, a better understanding for making decisions could be developed."
"A two-step adaptive noise cancellation system for dental-drill noise reduction  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.This paper introduces a two-step dental-drill Noise Reduction (NR) technique based upon the Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) system. The proposed technique is particularly designed for the NR headphone, which the patients should be wearing while having their dental treatment. Similarly, the dentists are also suggested to wear these NR headphones to prevent hearing impairment due to excessively high level of drill noise. In the first step of the proposed NR technique, a tone-frequency extraction algorithm is proposed to estimate the main spectral component of the dental-drill noise. A sinusoidal signal with the estimated tone frequency is generated and subsequently fed to the first adaptive filter of the ANC system to remove the main tone frequency from the dental-drill noise. In the second-step, another adaptive filter of the ANC system is then employed to eliminate the residual high-frequency components of the dental-drill noise. Computer simulations based on recorded dental-drill sounds and real speech signals demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-step dental-drill NR (TSDNR) technique, both in terms of the noise attenuation performance and the speech quality of the enhanced speech signal. Moreover, results of a subjective listening test with 15 listeners are also given to guarantee satisfied speech quality of the enhanced speech signal employing the proposed TSDNR technique."
"Important role of abiotic sulfide oxidation in microbial fuel cells treating high-sulfate wastewater  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been considered as an alternative for the treatment and energy recovery of organic wastewater containing sulfate, which cannot be achieved via conventional anaerobic treatment processes. This study investigates the performances and mechanisms of two-compartment single-chamber MFCs treating sulfate-rich organic wastewater at the chemical oxygen demand (COD) to sulfate ratio of 1, 3, and 6 in MFC1, MFC3, and MFC6, respectively. The first compartments functioned as anaerobic bioreactors. In the second compartments where fuel cell apparatuses were installed, sulfide removal was 49.51 ± 57.74, 24.08 ± 13.74, and 15.69 ± 21.30 mgS2-/L in MFC1, MFC3, and MFC6, respectively. The maximum power generation amounts of 9.33, 1.79, and 1.41 mW/m2 were achieved in MFC1, MFC3, and MFC6, respectively. A higher sulfide concentration in MFC1 contributed to higher power generation in MFC1. The main mechanism of electrical generation in all MFCs was abiotic sulfide oxidation."
"Corrosion behavior of Ni steels in aerated 3.5-wt.% NaCl solution at 25ºC by potentiodynamic method  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.This work studied the corrosion behaviors of 15Ni, 23Ni, 31Ni and 40Ni steels in aerated 3.5% NaCl solutions with various pH levels (2, 7 and 10) at 25ºC. The observed microstructures of 15 and 23 wt.% Ni steels were consisted partially of martensite, while those of 31 and 40 wt.% Ni steels were fully austenitic. Polarization curves of the nickel-containing steels were determined using a potentiodynamic polarization technique. The corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current density (Icorr), corrosion rate (Rmpy), pitting potential (Ep), primary passive potential (Epp) and passive current density (Ip) were evaluated from the polarization curves. The results indicated that an increase in nickel content resulted in an increased corrosion potential, but also a decreased corrosion current density or corrosion rate. Only the solution pH of 10, the passive characteristics of the 23Ni, 31Ni and 40Ni steels were remarkable. As the nickel content of those three nickel-containing steels increased, the primary passive potentials and pitting potentials were increased, but the passive current densities were decreased. Nickel additions improved general corrosion and pitting corrosion resistances of the nickel-containing steels when tested in basic, neutral and acidic 3.5% NaCl solutions. The effects of various nickel contents and solution pHs on general corrosion resistances of nickel-containing steels were also discussed."
"Automatic transformation of ordinary timed petri nets into Event-B for formal verification  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The behavioral correctness of real-time software systems relies on both the results of its computation and the clock times when the results are produced. Obviously, formal verification of the safety and correctness of real-time software specification from the very beginning of the software design phase obviously helps us reduce the development efforts. From a practical point of view, the timed Petri net is commonly used to graphically model and illustrate the view of the timed behavior of real-time software systems, which is a good basis for an understanding of a model. However, there is a lack of development process software for the simulation of a timed Petri net. Alternatively, formal verification using the Event-B specification method provides an efficient automatic theorem proving tool which is focused on the development process and provides an efficient verified internal data of software. Unfortunately writing an Event-B specification from scratch is still difficult and a mathematical logic background is needed. In this paper, we propose an automatic transformation of ordinary timed Petri nets into Event-B specifications. The basic notations in the ordinary timed Petri nets are considered and mapped into the code fragments of Event-B. The final resulting Event-B codes are generated in the well-formed format which is required and successfully verified by an Event-B prover called a Rodin tool."
"Designing prediction markets to achieve convergence speed  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The aim of this paper is twofold: to propose the model of artificial prediction markets that capture the characteristics of real prediction markets and to study the impact of key parameters on the performance of the proposed markets. In the experiments, the artificial markets are implemented and the market performance in terms of convergence speed is measured. Our experimental results show that the number of traders and the mean value of initial belief have no significant impact on the convergence speed. However, the trader’s memory size impacts negatively on the convergence because of its delay in adjusting to the true value. Finally, the external information transmission rate and the ratio of smart traders have positive impacts on the convergence of the prediction markets. The insights can assist a market maker in designing and constructing more efficient prediction markets."
"On Schur multiple zeta functions: A combinatoric generalization of multiple zeta functions  2018 Elsevier Inc.We introduce Schur multiple zeta functions which interpolate both the multiple zeta and multiple zeta-star functions of the Euler–Zagier type combinatorially. We first study their basic properties including a region of absolute convergence and the case where all variables are the same. Then, under an assumption on variables, some determinant formulas coming from theory of Schur functions such as the Jacobi–Trudi, Giambelli and dual Cauchy formula are established with the help of Macdonald's ninth variation of Schur functions. Moreover, we investigate the quasi-symmetric functions corresponding to the Schur multiple zeta functions. We obtain the similar results as above for them and, furthermore, describe the images of them by the antipode of the Hopf algebra of quasi-symmetric functions explicitly. Finally, we establish iterated integral representations of the Schur multiple zeta values of ribbon type, which yield a duality for them in some cases."
"The dynamics of the piglet gut microbiome during the weaning transition in association with health and nutrition  2018 The Author(s).Background: Understanding the composition of the microbial community and its functional capacity during weaning is important for pig production as bacteria play important roles in the pig's health and growth performance. However, limited information is available regarding the composition and function of the gut microbiome of piglets in early-life. Therefore, we performed 16S rRNA gene and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing of DNA from fecal samples from healthy piglets during weaning to measure microbiome shifts, and to identify the potential contribution of the early-life microbiota in shaping piglet health with a focus on microbial stress responses, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Results: The analysis of 16S rRNA genes and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing revealed significant compositional and functional differences between the fecal microbiome in nursing and weaned piglets. The fecal microbiome of the nursing piglets showed higher relative abundance of bacteria in the genus Bacteroides with abundant gene families related to the utilization of lactose and galactose. Prevotella and Lactobacillus were enriched in weaned piglets with an enrichment for the gene families associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. In addition, an analysis of the functional capacity of the fecal microbiome showed higher abundances of genes associated with heat shock and oxidative stress in the metagenome of weaned piglets compared to nursing piglets. Conclusions: Overall, our data show that microbial shifts and changes in functional capacities of the piglet fecal microbiome resulted in potential reductions in the effects of stress, including dietary changes that occur during weaning. These results provide us with new insights into the piglet gut microbiome that contributes to the growth of the animal."
"A new formaldehyde sensor from silver nanoclusters modified Tollens’ reagent  2018 Elsevier LtdA selective colorimetric assay for detecting formaldehyde (FA) was proposed based on silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) templated by polymethacrylic acid (PMAA). The chemodosimeter was easily fabricated by the formation of Tollens’ reagent in the presence of AgNCs (AgNCs@Tollens). The detection principle was based on the change in the color caused by the change in the particle size from nanoclusters (no LSPR) to nanoparticles (with LSPR) upon the reduction of Tollens’ reagent by FA. In the presence of FA, the intensity of a new absorbance band with a maximum at a wavelength of 430 nm corresponding to the LSPR of the AgNPs linearly increased as a function of the FA concentration, exhibiting a color change that could be observed by the naked eye. This method provided a working range of 30–50 µM with lower detection limit (LOD) of 27.99 µM. The proposed method exhibited excellent selectivity towards FA over other aldehyde-containing compounds."
"Are consumers forward looking? Evidence from used iPhones  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This study examines the impact of planned obsolescence–the introduction of new models to make existing models obsolete–on secondary markets for mobile phones. Using data of over 320,000 used iPhones listings on Thailand’s largest online marketplace, we document that iPhone prices decrease with age, around 2.8–3.2% for each passing month. We find no evidence that the price decline accelerates after launches of new models (i.e. obsolescence), lending support to the view that consumer in durable goods markets are rational and forward looking."
"Heuristic based scheduling for tablets film coating process  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.In the pharmaceutical industry, tablets film coating planning concerns a finding of coating sequences on parallel machines such that both the completion time and number of tardy jobs are minimized. This problem is made more difficult when a wide variety of drugs is produced as changing from one to another drug requires considerably long period of cleaning and setup times - these times also vary depending on the previously coated drug. We show that this problem could be transformed into the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (VRPTW), where a variable arc exch an ge heur istic - whose concep t is based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) - is devised to solve such a problem. Our proposed heuristic is a two-phase one, where the initial solutions are constructed from easy-to-implement dispatching heuristics, i.e. Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Longest Processing Time (LPT). The initial solution is then iteratively improved by a series of local-search operators, including 2OPT, RELOCATION, and SWAP. The results from our proposed heuristic is comparatively good, when compared to those of the optimization model in terms of solution quality as the gap is less than 5% for instances of 20 orders; but, it requires much less computation time, which is crucial from a practical point of view."
"The roles of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-EP4 receptors in HPV-induced carcinogenesis  2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.Cervical cancer is mainly caused by infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially type 16. Oncoprotein HPV16 E6 was suggested to play an important role in inducing carcinogenesis. One well known mechanism is HPV16E6 which binds p53, a tumor suppressor protein and induces its degradation resulting in inhibition of cell apoptosis. In cervical cancer cells, an increase of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-EP4 receptors were demonstrated, suggesting the other role of E6 protein. There are several mechanisms of cellular signal transduction involved in COX-2 expression. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signalling, a key regulator of normal cell growth and cell fate decision is one of them. HPV oncoproteins such as E5, E6 and E7 have a correlation with COX-2 expression through various pathways. The current study reveals that HPV16E6 protein induces COX-2 gene and protein expression through PI3K/Akt signalling pathway in association with the increase of PGE2-EP4 receptors, which leads to promoting carcinogenesis."

"Introduction  2019 selection and editorial matter, Chanintira na Thalang, Soravis Jayanama and Jittipat Poonkham; individual chapters, the contributors.This book is about the current state of International Relations (IR) as an academic discipline in Thailand and how its practical experience and knowledge can contribute to the wider debates of IR. It places itself within the debates of ‘Global IR’ and ŉon-Western IR’ that have not only broadened the way IR is interpreted in a variety of geographical spaces but have also led to a critical examination of the usefulness and applicability of IR theories and concepts sourced from the West for explaining the growing complexities and problems in other parts of the world. In light of this debate, this volume seeks to reflect on the ethnocentric nature of IR through an exploration of its status and its subfields in Thailand. The book is divided into three parts. The first part looks at the impact various Western theories have had on the development of Thai IR theorising. The second part examines the various sub-fields of IR in Thailand. It seeks to elucidate what factors have hindered or provided opportunities for the development of an indigenous sourced IR theory, as well as to examine the implications of indigenous knowledge and experience with respect to the advancement of IR as a discipline. The third part critically reflects on the developments in IR in Thailand."
"Security studies in Thailand  2019 selection and editorial matter, Chanintira na Thalang, Soravis Jayanama and Jittipat Poonkham; individual chapters, the contributors.This chapter aims to examine the landscape of security studies in Thailand since King Rama V implemented governance reforms and successfully consolidated power. It is by no means a thorough investigation of the subject, though it should provide a sufficient overview of this nascent area of study. Indigenous conceptualization of security in Thailand, which is entwined with the integrity of the state, has proved quite inflexible to newer, less state-centric conceptions of security. However, the interpretation of security in Thailand is dynamic and has been shaped and reshaped predominantly through the experiences and expectations of an exclusive circle of political and military elites. It was only toward the end of the Cold War that academics and civilians had an increased role in broadening the concept of security. However, despite numerous academic books and articles on security produced by Thai scholars, it cannot be ascertained that any Thai security theory has been developed. In the case of Thailand, particular actors, namely those with strong ties to the state, are consistently “privileged, "" resulting in the lack of debate as well as sustained efforts in theorizing the field. Despite the lack of theorizing, security studies in Thailand generally has an underlying tenet of realism, although the use of said theories is not always clear. Neorealist concerns are less explicit, given that the effects of international structure on unit-level actors are understudied in scholarly works. All in all, scholarly work in security in Thailand (if not outright empirical) have “borrowed” or “imported” International Relations (IR) theory existing elsewhere as well as international political economy concepts (Sunait et al. 2013) to help explain issues or phenomena concerning Thailand’s security. Critical security studies found their peers in small academic circles. The use of theory in security studies in Thailand (if any) remains heavily reliant on Western IR theory or the key works therein."
"European studies in Thailand  2019 selection and editorial matter, Chanintira na Thalang, Soravis Jayanama and Jittipat Poonkham; individual chapters, the contributors.To examine the obstacles to and prospects for the advancement of an indigenous sourced International Relations (IR) theory, this chapter traces the trajectory of European studies in Thailand since the Cold War. It first examines the boundaries of the discipline in Thailand and questions why European studies has been placed under the rubric of IR rather than becoming a discipline in its own right. It then compares European studies in Thailand with other national academic contexts to highlight the similarities and differences shared between European studies in the Western and non-Western worlds. Finally, the chapter surveys the key scholars of European studies in Thailand and their work in search of any possible theoretical contributions to Thai IR."
"International relations as a discipline in Thailand: Theory and sub-fields  2019 selection and editorial matter, Chanintira na Thalang, Soravis Jayanama and Jittipat Poonkham; individual chapters, the contributors.There has long been considerable debate about the nature of non-Western IR theory. Most attempts to understand such a phenomenon begin by taking a top-down approach on a country by country basis. Instead, this book takes a bottom-up approach, involving specialists from a range of Thai universities, revealing the contours of the Thai IR community. It examines the state of various sub-fields under the IR rubric in Thailand such as foreign policy analysis, security studies, international political economy and area studies, and how Thai thinkers in these fields have contributed to IR as a discipline and IR theory development in Thailand. In doing so, it identifies factors unique to Thai academia which have hindered the development of an indigenous-sourced theory as well as exploring the similarities shared with other non-Western contexts that have posed an obstacle to the creation of a more general non-Western IR theory. Providing both an in-depth insight into the specific phenomena of Thai IR theory, and a broader perspective on the challenges of formulating non-Western IR theory, this book aims to push the debate on non-Western IR theory forward. It will be of particular interest to readers looking for a better understanding of IR theory in Thailand, but also for those more generally looking to formulate and characterise non-Western approaches to the discipline."
"Minding the gap: Poststructuralist IR theory in Thailand  2019 selection and editorial matter, Chanintira na Thalang, Soravis Jayanama and Jittipat Poonkham; individual chapters, the contributors.To shed light on the status and state of poststructuralism in the teaching and studying of International Relations (IR) in Thailand, I would like to begin with a variation of a well-known Groucho Marx line that is often recounted by Slavoj Žižek (2014, 93): “No matter how hard you try to find it, it may look like there’s no poststructuralist IR theory in Thailand, but don’t let that fool you- there really is no poststructuralist IR theory in Thailand.” In short, I will be writing about something that either does not exist or whose traces are so weak that it is virtually non-existent. There is always the accompanying risk of overstating (e.g., my contributions) and/or understating (e.g., other academics’ roles). Ever-present too is the temptation to turn this piece into an “academic selfie, "" capitalizing on the “selfie pandemic” of the twenty-first century (Horvat and Davis 2015)."
"Is orbital floor a reliable and useful surgical landmark in endoscopic endonasal surgery?: A systematic review  2018 The Author(s).Background: The orbital floor is considered as an important intraoperative reference point in endoscopic sinonasal surgery. The aim of this review is to evaluate its reliability and usefulness as a surgical landmark in endoscopic endonasal surgery. Methods: A literature search was performed on electronic databases, namely PUBMED. The following keywords were used either individually or in combination: orbital floor; maxillary sinus roof; endoscopic skull base surgery; endoscopic sinus surgery. Studies that used orbital floor as a landmark for endoscopic endonasal surgery were included in the analysis. In addition, relevant articles were identified from the references of articles that had been retrieved. The search was conducted over a period of 6 months between 1st June 2017 and 16th December 2017. Results: One thousand seven hundred forty-three articles were retrieved from the electronic databases. Only 5 articles that met the review criteria were selected. Five studies of the orbital floor (or the maxillary sinus roof) were reviewed, one was a cadaveric study while another 4 were computed tomographic study of the paranasal sinuses. All studies were of level III evidence and consists of a total number of 948 nostrils. All studies showed the orbital floor was below the anterior skull base irrespective of the populations. The orbital floor serves as a guide for safe entry into posterior ethmoids and sphenoid sinus. Conclusions: The orbital floor is a reliable and useful surgical landmark in endoscopic endonasal surgery. In revision cases or advanced disease, the normal landmarks can be distorted or absent and the orbital floor serves as a reference point for surgeons to avoid any unintentional injury to the skull base, the internal carotid artery and other critical structures."
"Acid-base fractions separated from Streblus asper leaf ethanolic extract exhibited antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-acetylcholinesterase, and neuroprotective activities  2018 The Author(s).Background: Streblus asper is a well-known plant native to Southeast Asia. Different parts of the plant have been traditionally used for various medicinal purposes. However, there is very little scientific evidence reporting its therapeutic benefits for potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to evaluate antibacterial, antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, and neuroprotective properties of S. asper leaf extracts with the primary objective of enhancing therapeutic applications and facilitating activity-guided isolation of the active chemical constituents. Methods: The leaves of S. asper were extracted in ethanol and subsequently fractionated into neutral, acid and base fractions. The phytochemical constituents of each fraction were analyzed using GC-MS. The antibacterial activity was evaluated using a broth microdilution method. The antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays. The neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced toxicity was tested on hippocampal neuronal HT22 cell line by evaluating the cell viability using MTT assay. The AChE inhibitory activity was screened by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) bioautographic method. Results: The partition of the S. asper ethanolic leaf extract yielded the highest mass of phytochemical constitutions in the neutral fraction and the lowest in the basic fraction. Amongst the three fractions, the acidic fraction showed the strongest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. The antioxidant activities of three fractions were found in the order of acidic > basic > neutral, whereas the decreasing order of neuroprotective activity was neutral > basic > acidic. TLC bioautography revealed one component in the neutral fraction exhibited anti-AChE activity. While in the acid fraction, two components showed inhibitory activity against AChE. GC-MS analysis of three fractions showed the presence of major phytochemical constituents including terpenoids, steroids, phenolics, fatty acids, and lipidic plant hormone. Conclusions: Our findings have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of three fractions extracted from S. asper leaves as a promising natural source for neuroprotective agents with additional actions of antibacterials and antioxidants, along with AChE inhibitors that will benefit in the development of new natural compounds in therapies against AD."
"Use of agro-industrial residue from the canned pineapple industry for polyhydroxybutyrate production by Cupriavidus necator strain A-04  2018 The Author(s).Background: Pineapple is the third most important tropical fruit produced worldwide, and approximately 24.8 million tons of this fruit are produced annually throughout the world, including in Thailand, which is the fourth largest pineapple producer in the world. Pineapple wastes (peel and core) are generated in a large amount equal to approximately 59.36% based on raw material. In general, the anaerobic digestion of pineapple wastes is associated with a high biochemical oxygen demand and high chemical oxygen demand, and this process generates methane and can cause greenhouse gas emissions if good waste management practices are not enforced. This study aims to fill the research gap by examining the feasibility of pineapple wastes for promoting the high-value-added production of biodegradable polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from the available domestic raw materials. The objective of this study was to use agro-industrial residue from the canned pineapple industry for biodegradable PHB production. Results: The results indicated that pretreatment with an alkaline reagent is not necessary. Pineapple core was sized to - 20/+ 40 mesh particle and then hydrolyzed with 1.5% (v/v) H2SO4 produced the highest concentration of fermentable sugars, equal to 0.81 g/g dry pineapple core, whereas pineapple core with a + 20 mesh particle size and hydrolyzed with 1.5% (v/v) H3PO4 yielded the highest concentration of PHB substrates (57.2 ± 1.0 g/L). The production of PHB from core hydrolysate totaled 35.6 ± 0.1% (w/w) PHB content and 5.88 ± 0.25 g/L cell dry weight. The use of crude aqueous extract (CAE) of pineapple waste products (peel and core) as a culture medium was investigated. CAE showed very promising results, producing the highest PHB content of 60.00 ± 0.5% (w/w), a cell dry weight of 13.6 ± 0.2 g/L, a yield (Y-{{{P \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {P S}} \right. \kern-0pt} S}}} Y P / S) of 0.45 g PHB/g PHB substrate, and a productivity of 0.160 g/(L h). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pineapple waste products from the canned pineapple industry as lignocellulosic feedstocks for PHB production. C. necator strain A-04 was able to grow on various sugars and tolerate levulinic acid and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, and a detoxification step was not required prior to the conversion of cellulose hydrolysate to PHB. In addition to acid hydrolysis, CAE was identified as a potential carbon source and offers a novel method for the low-cost production of PHB from a realistic lignocellulosic biomass feedstock.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Separation and detection of mutans streptococci by using magnetic nanoparticles stabilized with a cell wall binding domain-conjugated polymer  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.A number of salivary mutans streptococci (MS: Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus) are used in dental caries risk assessment. In this study, a simple, yet effective assay was developed for MS detection. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were first grafted with poly(acrylic acid) that bears active carboxyl groups available for conjugation with the cell wall binding domain (CWBD) of automutanolysin which specifically binds to MS. The binding efficiency of CWBD-conjugated MNPs to MS was tested with pure cultures of streptococcal standard strains. After mixing CWBD-conjugated MNPs with culture, bacteria-bound particles were separated from unbound cells using a magnet and filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane (pore-size 0.8 μm). The color intensity of particles remaining on the membrane represents the number of bound bacteria. The CWBD-conjugated MNPs showed higher efficiency in binding to S. mutans and S. sobrinus than to non-mutans streptococci (S. sanguinis and S. salivarius) with capture efficiencies of 77 and 69% for MS and 38 and 15% for non-MS. Moreover, this method can quantify the number of MS in the range of 102 to 107 colony-forming units (CFU) mL-1, which covers the range of MS levels used in caries risk assessment. The calculated limit of detection of the assay was 16 and 72 CFU mL-1 for S. mutans and S. sobrinus, respectively. Furthermore, the CWBD-conjugated MNPs could be used to efficiently quantify the number of MS in human saliva samples containing highly complex mixtures of bacterial species. These results suggest that the assay could be applicable as a simple tool for MS determination in not only clinical settings but also community fields without clinical expert requirement."
"Characteristics of curcumin-loaded bacterial cellulose films and anticancer properties against malignant melanoma skin cancer cells  2018 by the authors.Curcumin-loaded bacterial cellulose films were developed in this study. Curcumin was absorbed into never-dried bacterial cellulose pellicles by 24-h immersion in solutions of curcumin in the range of 0.2-1.0 mg/mL. The curcumin-loaded bacterial cellulose pellicles were then air-dried and characterized. The mechanical properties of curcumin-loaded bacterial cellulose films, particularly the stretching properties, appeared to be lower than those of bacterial cellulose film. This was especially evident when the loading concentration of curcumin was higher than 0.4 mg/mL. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated an interaction between bacterial cellulose microfibrils and curcumin. Controlled release of curcumin was achieved in buffer solutions containing Tween 80 and methanol additives, at pH 5.5 and 7.4. Curcumin-loaded bacterial cellulose films prepared with curcumin solutions at concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL displayed antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger. They also exhibited anticancer activity against A375 malignant melanoma cells. No significant cytotoxic effect was observed against normal dermal cells, specifically, human keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts."
"The association of depression and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: An umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses  2018 The Author(s).Background: Depression is a prevalent and disabling mental disorder that frequently co-occurs with a wide range of chronic conditions. Evidence has suggested that depression could be associated with excess all-cause mortality across different settings and populations, although the causality of these associations remains unclear. Methods: We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase electronic databases were searched through January 20, 2018. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated associations of depression and all-cause and cause-specific mortality were selected for the review. The evidence was graded as convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak based on quantitative criteria that included an assessment of heterogeneity, 95% prediction intervals, small-study effects, and excess significance bias. Results: A total of 26 references providing 2 systematic reviews and data for 17 meta-analytic estimates met inclusion criteria (19 of them on all-cause mortality); data from 246 unique studies (N = 3,825,380) were synthesized. All 17 associations had P < 0.05 per random effects summary effects, but none of them met criteria for convincing evidence. Associations of depression and all-cause mortality in patients after acute myocardial infarction, in individuals with heart failure, in cancer patients as well as in samples from mixed settings met criteria for highly suggestive evidence. However, none of the associations remained supported by highly suggestive evidence in sensitivity analyses that considered studies employing structured diagnostic interviews. In addition, associations of depression and all-cause mortality in cancer and post-acute myocardial infarction samples were supported only by suggestive evidence when studies that tried to adjust for potential confounders were considered. Conclusions: Even though associations between depression and mortality have nominally significant results in all assessed settings and populations, the evidence becomes weaker when focusing on studies that used structured interviews and those that tried to adjust for potential confounders. A causal effect of depression on all-cause and cause-specific mortality remains unproven, and thus interventions targeting depression are not expected to result in lower mortality rates at least based on current evidence from observational studies."
"A Study of Relation between Tool Wear and Dynamic Cutting Force Ratio in CNC Turning  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Since tool wear directly affects the manufacturing cost in CNC turning process, the aim of this research is to study the effects of cutting conditions on tool wear and dynamic cutting force ratio. It also describes relation of tool wear and dynamic cutting force ratio. The results of experiment show that cutting speed is the most significantly influential factor followed by feed rate, depth of cut and nose radius respectively. In addition, effect of dynamic cutting force on the tool wear analysis show that trend of the dynamic cutting force is not changed even though the cutting condition is changed. Accordingly, the tool wear can be predicted by using the dynamic cutting force ratio in turning process."
"Impacts of Coastal Development on the Shoreline Change of the Eastern Gulf of Thailand  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The Map Ta Phut (MTP) Port has been developed on the middle portion of the Rayong Bay, Thailand, since 1992. After the expansion of the port completed in 2002, the port has an approximately 3.5 km wide and extending 4.0 km seaward. This paper provides the assessment of the construction of the MTP Port project on the shoreline of the Rayong Bay. Historical shoreline positions were extracted from aerial photography and satellite imagery taken between 1957 and 2016 using ArcGIS version 10.4. The rates of shoreline changes pre- and post-port development were implemented using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Results indicate that the Rayong Bay shoreline mostly was in dynamic equilibrium with an average rate of less than 0.5 m/y prior the construction of the MTP port. After the completion of the port, a significant shoreline accretion has continuously been found along the shoreline of about 500 m adjacent to both sides of the port. Meanwhile, the Rayong Bay shoreline had been eroded about 28 % of the total shoreline after the port completed in 1992 and increased to 30% after the port expansion in 2002. Coastal protection structures included seawalls, segment breakwater, Y-shaped groins, and jetty were applied along the receded shore. Most of those structures have successfully stabilized the shoreline, and the Rayong Bay has likely reached a new dynamic equilibrium since 2011."
"Development of platinum supported on single-walled carbon nanotubes by deposition-precipitation for microbial fuel cells For microbial fuel cells Microbial fuel cells (MFC) are an ecologically friendly technology that can recover electricity and simultaneously treat wastewater. Among all the influential factors, cathode material and catalyst play a critical role in electricity production and oxygen reduction. Pt nanocatalysts deposited on single-walled carbon nanotubes (Pt/SWCNT) were prepared via the deposition-precipitation (DP) method under optimal conditions. The results showed that DP could be a potential method for the preparation of Pt/SWCNT due to its simple, cost-effective and time-saving procedure, in addition to being highly efficient at creating small Pt particles (0.9 nm) that were very uniformly distributed. The synthesized Pt/SWCNT suspension was spray-coated on to carbon cloth and then used as a cathode for MFC. The electricity generation of MFC equipped with a Pt/SWCNT cathode was assessed in terms of open circuit voltage (0.6954 V), internal resistance (63.3 Ω•sq m) and maximum power density (2,022 mW/sq m). The chemical oxygen demand removal, biological oxygen demand removal, total dissolved solids removal, total suspended solids removal and silver recovery was satisfactory at 84.5%, 74.0%, 45.7%, 60.0% and 99.0%, respectively."
"A Data Imputation Model in Phasor Measurement Units Based on Bagged Averaging of Multiple Linear Regression  2013 IEEE.Synchrophasor data from the phasor measurement unit (PMU) indicate the health of the electrical system. However, the PMU performance relies entirely on a supported communication network. The existing communication approaches do not guarantee the error-free channel for the PMU network. Meanwhile, the mean or median approaches are commonly used to impute the missing value. These methods, however, fail to recover some valuable frequency events. In this paper, we first proved the multiple linear regression features in many synchronized frequency data streams in the short-time window. Then, we proposed the Bagged Averaging of Multiple Linear Regression model, which handles and fulfills the missing values in synchronized frequency data measurement fast and efficiently. This technique was based on the ensemble learning by bootstrapping and averaging many multiple linear regressions to predict the missing values. Various experiments on the synchronized frequency measurement data from the Texas synchrophasor network have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach in recovering the missing frequency events. Our proposed approach guarantees the performance of real-time wide area monitoring system applications, such as frequency analysis or stability monitoring and trending."
"The most 5' truncating homozygous mutation of WNT1 in siblings with osteogenesis imperfecta with a variable degree of brain anomalies: A case report  2018 The Author(s).Background: WNT1 mutations cause bone fragility as well as brain anomalies. There are some reported cases of WNT1 mutations with normal cognition. Genotype and phenotype correlation of WNT1 mutations has not been established. Case presentation: Here we present two female siblings with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) born to a consanguineous couple. Both sustained severe bone deformities. However, only the younger had severe brain anomalies resulting in an early death from pneumonia, while the older had normal intellectual development. Next generation sequencing showed a homozygous mutation, c.6delG, p.Leu3Serfs*36 in WNT1. To our knowledge, it is the most 5' truncating mutation to date. Conclusion: This report emphasizes the intrafamilial variability of brain anomalies found in this OI type and suggests that WNT1 may not be necessary for normal human cognitive development."
"Criticality at absolute zero from Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations  2018 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.We reconsider the criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations based on the N×N Hermitian two-matrix model with the introduction of a loop-counting parameter and linear terms in the potential. We show that in the large-N limit even though the Ising model is classical, the critical temperature can reach absolute zero by tuning the loop-counting parameter, and the corresponding continuum theory turns out to be the quantized theory of neither pure gravity nor gravity coupled to conformal matter with central charge being 1/2."
"Electrochemical evaluation of corrosion resistance of trivalent chromate conversion coatings with different organic additives  2018 ISIJ.The corrosion resistance of electrogalvanized steels with trivalent chromate conversion coatings is investigated electrochemically to analyze the effect of organic additives on the corrosion resistance under wet-dry cyclic conditions. Three sets of polyamine additives, namely (i) imidazole and epihalohydrin, (ii) polyquaternary amine salt, and (iii) polyethyleneimine, are examined and compared. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and anodic stripping were employed to evaluate the corrosion resistance. Crystal-structure and compositional analyses were also applied to demonstrate the role of organic additives in controlling the structure of the zinc layer and the formation of the trivalent chromate conversion film."
"Clinical and Dosimetric Factors Predicting Grade ≥2 Radiation Pneumonitis After Postoperative Radiotherapy for Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma  2018Purpose: To identify clinical and dosimetric factors that would predict grade ≥2 radiation pneumonitis (RP) for patients undergoing postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and to use the factors identified to generate a predictive model to quantify risk of RP in such patients. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed radiation therapy, radiographic, and clinical data from 199 patients who had received PORT, with or without chemotherapy, for NSCLC. Potential associations between dosimetric and clinical factors and RP were evaluated in univariate and multivariate Cox regression hazard models and competing risk analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate overall survival and the cumulative incidence of RP, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to identify cutpoints for variables found to influence RP risk. The endpoint was grade ≥2 RP (symptomatic, requiring steroids or limiting instrumental activities of daily living). Results: Thirty-seven patients (19%) developed grade ≥2 RP. Patient-related factors, type of surgery or chemotherapy, and radiation therapy–related factors were not associated with grade ≥2 RP; only lung V10 > 30% and lung V20 > 20% predicted grade ≥2 RP. Risk groupings were as follows: high risk, V10 > 30% and V20 > 20% (24 of 72 patients, 33%); intermediate risk, V10 > 30% and V20 ≤ 20% or V10 ≤ 30% and V20 > 20% (6 of 26 patients, 23%); and low risk, V10 ≤ 30% and V20 ≤ 20% (6 of 101 patients, 6%) (P <.0001). In a subgroup analysis of patients who had had lobectomy, corresponding incidences of RP were as follows: high risk, 20 of 59 (34%); intermediate risk, 5 of 22 (23%); and low risk, 6 of 70 (9%) (P =.001). Conclusions: The lung dose-volume variables V10 and V20 predicted risk of grade ≥2 RP among patients who underwent PORT for NSCLC."
"Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxamide derivatives for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  2018No new and effective treatments have been approved for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the past decade. Cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil are the most commonly used drugs for this disease. In order to develop a new class of drugs effective in our ESCC phenotypic screens, we began a systematic approach to generate novel compounds based on the 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-4-carboxamide fragment. Herein, we report on the synthesis and initial assessment of 55 new analogues in two ESCC cell lines. Some of the active analogues with IC50 values around 10 μM were tested in three additional cell lines. Our structure-activity relationships revealed remarkable alterations in the anti proliferative activities upon modest chemical modifications and autophagy modulation is a suggested mechanism of action."
"Effect of the exposed ceria morphology on the catalytic activity of gold/ceria catalysts for the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide  2018 Elsevier B.V.Ceria (CeO2) with different crystal-planes were used as supports to synthesize gold (Au)/CeO2 catalysts for the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). A CeO2 morphology-dependent Au-CeO2 interaction was observed. Au/CeO2-R in this present work performed the outstanding activity at lower temperature than ever since other works were reported. The Au catalyst supported on rod-shaped CeO2 exhibited the highest CO conversion level of 97.9% at 30 °C, followed by that on polyhedral- (94.0%), cube- (74.0%) and octahedral- (27.7%) shaped CeO2. The catalytic activities were strongly affected by the CeO2 crystal-planes and Au active species. The rod-shaped CeO2 enclosed by (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) planes might interact strongly with Au species, generating the most accessible active sites to absorb/desorb and activate the CO and oxygen molecules. The octahedral-shaped CeO2 enclosed by the (1 1 1) plane had the lowest catalytic activity since the (1 1 1) plane is the most stable and irreducible of the CeO2 (1 1 1), (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) planes, accounting for its decreased catalytic activity."
"A new DNA sensor design for the simultaneous detection of HPV type 16 and 18 DNA  2018In this work, we designed and fabricated two new “signal-on” electrochemical DNA sensors based on a sandwich-hybridization employing pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid probes. The sensors comprised of a capture PNA probe (P1) immobilized on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) and an anthraquinone-labeled signaling probe (AQ-P2) designed to be partially complementary to the target DNA either at upstream (ASU) or downstream (ASD) positions on the DNA sequence hybridized to the P1 probe. In the presence of the DNA target, the ASD sensor showed a higher signal response when compared to the ASU sensor. The ASD sensor was then applied to simultaneously detect two high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences. The target DNA was detected in the range of 0.5–100 nM, and the limits of detection (LODs) of 150 and 153 pM (3SDblank/slope) were obtained for HPV types 16 and 18, respectively. This developed sensor was successfully applied to detect a PCR-amplified sample derived from HPV type 16 (SiHa) and 18 (HeLa) positive human cancer cell lines. These findings are relevant for designing effective sensors, and the developed sensor can be readily applied to detect a wide range of DNA targets."
"An on-site measurement coupled CFD based approach for wind resource assessment over complex terrains  2018 IEEE.Wind resource assessment, especially for regions with complex terrain, is one of the most essential topics for wind energy development. In this paper, a novel method based on on-site measurement coupled to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is proposed to reproduce the spatial variability of wind speed distribution over the region with complex terrain. The on-site measurement data of wind speeds are adopted in the data fusion for wind speed distribution estimation and reproduction, combined with the simulation results of CFD. Next, a case study on wind resource assessment for a wind farm in complex terrain, located in Hebei Province, China was done. One year wind measurements with anemometers on three different sites were performed adopting the proposed approach. A cross-validation of the results of the proposed method against on-site wind speed measurement data indicates a good agreement. The results show that the approach proposed have reproduced a wind resource map with high resolution and the wind speed estimations for one spot within the wind farm are with a root-mean-square error of 0.399 m/s, which is qualified for wind farm planning in complex terrain."
"Nuclear modification factor of D0 mesons in PbPb collisions at sNN=5.02TeV  2018 The Author(s)The transverse momentum (pT) spectrum of prompt D0 mesons and their antiparticles has been measured via the hadronic decay channels D0→K−π+ and D‾0→K+π− in pp and PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair with the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurement is performed in the D0 meson pT range of 2–100GeV/c and in the rapidity range of |y|<1. The pp (PbPb) dataset used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 27.4 pb−1 (530 μb−1). The measured D0 meson pT spectrum in pp collisions is well described by perturbative QCD calculations. The nuclear modification factor, comparing D0 meson yields in PbPb and pp collisions, was extracted for both minimum-bias and the 10% most central PbPb interactions. For central events, the D0 meson yield in the PbPb collisions is suppressed by a factor of 5–6 compared to the pp reference in the pT range of 6–10GeV/c. For D0 mesons in the high-pT range of 60–100GeV/c, a significantly smaller suppression is observed. The results are also compared to theoretical calculations."
"Search for new physics in events with two soft oppositely charged leptons and missing transverse momentum in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The Author(s)A search is presented for new physics in events with two low-momentum, oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons) and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data collected using the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1. The observed event yields are consistent with the expectations from the standard model. The results are interpreted in terms of pair production of charginos and neutralinos (χ˜1 ± and χ˜2 0) with nearly degenerate masses, as expected in natural supersymmetry models with light higgsinos, as well as in terms of the pair production of top squarks (t˜), when the lightest neutralino and the top squark have similar masses. At 95% confidence level, wino-like χ˜1 ±/χ˜2 0 masses are excluded up to 230 GeV for a mass difference of 20 GeV relative to the lightest neutralino. In the higgsino-like model, masses are excluded up to 168 GeV for the same mass difference. For t˜ pair production, top squark masses up to 450 GeV are excluded for a mass difference of 40 GeV relative to the lightest neutralino."
An approximate analytical solution of the two-dimensional KdV-burgers equation by the homotopy analysis method  2018 IEEE.This paper applies the homotopy analysis method to obtain an approximate analytical solution of the two-dimensional Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation. It is found that the homotopy analysis method gives more accurate results on a larger domain than previous results obtained from the Adomian decomposition method.
"Helicobacter pylori infection increased anti-dsDNA and enhanced lupus severity in symptomatic FcγRIIb-deficient lupus mice  2018 Surawut, Panpetch, Makjaroen, Tangtanatakul, Thim-Uam, Wongphoom, Tumwasorn and Leelahavanichkul.The defect on Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIb), the only inhibitory FcγR, has been identified as one of the genetic factors increasing susceptibility to lupus. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) and FcγRIIb dysfunction-polymorphisms are high among Asians, and their co-existence is possible. Unfortunately, the influence of HP against lupus progression in patients with lupus is still controversial. In this study, the interactions between these conditions were tested with HP infection in 24-week-old FcγRIIb-/- mice (symptomatic lupus). HP induced failure to thrive, increased stomach bacterial burdens and stomach injury (histology and cytokines) in both wild-type and FcγRIIb-/- mice. While the severity of HP infection, as determined by these parameters, was not different between both strains, antibodies production (anti-HP, anti-dsDNA and serum gammaglobulin) were higher in FcγRIIb-/- mice compared to wild-type. Accordingly, HP infection also accelerated the severity of lupus as determined by proteinuria, serum creatinine, serum cytokines, renal histology, and renal immune complex deposition. Although HP increased serum cytokines in both wild-type and FcγRIIb-/- mice, the levels were higher in FcγRIIb-/- mice. As such, HP also increased spleen weight and induced several splenic immune cells responsible for antibody productions (activated B cell, plasma cell and follicular helper T cell) in FcγRIIb-/- mice, but not in wild-type. These data describe the different systemic responses against localized HP infection from diverse host genetic background. In conclusion, the mutual interactions between HP and lupus manifestations of FcγRIIb-/-mice were demonstrated in this study. With the prominent immune responses from the loss of inhibitory signaling in FcγRIIb-/- mice, HP infection in these mice induced intense chronic inflammation, increased antibody production, and enhanced lupus severity. Thus, the increased systemic inflammatory responses due to localized HP inducing gastritis in some patients with lupus may enhance lupus progression. More studies are needed."
"Transformation of the BPMN Design Model into a Colored Petri Net Using the Partitioning Approach  2013 IEEE.Formal verification is a process to ensure that the business process model and notation (BPMN) design model is free of deadlock, livelock, and other undesirable properties that can cause a system crash. Formal verification is a complicated procedure involving model abstraction and model checking tools used for property checking. There are several existing transformation techniques that yield an abstract model, but the data perspective is not considered. These techniques are also inappropriate for the large-scale BPMN design model. An automated transformation can reduce the flaws, time consumption, and complexity of the large-scale BPMN design model. This paper proposes a transformation technique and provides a framework for transforming the BPMN design models into colored Petri nets (CPNs). Our techniques cover both the control-flow and data-flow perspectives. The partitioning technique of the BPMN design model is applied to reduce the complexity and leads to a CPN model that can support the hierarchical and compositional verification techniques that are suitable for the large-scale BPMN design models. The proposed transformation has been implemented as a transformation framework and is able to consistently transform the BPMN design models into CPN models."
"A simplified scoring system in de novo follicular lymphoma treated initially with immunochemotherapy  2018 by The American Society of HematologyIn follicular lymphoma (FL), no prognostic index has been built based solely on a cohort of patients treated with initial immunochemotherapy. There is currently a need to define parsimonious clinical models for trial stratification and to add on biomolecular factors. Here, we confirmed the validity of both the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) and the FLIPI2 in the large prospective PRIMA trial cohort of 1135 patients treated with initial R-chemotherapy 6 R maintenance. Furthermore, we developed a new prognostic tool comprising only 2 simple parameters (bone marrow involvement and b2-microglobulin [b2m]) to predict progression-free survival (PFS). The final simplified score, called the PRIMA-PI (PRIMA-prognostic index), comprised 3 risk categories: high (b2m > 3 mg/L), low (b2m £ 3 mg/L without bone marrow involvement), and intermediate (b2m £ 3 mg/L with bone marrow involvement). Five-year PFS rates were 69%, 55%, and 37% in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (P < .0001). In addition, achieving event-free survival (EFS) or not at 24 months (EFS24) was a strong posttreatment prognostic parameter for subsequent overall survival, and the PRIMA-PI was correlated with EFS24. The results were confirmed in a pooled external validation cohort of 479 patients from the FL2000 LYSA trial and the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence Molecular Epidemiology Resource. Five-year EFS in the validation cohort was 77%, 57%, and 44% in the PRIMA-PI low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (P < .0001). The PRIMA-PI is a novel and easy-to-compute prognostic index for patients initially treated with immunochemotherapy. This could serve as a basis for building more sophisticated and integrated biomolecular scores."
"Photolysis of glutaraldehyde in brine: A showcase study for removal of a common biocide in oil and gas produced water  2018 Elsevier B.V.Glutaraldehyde (GA) has been used extensively as a biocide in hydraulic fracturing fluid leading to its presence in oil and gas produced water. In this study, photolysis was used to degrade GA from brine solutions simulating produced water. Photolysis of GA was performed under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. GA can be photolyzed by UV at all studied conditions with the efficiency ranging from 52 to 85% within one hour irradiation. Photolysis of GA followed pseudo-first order kinetics. A photolysis rate constant of GA at 0.1 mM in 200 g/L of salt at pH 7 was 0.0269 min−1 with a quantum yield of 0.0549 under 224 W illumination. The degradation rate of GA increased with increasing incident light intensity and decreasing pH. Increasing initial GA concentration resulted in decreasing degradation rate of GA. The degradation of GA was affected by salt concentration. At lower salt concentrations, notable retardation of GA photodegradation rate was observed while at higher salt concentrations GA photodegradation was improved compared to those without salt. OH was more dominant in sample without salt than sample with salt suggesting different photolytic mechanisms, indirect and direct photolysis, respectively. Oligomers were identified as the main photoproducts of GA photolysis."
"Crystal structures, spectroscopic characterization, and Hirshfeld surface analyses of three constrained cyclam compounds with perchlorate counteranions  2018 Elsevier B.V.Three constrained cyclam compounds with perchlorate anions, 3,14-diethyl-2,6,13,17-diazadiazoniatricyclo[16.4.0.07,12]docosa-2,13-diene diperchlorate [H2L1](ClO4)2 (1), 3,14-diethyl-2,13-diaza-6,17-diazoniatricyclo(16.4.0.07,12)docosane [H2L2](ClO4)2 (2), and bis(3,14-diethyl-2,6,13,17-tetraazatricyclo(16.4.0.07,12)docosane) di(sodium perchlorate) (L2)2·2NaClO4 (3), have been characterized by elemental analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, as well as IR, Raman, and NMR spectroscopy. The asymmetric units of compounds 1 and 2 contain one half dication of [H2L1]2+ or [H2L2]2+ and one perchlorate anion, whereas the asymmetric unit of compound 3 comprises two free L2 molecules, two sodium cations, and two perchlorate anions. The ClO4− ions in 1 and 2 are doubly disordered about a noncrystallographic local threefold axis, and the two ClO4− ions in 3 are fully occupied, although distorted by interactions with adjacent Na+ ions and ligand NH groups. In 1 and 2, the crystals are stabilized by 3D networks of N–H⋯O and N–H⋯N hydrogen bonds, whereas the crystal structure of 3 is maintained by N–H⋯N hydrogen bonds and Na+⋯O/N ion-dipole interactions. Hirshfeld surface analyses with 2D fingerprint plots reveal that the H⋯H and O⋯H interactions are the main intermolecular interactions."
"Impacts of land-use changes on watershed discharge and water quality in a large intensive agricultural area in Thailand  2018,  2018 IAHS.The objectives of this research were to evaluate the effect of land-use change on streamflow, sediment and water quality data along the Lower Yom River, Thailand, covering an intensively agricultural area of 14 613.6 km2, and to assess the relative impact of point and non-point sources of pollution from multiple-land-use watersheds. Long-term calibration and validation of the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was performed on data for 2000–2013. Land-use change led to a 13–49% increase in runoff in the basin and resulted in 37–427% increased sediment yield. The amount of NO3-N load doubled in the upper and middle parts of the study area, while the increase in PO4 3– ranged from 37 to 377%, reflecting the increase in agricultural lands and urban areas. It is concluded that the changed land use is closely associated with the quantity of runoff, sediment yield and the NO3-N and PO4 3– concentrations."
"Diverted total synthesis of melodorinol analogues and evaluation of their cytotoxicity  2018A series of melodorinol analogues were synthesized via a diverted total synthesis approach, leading to structural modifications on several regions of the molecule. Their cytotoxicity was evaluated against five human cancer cell lines (KB, HeLa-S3, MCF-7, HT-29 and A549). Structure-activity relationship studies revealed key parameters that affect the cytotoxicity. In particular, the novel 4-bromo-furanone analogues exhibited greater cytotoxicity compared to the corresponding non-brominated analogues. The stereochemistry at C-6 and the nature of acyl substituents on the C-6 and C-7 hydroxyl groups also play an important role. The most potent analogues exhibit approximately 15-fold higher cytotoxicity towards KB and HeLa-S3 than melodorinol and also show exceptionally high potency against MCF-7, HT-29 and A549 cell lines."

"Substance use, anxiety, and self-management efficacy in HIV-positive individuals: A mediation analysis  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Context: In China, the social stigma of both substance use and HIV remains major barrier. HIV-positive individuals have been demonstrated to have higher psychosocial distress in the literature. To ensure quality of life among HIV-positive Chinese individuals, self-efficacy in HIV-related management including substance use and anxiety is the key to suppress viral load and maintain healthy lives. Objectives: We examine the mediation relationship among substance use, anxiety, and self-management efficacy. Method: A cross-sectional study design was used. In total, 137 HIV-positive individuals were recruited from two premier Chinese hospitals: Beijing’s Ditan Hospital and Shanghai’s Public Health Clinic Center (SPHCC). Results: HIV-positive substance users had significantly lower HIV-management efficacy and higher anxiety scores. About a third of the relations between substance use and anxiety were mediated by HIV-management self-efficacy. Those who used substances in the previous week had higher anxiety levels suggesting the presence of a recency effect. Their higher levels of anxiety could be largely explained by their lower HIV-management efficacy. Conclusion: It is useful for healthcare providers to assess substance use behaviors in HIV-positive individuals as well as provide support in managing anxiety in this population. Meanwhile, enhancing self-management efficacy to ensure healthy lifestyles may support achieving optimal lives with HIV."
"Polydrug use among kratom users: Findings from the 2011 Thailand National Household Survey  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Despite the availability of numerous anecdotal reports of polydrug use in kratom users, few studies have been carried out in Thailand. This study aimed to explore the problem of polydrug use among Thai kratom users. A national household survey on the prevalence of substance use was conducted in 2011 using a multistage random sampling technique. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The frequency of other substance use was compared between respondents with and without a history of kratom use. Of the total sample (18,457), 544 (2.9%) acknowledged kratom use. Eighty-nine (46.1%) used it almost every day. The mean age of users (SD) was 42.7 (12.8) years old, 459 (84.4%) were male, and 264 (48.5%) had used other illicit drugs in the past. Kratom users were significantly more likely to use heroin, ecstasy, and ice with adjusted odds ratios of 39.7, 30.5, and 29.1, respectively. Of 195 who acknowledged kratom use in the past 12 months, 22 (11.3%) concurrently used other illicit drugs, including cannabis, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATSs), and inhalants. Polydrug use is common in Thai kratom users who are more likely to use opiates and ATSs in their lifetime. Another drug concurrently used was cannabis. Health personnel need to be aware of polydrug use in this population."
"Development of highly soluble perylenetetracarboxylic diimide derivative for n-type monolayer field-effect-transistor  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.We have employed 1,7-dibromo-N,N’-ditridecyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetra carboxylic diimide (DB-PTCDI-C13) for the development of novel n-type monolayer field-effect-transistor (FET). Functionalization of PTCDI core with long alkyl chain and bulky bromine atoms improved the solubility and made n-type monolayer FET performance possible via solution deposition processes. Annealing effect of spin coated films and drop casted films have been discussed. Liquid crystalline phase of DB-PTCDI-C13 turned out to be playing an important role in controlling the film quality and mobility. The highest mobility was 5.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing, of which device has been then tested for doping by potassium."
"The long reach of English law: A case of incidental transplantation of the English law concept of vicarious liability into Thailand’s civil and commercial code  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Thailand’s Civil and Commercial Code, introduced in 1925, represents a voluntary major legal transplantation by which Thailand adopted a complete new code based on foreign models. This article traces the development of Section 425, which confers liability on employers vicariously for the wrongful acts of their employees, and reveals that the concepts present in the stated sources of the provision do not match those represented by the section in its final form. Rather, the concepts hint at another source, unstated and hitherto uncredited as a source of this part of the Code, the English law doctrine of vicarious liability. This conclusion sheds new light on the complex process of legal transplantation and legal reform in Thailand during the early twentieth century, challenging the orthodox view, and has wider implications for those considering the societal factors which guide and shape legal reform."
"Structural properties of lattice-matched IngaPN on GaAs (001)  P. SRITONWONG, S. SANORPIM, K. ONABE, 2018.Structural properties of lattice-matched InGaPN on GaAs (001) have comprehensively investigated by high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD), Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The InGaPN layers were grown by metal organics vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). To obtain the lattice-matched InGaPN on GaAs, flow rates of trimethylindium (TMIn), trimethylgallium (TMGa) were kept, respectively, at 14.7 and 8.6/umol/min. On the other hand, the N content optimized by varying the flow rate of dimethyhydrazine (DMHy, N precursor) was controlled at 300/umol/min. With a combination of HRXRD and Raman scattering measurements, the In and N contents are estimated to be 55.8 and 0.9 at%, respectively. The lattice-mismatch lower than 0.47%, which corresponds to the lattice-matching condition, was confirmed for all the layers. The rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process was performed to improvement the crystalline quality of InGaPN layers. The annealing temperature was fixed at 650∘C, which is an optimum growth temperature of a GaAs buffer layer. The annealing time was varied in a range of 30 to 180 s to verify a composition uniformity. With increasing the annealing time up to 120 s, the In and N contents were slightly increased. The AFM-root mean square (RMS) roughness of the InGaPN surface was observed to be reduced. For higher annealing times, the N content was dramatically reduced, whereas the In content was still remained. Moreover, the RMS roughness was observed to be increased. RTA at 650∘C for 120 s demonstrated a significant improvement of structural properties of the lattice-matched InGaPN layers on GaAs (001)."
"Analysis of reversed L-loops as closing loops with anterior intrusive force  2018,  2018 British Orthodontic Society.Objective: Intrusive forces on anterior brackets are preferable for avoiding overbite deepening. Reversing plain L-loops may create such advantageous force system during space closure. Design: Force systems of reversed L-loops were compared with T-loops at three interbracket distances (IBD). Setting: Computational study. Methods: Using finite element analysis, loop response during simulated loop-pulling was determined for plain reversed L- and T-loop configurations at three IBDs and two sizes. Force systems were calculated on both loop ends for two activation forces. Results: The 12 mm IBD reversed L-loops had almost equal M/F ratios in opposite directions at both ends. A small intrusive force was found at the canine bracket (CB). The 6 mm IBD reversed L-loops showed larger M/F ratios and extrusive forces at the premolar bracket (PB) and smaller M/F with intrusive forces at CB. The force system of 12 mm IBD T-loops showed the similar force systems as off-centered V-bends with extrusive force at CB, whilst plain 6 mm IBD T-loops showed properties similar to centered V-bends with less extrusive force at CB. Conclusions: Reversed L closing loops placed no extrusive force on the CB end at various IBDs, indicating that reversed loops will generate an intrusive force at anterior teeth during space closure."

"Evaluation of liner responses due to non-uniform tail void grouting pressure  2018,  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Tail void grouting initially does facilitate the action of ground loads around the lower half of the liner and no excess pressure being accumulated. However, at a later stage (almost at the completion of grouting), grout pressure becomes non-uniformly distributed around grout injection holes especially on the upper half of the liner. In the present study, the boundary and loading conditions were simulated by using a series of finite element analyses. It aimed to explore the effects of such temporary non-uniform loading conditions on development of the liner internal forces. The results obtained for tunnel with diameter of 6.0 m were presented. It was found that there were critical locations where application of non-uniform grouting pressure could result in large amounts of bending moment and deformation. Those critical locations; about ±30° to ±50° from crown of the tunnel, were about the locations where actual grouting was injected in the field. The stiffness of sub-soil beneath the tunnel invert had minor effect on the amount of induced structural forces. However, ground coverage was more important. The results, though cannot fully represent complicated tail grouting behaviours, provided a simple analytical procedure for exploring the effects of tail void grouting on the segmental liner."
"Life-cycle reliability assessment of reinforced concrete bridges under multiple hazards  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper proposes a novel probabilistic methodology for estimating the life-cycle reliability of existing reinforced concrete (RC) bridges under multiple hazards. The life-cycle reliability of an RC bridge pier under seismic and airborne chloride hazards is compared to that of a bridge girder under traffic and airborne chloride hazards. When conducting a life-cycle reliability assessment of existing RC bridges, observational data from inspections can provide the corrosion level in reinforcement steel. Random variables related with the prediction of time-variant steel weight loss can be updated based on the inspection results using Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation (SMCS). This paper presents a novel procedure for identifying the hazards that most threaten the structural safety of existing RC bridges, as well as the structural components with the lowest reliability when these bridges are exposed to multiple hazards. The proposed approach, using inspection results associated with steel weight loss, provides a rational reliability assessment framework that allows comparison between the life-cycle reliabilities of bridge components under multiple hazards, helping the prioritisation of maintenance actions. The effect of the number of inspection locations on the updated reliability is considered by incorporating the spatial steel corrosion distribution. An illustrative example is provided of applying the proposed life-cyle reliability assessment to a hypothetical RC bridge under multiple hazards."

The in vitro release for DEX-Ac nanoparticles showed an initial burst release followed by a continuous slower release, whereas DEX-P nanoparticles showed only rapid initial release behavior."
"Repeatability of electromyography normalization of the neck and shoulder muscles in symptomatic office workers  2017,  2017 Central Institute for Labour Protection & National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).Purpose. The purpose of the study was to examine the repeatability of electromyography (EMG) normalization in office workers with neck and shoulder symptoms. Methods. Fifteen female office workers with neck/shoulder symptoms were recruited to participate in two separate days of testing. Maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was used for the normalization of EMG data on the following muscles: cervical erector spinae, upper trapezius, lower trapezius and anterior deltoid. Repeatability was calculated using the intra-class correlation (ICC), relative standard error of measurement (%SEM) and relative coefficient of variation (%CV). Results. Peak root mean square (rms) and median frequency (MF) showed good to high repeatability in the UT, AD and CES (ICC = 0.87–0.95, %SEM= 2.65–9.48, %CV= 0.2–5.9). The repeatability of peak rms was good (ICC = 0.87, %SEM = 12.56, %CV = 3.3) and the MF of the LT was fair (ICC = 0.76, %SEM = 5.71, %CV = 2.9). Conclusion. Peak rms and MF from the MVIC normalization method can be measured with sufficient repeatability in symptomatic office workers."
"A study of students' experiences toward the university self-developed social learning management system: MyCourseVille the case of chulalongkorn university, thailand  2018 IEEE.Chulalongkorn University has developed its own Learning Management System (LMS) named myCourseVille which will be used to enhance students learning experience. myCourseVille contains many similar features that are comparable to other existing LMS, such as Blackboard (Bb).

"Classifying attitudes of thai business organizations toward the perceived benefit of customer predictive analytics  2018 IEEE.In this paper, we applied K-means++, Agglomerative and Decision Tree techniques to classify characteristics of Thai business organizations toward the perceived benefit of predictive analytics. We believe that different characteristics of business organizations require different solution approaches to overcome challenges and gain business value. In the exploratory survey, we collected 84 respondents, who are data analysts, business analysts, business owners, management, and IT managers. The respondents' size of organization varies from small firms to large firms. The result from three techniques of classification shows that Thai business organizations perceiving the benefit of predictive analytics could be divided into two groups. We further confirmed that with the analysis of variance technique to identify the difference of means in each parameter. We also found that the most important descriptive profile is led by customer-related factors such as a change in the percentage of customers, the number of direct customers, and number of sales and marketing staff. These are followed by technology factors, which are the number of external and internal data sources and number of analytics and technologies currently used for data analytics."

"The Realistic Approximation on Equivalent Attractive Radius of Lightning Strikes  2018 IEEE.During the past few decades, the equivalent attractive radius (R-{ao}(h)) of lightning strike has become an improper integral term, which can hardly determine the result when implemented. Therefore, this paper proposes an approximate equation of equivalent attractive radius in a simplified term. This will be investigated through a Generic model (GM) of a vertical conducting rod. Moreover, the result of this equation will be compared focusing on accuracy with the high correctness solution of numerical calculation, such as the midpoint method. As a result, these should be equivalent due to the absolute error of no more than one percent. Furthermore, the result of R-{ao}(h) through this equation, can be analyzed by the number of strikes per year (Ns), which corresponds with the actual experimental data. Also, the approximate equation in this paper is appropriately utilized to be practical. Finally, correlation of the approximate equation will analyze R-{ao}(h) and Ns of a tall building, namely the Khema-pirataram temple, to evaluate the risk due to lightning flashes to the top of the structure."

We therefore attempt to clarify the uncertainty. Using the Tobii eye tracker to record fixation activities of 312 participants while filling in online forms with three label alignment formats (i.e., left, top, and infield) confirmed that the participants noticed the left-aligned label fastest as compared to the other alignment formats. Nonetheless, based on the fixation analysis, the top or the infield alignments still outrank the left one. In addition to extending insight into the label alignments on online forms, practitioners may apply the findings so visitors to the forms could work efficiently."
"HMM-based Thai singing voice synthesis system  2018 IEEE.Singing synthesis in each language has its unique characteristics and challenges aiming to improve its naturalness. One of the challenges that tonal language singing synthesis specifically faces is melisma, which is a syllable with more than two musical notes. This research offers a melisma-compatible singing voice synthesis system. To do so, we propose phoneme duplication methods. The results showed that the proposed phoneme duplication methods made the system compatible with melisma, where short vowels and final consonants constructed a favorable waveform closer to actual singing voice. It also provides higher naturalness as perceived through MOS evaluation. Finally, in order to improve naturalness in the synthesized singing voice, an experiment with HMM state numbers was conducted. The outcome demonstrated that the naturalness increased as the state numbers grew to a certain point."
"Computation of three-finger grasping plane  2018 IEEE.Empowering a robot with ability to grasp has been a long dream in robotics. Despite serious research effort over many decades, even the most advanced robots still struggle in the area of grasping. The main challenge is how to deal with errors and uncertainty. In grasp planning, traditional methods such as ICR and caging deal with the uncertainty problem at the contact level and suffer the poor performances. This paper explores a more global outlook by aiming at finding a promising grasping plane (instead of individual points) to place the three contact points. The paper presents a heuristic method to find a plane through the object to place the three finger contact. The input of the method is the input mesh model of the object. Physical experiment is also presented to show the effectiveness of the method."
"A web-based active learning conceptual framework for innovative business plan creation : ddeveloping new tools for entrepreneurship education  2018 IEEE.This research aims to develop a framework for writing a business plan that support innovation for undergraduate students. The scope of this research is circumscribed to undergraduate students in Thailand. In respect of internet technology advancement and the popularity of internet access of teenagers, the researcher employs e-learning instruction media, which is considered a keystone to reduce educational inequalities. The study particularly introduces an established Nanoka's knowledge creation concept, which consists of Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation. In earlier times, this concept has been verified to create the domain of innovation in business organisation. Remarkably, it has been employed in the process of teaching innovative business plans and creativity management. This process specifically incorporates active learning, which turns the passive role of merely listening to active learners. The framework offers three principal contributions: first, to develop a new educational platform that implements active learning into E-Learning styles; second, to develop of an uncommon conceptual framework that adheres to theory reflecting good practices for innovation creation; third, taking this concept into practice, to help the universities build upon core strengths and students' innovation skills. It is the confluence of all contributions that make for a full-fledged entrepreneurial university."

"A Preliminary Study on Fundamental Thai NLP Tasks for User-generated Web Content  2018 IEEE.Existing literature on Thai NLP often focuses on formally written texts with near-perfect spellings and boundaries between words or sentences. Such assumptions, however, do not hold in real-world NLP tasks, especially when dealing with User-generated web content (UGWC). So far, existing NLP research works on actual web data have been limited, making it unclear whether and how existing techniques can be applicable to UGWC. In this paper, several basic Thai NLP algorithms (word segmentation, sentence segmentation, word error detection, word variant detection, name entity recognition) are re-investigated and benchmarked against real-world, practical UGWC data set. The difference in performance between our data set and others are compared as a guidance for future research. Our baseline sentence segmentation on UGWC data set yields an average F-measure of 0.77. For name entity recognition and word variant / error detection tasks, our system yields the accuracy of 0.93 and 0.53, respectively."

"Purification and upgrading from biogas to biomethane  2018 Japan Institute of Energy. All rights reserved.Biomethane could be upgraded from biogas to increase its heating value, avoid corrosion and eliminate toxicity. The simplest and most common technique for upgrading biogas is absorption process. In this study, two processes between water scrubbing and chemical scrubbing with diethanolamine (DEA) solution integrated with regeneration and recirculation are compared through Aspen Plus simulations. The aim of this study is to find the suitable operational condition in absorption process in order to increase the efficiency of the process in recovery methane and to decrease the energy consumption in the system. Our model was developed by including one additional absorber unit. Results show that the systems, both water scrubbing and chemical scrubbing, can achieve high purity of biomethane of >96 %v/v. In comparison between models for water scrubbing, our proposed system offers higher recovery methane of 4.68% of and 7,863.07 kW of energy of biomethane. In chemical scrubbing process, our system was able to decrease the pressure of absorber from 55.2 to 10 bar. Consequently, the recovery methane and energy of biomethane were increased while the energy consumption of system was decreased."
"Diffuse endobronchial metastasis from sigmoid carcinoma presenting as wheezing and respiratory failure  2018 The Authors.A 66-year-old Thai man with underlying asthma, history of traumatic right haemothorax, and sigmoid carcinoma with bladder invasion developed productive cough, whitish sputum, dyspnoea, and wheezing for 2 months. Physical examination showed generalized expiratory wheezing in both lungs. Computed tomography scan of the chest revealed diffuse thickening of bronchial wall, predominantly at lower lobes; several various sizes of pulmonary nodules; diffuse interlobular septal thickening; multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and hilar lymph nodes; and right pleural effusion. The patient was intubated for respiratory failure with persistent wheezing and, subsequently, with difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopy was performed, which revealed diffuse multiple small mucosal nodules in both lungs. Pathology of the nodules showed foci of adeno-carcinoma. Positive immunochemical staining with CDX2 confirmed the diagnosis of endobronchial metastasis of sigmoid carcinoma. This case highlighted a rare presentation of endobronchial metastasis from sigmoid carcinoma with persistent wheezing, respiratory failure, and difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation."
"Effect of preloaded ferrocene in Co-pyrolysis of kerosene/ferrocene on CNT synthesis  2018 Japan Institute of Energy. All rights reserved.Based on elemental analyses, slop oil which is typical petroleum waste could be represented by kerosene according to the major content of hydrocarbons containing 8-15 of carbon atoms. It was found that co-pyrolysis of mixture of kerosene and ferrocene with a certain amount of ferrocene preloaded into a quartz tube reactor could result in formation of carbon nanotubes with uniform morphology and substantial yield. Based on thermogravimetric and SEM analyses, it was found that typical sample of CNTs synthesized with a designated weight ratio of ferrocene mixed with kerosene and preloaded ferrocene of 1:1 exhibited better thermal stability and more uniform morphology with an average diameter of less than 100 nm."

"Structural Neuroimaging and Neuropsychologic Signatures in Children With Vertically Acquired HIV Copyright  2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Background: Children with vertically acquired HIV exhibit persistent cognitive impairments, yet the corresponding neuroimaging signature of vertical infection remains unclear. Methods: Fifty healthy control children and 51 vertically infected children were included in the study. The HIV-infected group consisted of survivors who had not received antiretroviral therapy at birth. The HIV-infected group averaged 11.4 (2.5) years of age, with a median CD4 count of 683 cells/mm3. Most (71%) of the HIV-infected children were on antiretroviral therapy for a median of 34 months (range: 33–42) with HIV RNA <40 copies/mL in 89% of the sample. The HIV-uninfected group averaged 10.6 (2.6) years of age. Magnetic resonance imaging was acquired to determine volumes of the caudate, putamen, thalamus, pallidum, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, total white matter, total gray matter and cortical gray matter. Correlational analyses examined the degree of shared variance between brain volumes and both cognitive performances and laboratory markers of disease activity (T cells and plasma viral load). Results: HIV-infected children exhibited larger volumes of the caudate, nucleus accumbens, total gray matter and cortical gray matter when compared with the controls. Volumetric differences were predominately evident in children under 12 years of age. HIV-infected children performed worse than controls on most neuropsychologic tests, though neither cognitive performances nor laboratory markers corresponded to brain volumes in the HIV-infected children. Conclusions: Outcomes of the present study suggest abnormal brain maturation among HIV-infected pediatric survivors. Longitudinal studies of brain integrity and related resilience factors are needed to determine the impact of neuroimaging abnormalities on psychosocial function in pediatric HIV."

"Influence of clitoria ternatea flower extract on the in vitro enzymatic digestibility of starch and its application in bread  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).This study aimed to assess the effect of the Clitoria ternatea L. flower extract (CTE), on the inhibition of pancreatic α-amylase, in vitro starch hydrolysis, and predicted the glycemic index of different type of flours including potato, cassava, rice, corn, wheat, and glutinous rice flour. The application in a bakery product prepared from flour and CTE was also determined. The results demonstrated that the 1% and 2% (w/v) CTE inhibited the pancreatic α-amylase activity by using all flours as a substrate. Moreover, 0.5%, 1%, and 2% (w/v) CTE showed a significant reduction in the glucose release, hydrolysis index (HI), and predicted glycemic index (pGI) of flour. In glutinous rice flour, 1% and 2% (w/v) CTE had a significantly lower level of rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS) with a concomitant higher level of undigested starch. The statistical analysis demonstrated strong positive significant correlations between the percentage of CTE and the undigested starch of wheat and cassava. The addition of 5%, 10%, and 20% (w/w) CTE significantly reduced the rate of starch digestion of the wheat bread. The pGI of bread incorporated with 5% CTE (w/w) was significantly lower than that of the control bread. Our findings suggest that CTE could reduce the starch digestibility, the HI, and pGI of flour through the inhibition of carbohydrate digestive enzymes. Taken together, CTE may be a potent ingredient for the reduced glycemic index of flours."
"Present and Future Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Animals: Principles and Practices  2018 American Society for Microbiology. All rights reserved.There is broad consensus internationally that surveillance of the levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurring in various systems underpins strategies to address the issue. The key reasons for surveillance of resistance are to determine (i) the size of the problem, (ii) whether resistance is increasing, (iii) whether previously unknown types of resistance are emerging, (iv) whether a particular type of resistance is spreading, and (v) whether a particular type of resistance is associated with a particular outbreak. The implications of acquiring and utilizing this information need to be considered in the design of a surveillance system. AMR surveillance provides a foundation for assessing the burden of AMR and for providing the necessary evidence for developing efficient and effective control and prevention strategies. The codevelopment of AMR surveillance programs in humans and animals is essential, but there remain several key elements that make data comparisons between AMR monitoring programs, and between regions, difficult. Currently, AMR surveillance relies on uncomplicated in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility methods. However, the lack of harmonization across programs and the limitation of genetic information of AMR remain the major drawbacks of these phenotypic methods. The future of AMR surveillance is moving toward genotypic detection, and molecular analysis methods are expected to yield a wealth of information. However, the expectation that these molecular techniques will surpass phenotypic susceptibility testing in routine diagnosis and monitoring of AMR remains a distant reality, and phenotypic testing remains necessary in the detection of emerging resistant bacteria, new resistance mechanisms, and trends of AMR."
"International school management according to the concept of developing students' global leadership  2018, ABAC Journal.This research aimed to 1) explore the proper conceptual framework of international school management according to the concept of developing students' global leadership, and 2) study the current and desirable states of international school management according to the concept of developing students' global leadership. The study applied a mixed-method approach. Samples were obtained from 102 international schools in Thailand. The instruments used in the study were, a validation form for the conceptual framework, and a questionnaire for the current and desirable situations. The data were analysed by frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation. The results showed that the conceptual framework of international school management according to the development of students' global leadership is comprised of 3 areas: international school academic management, including the school's philosophy and guiding statements, curriculum development and implementation, and professional development; development of student's global leadership through environmental conditions, and students' action and; students' global leadership competencies, including competency in forming cross-cultural relationships, interpersonal skills, global traits and values, global thinking and orientation, global business expertise, global organisational expertise, global vision, and being technologically savvy. Regarding the current state of international school management according to the concept of developing students' global leadership it was found that there was good management (high level) in terms of school philosophy and guiding statements, and curriculum development and implementation, but moderate management in terms of professional development. In contrast, the desirable states of international school management according to the concept of developing students' global leadership, were shown to be a high level of management in terms of school philosophy and guiding statements, and professional development, and the highest level in terms of curriculum development and implementation."
"Effects of nickel addition during different phases of solid waste decomposition  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.This study examined the effects of nickel on solid waste decomposition as well as its soluble concentrations during different times of addition. Three landfill reactors, loaded with 20 kg of waste, were used. Leachate recirculation was applied to all reactors, starting from Day 148. Nickel in the form of NiCl2 was added to the acid and methane reactors on Day 152 and 181, respectively. Leachate and gas parameters from all reactors exhibited similar trends during the first 151 days. Cumulative biogas production was356, 269, and 305 L for the control, acid, and methane reactors, respectively, indicating inhibition in the last two. Residence time of nickel in the acid reactor was more than two times that in the methane reactor (179 vs. 71 hours). Shorter residence time of soluble nickel during the methane phase addition may be responsible for better waste decomposition and could be beneficial for field application."
"Self-care behaviors in vietnamese adults with heart failure  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.Self-care is a cornerstone of therapy for adult patients with heart failure to prevent long-term hospital readmission. This study examines the frequency of self-care behaviors and factors related to such behaviors in Vietnamese adults with heart failure. In this cross-sectional study, random sampling was used to recruit 200 heart failure patients from the outpatient departments in 10 hospitals in northern Vietnam. Study variables were selected according to Orem’s theory of self-care. The total mean score for self-care behaviors was moderate, with the lowest mean score being for treatment compliance. Comorbidity, knowledge of heart failure, social support, and barriers to sodium restriction predicted 27.6% of the variance in self-care behaviors. The strongest predictor was barriers to sodium restriction (β=–0.34, p<0.05). The results indicated a need to develop nursing interventions to promote self-care behaviors in this population via modification of the factors identified in this study."
"Preparation of aluminum doped zinc oxide targets and RF magnetron sputter thin films with various aluminum doping concentrations  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.In this work, aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) ceramic targets were prepared from ZnO powder and Al2O3 powder with varying amounts of Al2O3 doped in a range of 1-5 wt%. The mixed ZnO and Al2O3 powders were pressed at a pressure of 80 MPa into disks and sintered at 1,300 ∘C for 5 h in air. The crystal structures of the sintered targets were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. It was found that the XRD spectra showed a hexagonal (wurtzite) structure of ZnO for all Al2O3 doped films. However, as the amount of Al2O3 increased over 2 wt%, the gahnite (ZnAl2O4) phase could be observed in the XRD spectra. The AZO films were deposited on glass slides at room temperature and post-annealed at 500 ∘C in a vacuum for 1 h. The film structures, Al/Zn ratio between the Al and Zn atoms, and the electrical properties were characterized. It was found that an increase of Al2O3 content in the target gave a higher Al doping concentration in the film which resulted in more Al substitutions in the Zn sites which in turn resulted in an increase of carrier concentration. The crystal structure of the AZO films deposited from undoped and 1 wt% Al2O3-doped targets showed the (002) preferred orientation and drastically decreased at higher Al doping concentrations. The mobility of the charge carrier was affected by lower crystallinity due to grain boundary scattering. In addition, the excess Al in the film may play a role as impurity scattering centers. A decrease of Hall mobility resulted in increased resistivity. The minimum resistivity of 2.01x10-3 Ώ.cm could be achieved for the AZO films deposited from 1 wt% Al2O3-doped ZnO targets."
"The fabrication of multicolor electrochromic device based on graphene conductive ink/poly(Lactic acid) thin films by voltage-step method  2018, National Institute of Optoelectronics. All rights reserved.Today’s technology has significantly focused on advanced and smart materials. Electrochromism is a phenomenon wherein the change in optical properties of a material is induced by reversible redox process. Color change usually occurs between colored (darkened) state and transmissive (bleached) states or between two different colored states. In this research, we focused on silver (Ag) nanoparticles that exhibit various colors on the basis of their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The effects of step-voltage parameters on the coloration of the Ag deposition-based electrochromic device were investigated. Further, we report the use of graphene conductive ink (GCI)/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as the transparent conductive electrode (TCE). Biopolymer film was coated with graphene ink by spin coating method. The samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electrical resistance measurements, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Our results primarily indicate that the novel configuration (PLA/GCI/Ag/GCI/PLA) presents an easy and expeditious way of preparing the multicolor electrochromic device."
"Combining geographic information system (GIS) and simulation for crew boat scheduling  2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka. All Rights Reserved.This paper aims to describe how Geographic Information System (GIS) can be combined with simulation to develop crew boat scheduling to transport Offshore Oil and Gas employees from Offshore Living Quarter to different working locations (Remote Platforms) to timely meet operational demands while reducing cost and using minimal resources. The approach is to apply GIS to determine the appropriate routing and scheduling with a different number of vessels that will allow employees to reach the remote platforms on time. GIS suggests that, with the new routing and scheduling, the company can reduce the number of vessels. However, due to uncertainty in a number of employees to be transported to each location and the speed of vessels, it is unclear whether the fleet size and the routing recommended by GIS will still be valid. Therefore, a simulation model is needed to simulate the situation with a variable number of employees to be transported. This allows one to evaluate the fleet size and the routing recommended by GIS to ensure that it still provides an optimal solution in a real-world situation. The simulation result confirms that the company can reduce the number of vessels from 6 to 5 vessels and can still be able to meet the transportation required under the time constraints. The average vessel seating utilization increases from 87.0% to 97.8%. With the new routing and scheduling solution, the company can reduce transportation cost by 47 million baht per year."
"The Public Regime for Migrant Child Education in Thailand: Alternative Depictions of Policy  2018 Policy Studies OrganizationThis article analyzes the conceptualization and depiction of Thailand’s public policy on education for the children of migrant workers in the country by examining a cluster of fairly recent literature on the subject. The studied texts broadly share the view that Thailand’s policy of providing full education to these children is subject to gaps and patchy implementation. An analytical review of the literature on conceptualizing this policy shows, however, that this picture is misleading as it tends to reduce policy to an idealized intention. Rather, Thailand has a plurality of local policies ambiguously governed by a national policy, which in turn does not predominantly aim at education for all. We contend that our improved characterization of the situation helps create more productive openings for research and policy change on this important topic."
"Failed intubation in the perioperative and anesthetic adverse events in Thailand (PAAD thai) study: Perspectives of technical skills and anesthetists’ non-technical skills (ANTS)  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: The Royal College of Anesthesiologists of Thailand (RCAT) has performed the study called “The Perioperative Anesthetic Adverse Events Study in Thailand (PAAd Thai)”. It was a multi-center, prospective, observational trial conducted in 22 hospitals throughout Thailand in 2015. This study is a part of the PAAd Thai which specifically aimed to focus on failed intubation with the view of technical skills and Anesthetists’ Non-Technical Skills (ANTS). Materials and Methods: The PAAd Thai working group created a standardized incident record form. Each incident including failed intubation was reported directly to a center of data management using this form. Two anesthesiologists (SN, PP) separately used the ANTS behavioral rating tool (4 categories, 15 elements) to assess performances of the healthcare providers involved in each incident report of failed intubation. Results: Among 2,206 incident reports, there were 16 cases (0.7%) of failed intubation. Overall incidence per 10,000 with 95% CI was 0.74 (0.38-1.10). More than half of them were not obese. Difficult intubation was predicted in 56.25% of the cases. McIntosh blade was the most frequently used equipment. Five cases were cancelled while 11 went on for surgery using either a laryngeal mask airway (55%) or tracheostomy (45%). The 2 most common complications were hypoxia (43.75%) and esophageal intubation (12.50%). No cardiac arrest happened. With ANTS, there was 0 case which the 2 authors had the same ratings for all elements. Moreover, none of the elements were marked with the same ratings by the 2 authors. Identifying options as well as balancing risks and selecting options (decision making) were rated in concordance for 12 incident reports. Conversely, prioritizing (task management) as well as using authority and assertiveness (team working) accounted for 0 agreement. Conclusion: The incidence of failed intubation was low and no case experienced very serious complications. Using the ANTS scoring system to evaluate performances of anesthetic practitioners from the incident reports showed various agreements between the 2 authors."
"Observation of proton-tagged, central (semi)exclusive production of high-mass lepton pairs in pp collisions at 13 TeV with the CMS-TOTEM precision proton spectrometer  2018, The Author(s).The process pp → pℓ+ℓ−p(*), with ℓ+ℓ− a muon or an electron pair produced at midrapidity with mass larger than 110 GeV, has been observed for the first time at the LHC in pp collisions at s=13 TeV. One of the two scattered protons is measured in the CMS-TOTEM precision proton spectrometer (CT-PPS), which operated for the first time in 2016. The second proton either remains intact or is excited and then dissociates into a low-mass state p*, which is undetected. The measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of 9.4 fb−1 collected during standard, high-luminosity LHC operation. A total of 12 μ+μ− and 8 e+e− pairs with m(ℓ+ℓ−) > 110 GeV, and matching forward proton kinematics, are observed, with expected backgrounds of 1.49 ± 0.07 (stat) ± 0.53 (syst) and 2.36 ± 0.09 (stat) ± 0.47 (syst), respectively. This corresponds to an excess of more than five standard deviations over the expected background. The present result constitutes the first observation of proton-tagged γγ collisions at the electroweak scale. This measurement also demonstrates that CT-PPS performs according to the design specifications.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Investigation of epigenetic regulatory networks associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by integrated global LINE-1 methylation and gene expression profiling analyses  2018 Tangsuwansri et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background The exact cause and mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear. Dysregulation of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) has been reported in the brains of ASD-like mutant mice and ASD brain tissues. However, the role and methylation of LINE-1 in individuals with ASD remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether LINE-1 insertion is associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to assess LINE-1 methylation in ASD. Methods To identify DEGs associated with LINE-1 in ASD, we reanalyzed previously published transcriptome profiles and overlapped them with the list of LINE-1-containing genes from the TranspoGene database. An Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of DEGs associated with LINE-1 insertion was conducted. DNA methylation of LINE-1 was assessed via combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) of lymphoblastoid cell lines from ASD individuals and unaffected individuals, and the methylation levels were correlated with the expression levels of LINE-1 and two LINE-1-inserted DEGs, C1orf27 and ARMC8. Results We found that LINE-1 insertion was significantly associated with DEGs in ASD. The IPA showed that LINE-1-inserted DEGs were associated with ASD-related mechanisms, including sex hormone receptor signaling and axon guidance signaling. Moreover, we observed that the LINE-1 methylation level was significantly reduced in lymphoblastoid cell lines from ASD individuals with severe language impairment and was inversely correlated with the transcript level. The methylation level of LINE-1 was also correlated with the expression of the LINE-1-inserted DEG C1orf27 but not ARMC8. Conclusions In ASD individuals with severe language impairment, LINE-1 methylation was reduced and correlated with the expression levels of LINE-1 and the LINE-1-inserted DEG C1orf27. Our findings highlight the association of LINE-1 with DEGs in ASD blood samples and warrant further investigation. The molecular mechanisms of LINE-1 and the effects of its methylation in ASD pathobiology deserve further study."
"Hypertonic Saline Versus Isotonic Saline Nasal Irrigation: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis  The Author(s) 2018.Background: Saline nasal lavage is one of the treatments of sinonasal diseases. Evidence from basic research favors hypertonic saline (HS) over isotonic saline (IS) for mucociliary clearance, but evidence from clinical studies is controversial. Conversely, HS may carry greater side effects. Objective: To compare the effects of HS and IS nasal irrigation in treating sinonasal diseases. Methods: Systematic search with Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Manual additional sources was conducted. Randomized controlled trials comparing HS with IS nasal irrigation in treating any sinonasal diseases, including rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, were included. Data were pooled for meta-analyses. Outcomes were symptom scores, sinonasal outcome test (SNOT), and adverse events. Heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analyses. Results: Nine studies (740 patients) were included. HS nasal irrigation brought greater benefits over IS in symptom reduction (standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.76, −0.40); however, no difference was shown in SNOT-20 improvement (mean difference 1.81; 95% CI: −0.68, 4.30). In subgroup analyses, effects favoring HS on symptoms were larger in 4 subgroups. These were (1) patients with rhinitis (SMD −1.09; 95% CI: −1.42, −0.76) compared with rhinosinusitis (SMD −0.37; 95% CI: −0.58, −0.15), P <.01; (2) patients under the age of 18 years (SMD −1.22; 95% CI: −1.53, −0.91) compared with patients over the age of 18 years (SMD −0.26; 95% CI: −0.49, −0.04), P <.01; (3) saline irrigation using high volume (SMD −0.89; 95% CI: −1.18, −0.60) compared with low volume (SMD −0.39; 95% CI: −0.62, −0.16), P <.01; and (4) saline irrigation with hypertonicity of <3% (SMD −1.09; 95% CI: −1.42, −0.76) and hypertonicity of 3%–5% (SMD −1.20; 95% CI: −1.61, −0.78) compared with hypertonicity of >5% (SMD 0.20; 95% CI: −0.15, 0.55), P <.01. Buffered saline and operative status did not have impact. HS brought greater minor adverse effects. No major adverse effects were reported. Conclusion: HS improves symptoms over IS nasal irrigation in treating sinonasal diseases. There is no difference in disease-specific quality of life. However, HS brings greater minor side effects than IS."
"Microtensile bond strength between glass ionomer cement and silver diamine fluoride-treated carious primary dentin  2018 American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. All rights reserved.Purpose: The study objectives were to investigate the effect of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) on the microtensile bond strength between glass ionomer cement and carious primary dentin and evaluate the mode of restoration failure. Methods: Forty carious primary molars were sectioned in half through the middle of the carious lesion and randomly allocated to test and control groups. The test specimens were treated with 38 percent SDF, and the control, deionized water. The samples were stored in artificial saliva for 14 days at 37 degrees Celsius, and the dentin surfaces were conditioned and restored with Fuji IX GP Extra. After 24 hours in artificial saliva, the specimens were prepared for microtensile bond strength testing and stressed in tension at one mm per minute until failure. Mean bond strengths were compared using the paired t test. The failure mode was assessed with a stereomicroscope under 40X magnification. Results: The mean microtensile strength for the test group was 7.4 MPa (SD=±5.1) and 6.3 (±4.6) for the control group (P>0.05). Most common failure mode was the mixed failure mode in both groups. Conclusion: Silver diamine fluoride does not adversely affect the bond strength between glass ionomer cement and carious primary dentin in vitro."
"Electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z boson in proton–proton collisions at √s= 13 TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.A measurement of the electroweak (EW) production of two jets in association with a Z boson in proton-proton collisions at s=13TeV is presented, based on data recorded in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb--1. The measurement is performed in the ℓℓjj final state with ℓ including electrons and muons, and the jets j corresponding to the quarks produced in the hard interaction. The measured cross section in a kinematic region defined by invariant masses mℓℓ>50GeV, mjj>120GeV, and transverse momenta pTj>25GeV is σEW(ℓℓjj)=534±20(stat)±57(syst) fb, in agreement with leading-order standard model predictions. The final state is also used to perform a search for anomalous trilinear gauge couplings. No evidence is found and limits on anomalous trilinear gauge couplings associated with dimension-six operators are given in the framework of an effective field theory. The corresponding 95% confidence level intervals are -2.6<cWWW/Λ2<2.6TeV-2 and -8.4<cW/Λ2<10.1TeV-2. The additional jet activity of events in a signal-enriched region is also studied, and the measurements are in agreement with predictions."
"Preparation of Cu-BTC/PVA Fibers with Antibacterial Applications  2018, The Korean Fiber Society and Springer Nature B.V.In this study, a metal-organic framework (MOF)/polymer electrospun fiber was prepared. The MOF, copper-1,3,5- benzenetricarboxylate (Cu-BTC), was synthesized using a sonochemical method at 25 °C, with a 1:1:1 mixture of dimethylformamide, ethanol, and deionized water as solvent. The sonication time was shown to have a pronounced effect on the morphology and structure of the Cu-BTC. A square pyramid shape with sides of 100 nm was obtained after 2 h of sonication. Extending the sonication time provided a lower amount of unknown phase and produced a uniform Cu-BTC framework. The Cu-BTC-modified PVA fibers were then fabricated by electrospinning. The effect of the Cu-BTC and PVA concentration was investigated at 25 kV, a flow rate of 10 μl/min, and a working distance of 150 mm. FTIR spectra and FESEM images showed good dispersion of the Cu-BTC on the PVA fiber. The as-prepared Cu-BTC-modified PVA fibers exhibited excellent antibacterial effectiveness against S. aureus."
"Validation of previously reported predictors for radiation-induced hypothyroidism in nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy, a post hoc analysis from a Phase III randomized trial The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Japan Radiation Research Society and Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology.This study aimed to validate previously reported dosimetric parameters, including thyroid volume, mean dose, and percentage thyroid volume, receiving at least 40, 45 and 50 Gy (V40, V45 and V50), absolute thyroid volume spared (VS) from 45, 50 and 60 Gy (VS45, VS50 and VS60), and clinical factors affecting the development of radiation-induced hypothyroidism (RHT). A post hoc analysis was performed in 178 euthyroid nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients from a Phase III study comparing sequential versus simultaneous-integrated boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy. RHT was determined by increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with or without reduced free thyroxin, regardless of symptoms. The median follow-up time was 42.5 months. The 1-, 2- and 3-year freedom from RHT rates were 78.4%, 56.4% and 43.4%, respectively. The median latency period was 21 months. The thyroid gland received a median mean dose of 53.5 Gy. Female gender, smaller thyroid volume, higher pretreatment TSH level (≥1.55 μU/ml) and VS60 < 10 cm 3 were significantly associated with RHT in univariate analyses. Only pretreatment TSH ≥ 1.55 μU/ml and VS60 < 10 cm 3 were significant predictors in multivariate analysis. Our results suggested that patients with pretreatment TSH ≥ 1.55 μU/ml should be cautious about the risk of RHT. The VS60 ≥ 10 cm 3 is recommended for treatment planning."
"Proteomic analysis of canine oral tumor tissues using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and in-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometry (GeLC MS/MS) approaches  2018 Pisamai et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Oral tumors, including highly invasive and metastatic oral melanoma (OM), non-tonsillar oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and benign tumors (BN), are common neoplasms in dogs. Although these tumors behave differently, limited data of their protein expression profiles have been exhibited, particularly at the proteome level. The present study aimed to i.) characterize peptide-mass fingerprints (PMFs) and identify potential protein candidates of OM, OSCC, BN and normal control subjects, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), ii.) identify potential protein candidates associated with the diseases, using in-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometric analysis (GeLC-MS/MS) and iii.) search for relationships between chemotherapy drugs and disease-perturbed proteins. A distinct cluster of each sample group and unique PMFs with identified protein candidates were revealed. The unique peptide fragment at 2,274 Da of sacsin molecular chaperone (SACS) was observed in early-stage OM whereas the fragment at 1,958 Da of sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 10 (SCN10A) was presented in early- and late-stage OM. The peptide mass at 2,316 Da of Notch1 appeared in early-stage OM and benign oral tumors while the peptide mass at 2,505 Da of glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate type subunit 3A (GRIN3A) was identified in all groups. Markedly expressed proteins from GeLC-MS/MS included Jumonji domain containing 1C (JMJD1C) in benign tumors, inversin (INVS) and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 28 (ARHGEF28) in OM, BTB domain-containing 16 (BTBD16) in OSCC, and protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1), BRCA2, DNA repair associated (BRCA2), WW domain binding protein 2 (WBP2), purinergic receptor P2Y1 and proteasome activator subunit 4 (PSME4) in all cancerous groups. The network connections between these proteins and chemotherapy drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin, were also demonstrated. In conclusion, this study unveiled the unique PMFs and novel candidate protein markers of canine oral tumors."
"Risk factors for parenteral nutrition-dependence and mortality with the short bowel syndrome: A 10-year retrospective study in Thailand  2018 HEC Press.Background and Objectives: Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a rare and life-threatening disease. Few studies have investigated risk factors for parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependence and death in SBS. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for PN-dependence and long-term mortality in SBS. Methods and Study Design: This retrospective study reviewed and evaluated children and adults who were diagnosed with SBS at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from October 2005 to January 2015. Age, causes of SBS, length of remnant bowel, type of anastomosis, types of nutrition support, SBS-associated complications, PN-dependence rate, duration of PN-dependence, mortality rate, and causes of death were evaluated. Results: Twenty-two adults and 19 children were reviewed. The median follow-up time was 48 months. At the end of follow-up, PNdependence rate was 51.2%. The residual colon ≥50% group had a significantly lower PN-dependence rate, with a hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14-0.93; p=0.03). The most frequent cause of death was infection, with the highest percentage of mortality occurring within the first 2 years after surgery. The mortality rate was 53.8% and the residual colon ≥50% group had a significantly lower mortality rate, with a hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14- 0.88; p=0.03). Conclusions: PN-dependence and death occurred in about half of all patients. Residual colon ≥50% was significantly associated with lower death rate and PN-dependence. The crucial role of colon in continuity as a protective factor should be investigated further in prospective studies."
"Real-world simulation of an alternative retinopathy of prematurity screening system in Thailand: A pilot study  2018 Healio.Purpose: To evaluate an alternative retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening system that identifies infants meriting examination by an ophthalmologist in a middleincome country. Methods: The authors hypothesized that grading posterior pole images for the presence of pre-plus or plus disease has high sensitivity to identify infants with type 1 ROP that requires treatment. Part 1 of the study evaluated the feasibility of having a non-ophthalmologist health care worker obtain retinal images of prematurely born infants using a non-contact retinal camera (Pictor; Volk Optical, Inc., Mentor, OH) that were of sufficient quality to grade for pre-plus or plus disease. Part 2 investigated the accuracy of grading these images to identify infants with type 1 ROP. The authors prospectively recruited infants at Chulalongkorn University Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand). On days infants underwent routine ROP screening, a trained health care worker imaged their retinas with Pictor. Two ROP experts graded these serial images from a remote location for image gradability and posterior pole disease. Results: Fifty-six infants were included. Overall, 69.4% of infant imaging sessions were gradable. Among gradable images, the sensitivity of both graders for identifying an infant with type 1 ROP by grading for the presence of pre-plus or plus disease was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31 to 1.0) for grader 1 and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.40 to 1.0) for grader 2. The specificity was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.76 to 0.99) for grader 1 and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.88) for grader 2. Conclusions: It was feasible for a trained non-ophthalmologist health care worker to obtain retinal images of infants using the Pictor that were of sufficient quality to identify infants with type 1 ROP."
"Some properties of infinite factorials  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimWith the Axiom of Choice AC, p!= 2p for any infinite cardinal p but, without AC, we cannot conclude any relationship between p! and 2p for an arbitrary infinite cardinal p. In this paper, we give some properties of p! in the absence of AC and compare them to those of 2p for an infinite cardinal p. Among our results, we show that “pn < p! for any infinite cardinal p and any natural number n” is provable in ZF although “p2 ≤ 2p for any infinite cardinal p” is not."
"Detection of differential settlement of man-made structures coupled with urban development by using persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)  2018 by the authors.Many cities are prone to land subsidence, particularly due to the overuse of ground water. However, because man-made structures are normally built upon foundations that are stiffer than the surrounding ground, such structures react to land subsidence to a lesser extent. This settlement mismatch between ground and buildings, also known as differential settlement (DS), may cause serious problems in urban management, such as foundation overloading due to down-drag forces and damage to underground pipelines. Here, we present a technique for determining DS from multi-temporal satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Permanent scatterers originating from ground and man-made structures are extracted using the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) technique, whereupon the DS is obtained by subtracting the settlement of the former from that of the latter. For validation purposes, we demonstrate that the estimated DS in Bangkok is consistent with field observations."

"Quasinormal modes of black strings in de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley massive gravity  2018, The Author(s).The effect of massive scalar perturbations on neutral black string in de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity is investigated through the study of the quasi-normal modes (QNMs). Due to the similarity between the equation of motion of the field in the black-string and black-hole background, similar numerical and analytical techniques can be used to explore the behaviour of the QNMs. We use the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) and the WKB method to numerically calculate the QNMs of scalar perturbation in the black string background with positive cosmological constant. High-momentum behaviour of such QNMs can be analytically approximated by the first-order WKB method with excellent accuracy. For near-extremal black string with event horizon very close to the cosmological horizon, the Pöschl–Teller technique gives accurate analytic formula for the QNMs. When massive-gravity-parameter γ increases, we found that the scalar modes oscillate with higher frequencies and decay faster. The QNMs of black string in spacetime with negative cosmological constant are explored in all range of possible γ using the spectral method. We found the movement of the holographic sound poles to collide and form diffusive poles as γ changes from positive to negative values. We observe no evidence of instability of neutral black string in both positive and negative cosmological constant cases."
"Towards a tensionless string field theory for the N= (2 0) CFT in d = 6  2018, The Author(s).We describe progress in using the field theory of tensionless strings to arrive at a Lagrangian for the six-dimensional N= (2 0) conformal theory. We construct the free part of the theory and propose an ansatz for the cubic vertex in light-cone superspace. By requiring closure of the (2, 0) supersymmetry algebra, we fix the cubic vertex up to two parameters."
"Search for a singly produced third-generation scalar leptoquark decaying to a τ lepton and a bottom quark in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search is presented for a singly produced third-generation scalar leptoquark decaying to a τ lepton and a bottom quark. Associated production of a leptoquark and a τ lepton is considered, leading to a final state with a bottom quark and two τ leptons. The search uses proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of the third-generation scalar leptoquarks as a function of their mass. From a comparison of the results with the theoretical predictions, a third-generation scalar leptoquark decaying to a τ lepton and a bottom quark, assuming unit Yukawa coupling (λ), is excluded for masses below 740 GeV. Limits are also set on λ of the hypothesized leptoquark as a function of its mass. Above λ = 1.4, this result provides the best upper limit on the mass of a third-generation scalar leptoquark decaying to a τ lepton and a bottom quark.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Neurological prognostications for the therapeutic hypothermia among comatose survivors of cardiac arrest  2018 Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.Background: Currently, there are limited data of prognostic clues for neurological recovery in comatose survivors undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH). We aimed to evaluate clinical signs and findings that could predict neurological outcomes, and determine the optimal time for the prognostication. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed database of postarrest survivors treated with TH in our hospital from 2006 to 2014. Cerebral performance category (CPC), neurological signs and findings in electroencephalography (EEG) and brain computed tomography (CT) were evaluated. In addition, the optimal time to evaluate neurological status was analyzed. Results: TH was performed in 51 postarrest patients. Approximately 53% of TH patients survived at discharge and 33% of the hospital survivors had favorable outcome (CPC1-2). The prognostic clues for unfavorable outcome (CPC3-5) at discharge were lack of pupillary light response (PLR) and/or gag reflex after rewarming, and the absence of at least one of the brainstem reflexes, no eye-opening, or abnormal motor response on the 7th day. Myoclonus and seizure could not be used to indicate poor prognosis. In addition, prognostic values of EEG and CT findings were inconclusive. Conclusions: Our study showed the simple neurological signs helped predict short-term neurological prognosis. The most reliable sign determining unfavorable outcome was the lack of PLR. The optimal time to assess prognosis was either at 48-72 h or 7 days after return of spontaneous circulation."
"Momentum space approach to crossing symmetric CFT correlators  2018, The Author(s).We construct a crossing symmetric basis for conformal four-point functions in momentum space by requiring consistent factorization. Just as scattering amplitudes factorize when the intermediate particle is on-shell, non-analytic parts of conformal correlators enjoy a similar factorization in momentum space. Based on this property, Polyakov, in his pioneering 1974 work, introduced a basis for conformal correlators which manifestly satisfies the crossing symmetry. He then initiated the bootstrap program by requiring its consistency with the operator product expansion. This approach is complementary to the ordinary bootstrap program, which is based on the conformal block and requires the crossing symmetry as a consistency condition of the theory. Even though Polyakov’s original bootstrap approach has been revisited recently, the crossing symmetric basis has not been constructed explicitly in momentum space. In this paper we complete the construction of the crossing symmetric basis for scalar four-point functions with an intermediate operator with a general spin, by using new analytic expressions for three-point functions involving one tensor. Our new basis manifests the analytic properties of conformal correlators. Also the connected and disconnected correlators are manifestly separated, so that it will be useful for the study of large N CFTs in particular."
"Optimization of succinic acid production by actinobacillus sp. NP9-aA7 using plackett-burman design coupled with box-behnken design  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.The potential succinic acid bacterium, isolate NP9-aA7, was isolated from bovine rumen fluid. The phenotypic characterization and phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the isolate NP9-aA7 was identified to Actinobacillus succinogenes. The statistical methods combining Plackett-Burman Design (PBD) and Box-Behnken Design (BBD) were developed to optimize the process. The key factors consist of glucose 74 g/L, yeast extract 30 g/L, and MgCO3 60 g/L which gave a maximum succinic acid to 60.09 g/L with a yield of 0.8161 g/g glucose after 36 h. Batch fermentations in a 2-L fermenter leading to the highest succinic acid production which validated the model with the succinic acid of 58.08 g/L after 27 h. Moreover, the CO2 of 50.66 kPa and alkaline neutralizers (45 g/L of MgCO3 and 15 g/L of Mg(OH)2) enhanced succinic acid to 72.93 g/L with a yield of 1.393 g/g glucose after 24 h. When using SSH 40 g/L as a carbon source, the succinic acid of 27.70 g/L was obtained after 48 h. A. succinogenes NP9-aA7 has a potential for succinic acid production and combined statistical methods were powerful for optimizing the process."
"Emergence of multiple norovirus strains in Thailand, 2015–2017  2018 Elsevier B.V.Norovirus is a major cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Infection can be sporadic or result in widespread outbreaks. The surveillance of norovirus samples (n = 1591) obtained from patients with diarrhea in Thailand from January 2015 to February 2017 suggested that the predominance of norovirus GII.4 often seen in sporadic infection had been superseded by the emergence of GII.17. More recently, a sharp increase in acute gastroenteritis associated with norovirus GII·P16-GII.2 recombinant strain was observed at the end of 2016. Thus, previously rare norovirus strains and their recombinant derivatives may be more frequently responsible for future outbreaks."
"Chitosan Nanocapsules for pH-Triggered Dual Release Based on Corrosion Inhibitors as Model Study  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimChitosan (CS) is known for its uniqueness in terms of containing reactive functional groups, i.e., amino and hydroxyl groups, along the chain which offer the noncovalent bonds and chemical modifications. At pH 3 in emulsion system, the CS chains are under charge-charge repulsive force, leading the polysaccharide chains to align as the hollow nanospheres and at that time, the crosslink leads to the nanocapsules. The CS nanocapsules allow the model cargos, i.e., corrosion inhibitors, entrapment not only via the noncovalent bond based on the weak interaction in the core for 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) cargo but also via the chemical bonds based on the amino group remaining on CS structure to result in either amide or Schiff base linkage in case of 3-nitrosalicylic acid (3NiSA) cargo. The release studies indicate that CS nanocapsules can release two cargoes upon pH change due to the acidic/basic-triggered cleavage of bonds between cargoes and nanocapsules. Once corrosion occurs, resulting in variation of the local pH value, the CS nanocapsules release MBT in fast and 3NiSA in a slow, sustained manner. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated using the nanocapsules for hindering the corrosion of copper as measured by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance."
"Novel potential biomarkers for opisthorchis viverrini infection and associated cholangiocarcinoma  2018 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido. All Rights Reserved.Background/Aim: Early detection of disease is a pivotal factor for determining prognosis and clinical outcome of patients with cancer. As cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is currently difficult to detect and most cases of such cancer present with late-stage disease at the time of initial diagnosis, we employed proteomic analysis of the bile to identify potential candidate biomarkers for Opisthorchis viverrini (OV)-associated CCA. Materials and Methods: Proteins in pooled bile samples from patients with CCA and OV infection, with CCA without OV infection, with OV infection but no CCA, and with neither OV infection nor CCA were separated by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in-gel trypsin digestion and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: According to our analysis, three proteins, namely aristaless-like homeobox1 isoform X1 (ALX1), major histocompatibility complex polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), and uncharacterized protein C14orf105 isoform X12 were found to be potential markers for OV infection, as they were predominantly found in all OV-infected groups. Although these proteins were detected in both OV-infected patients with and without CCA, their abundance was 2.90-, 7.06-and 3.65-fold higher, respectively, in those with CCA. In patients with CCA, potential novel biomarkers wre immunoglobulin heavy chain, translocated in liposarcoma (TLS), visual system homeobox 2 (VSX2) and an unnamed protein product. Conclusion: We provided novel information regarding potential biomarkers for OV infection and CCA. These two protein profiles could benefit diagnosis as well as monitoring of CCA."
"Update on the pathophysiology and management of anorectal disorders  2018 Editorial Office of Gut and Liver. All Rights Reserved.Anorectal disorders are common and present with overlapping symptoms. They include several disorders with both structural and functional dysfunction(s). Because symptoms alone are poor predictors of the underlying pathophysiology, a diagnosis should only be made after evaluating symptoms and physiologic and structural abnormalities. A detailed history, a thorough physical and digital rectal examination and a systematic evaluation with high resolution and/or high definition three-dimensional (3D) anorectal manometry, 3D anal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance defecography and neurophysiology tests are essential to correctly identify these conditions. These physiological and imaging tests play a key role in facilitating a precise diagnosis and in providing a better understanding of the pathophysiology and functional anatomy. In turn, this leads to better and more comprehensive management using medical, behavioral and surgical approaches. For example, patients presenting with difficult defecation May demonstrate dyssynergic defecation and will benefit from biofeedback therapy before considering surgical treatment of coexisting anomalies such as rectoceles or intussusception. Similarly, patients with significant rectal prolapse and pelvic floor dysfunction or patients with complex enteroceles and pelvic organ prolapse May benefit from combined behavioral and surgical approaches, including an open, laparoscopic, transabdominal or transanal, and/or robotic-assisted surgery. Here, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of selected common anorectal disorders."
"Search for a heavy resonance decaying into a Z boson and a vector boson in the νν¯ q q ¯ final state  2018, The Author(s).A search is presented for a heavy resonance decaying into either a pair of Z bosons or a Z boson and a W boson (ZZ or WZ), with a Z boson decaying into a pair of neutrinos and the other boson decaying hadronically into two collimated quarks that are reconstructed as a highly energetic large-cone jet. The search is performed using the data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC during 2016 in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. No excess is observed in data with regard to background expectations. Results are interpreted in scenarios of physics beyond the standard model. Limits at 95% confidence level on production cross sections are set at 0.9 fb (63 fb) for spin-1 W′ bosons, included in the heavy vector triplet model, with mass 4.0 TeV (1.0 TeV), and at 0.5 fb (40 fb) for spin-2 bulk gravitons with mass 4.0 TeV (1.0 TeV). Lower limits are set on the masses of W′ bosons in the context of two versions of the heavy vector triplet model of 3.1TeV and 3.4 TeV, respectively.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"ALMA 26 Arcmin2 Survey of GOODS-S at One Millimeter (ASAGAO): Average Morphology of High-z Dusty Star-forming Galaxies in an Exponential Disk (n ≃ 1)  2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present morphological properties of dusty star-forming galaxies at z = 1-3 determined with the high-resolution (FWHM ∼ 0.″19) Atacama Large Milllimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1 mm map of our ASAGAO survey covering a 26 arcmin2 area in GOODS-S. In conjunction with the ALMA archival data, our sample consists of 45 ALMA sources with infrared luminosity (L IR) range of ∼1011-1013 L o. To obtain an average rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) profile, we perform individual measurements and careful stacking of the ALMA sources using the uv-visibility method that includes positional-uncertainty and smoothing-effect evaluations through Monte Carlo simulations. We find that our sample has an average FIR-wavelength Sérsic index and effective radius of n FIR = 1.2 ± 0.2 and R e,FIR = 1.0-1.3 kpc, respectively, additionally with a point-source component at the center, indicative of the existence of active galactic nuclei. The average FIR profile agrees with a morphology of an exponential disk clearly distinguished from a de Vaucouleurs spheroidal profile (Sérsic index of 4). We also examine the rest-frame optical Sérsic index n opt and effective radius R e,opt with deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Interestingly, we obtain n opt = 0.9 ± 0.3 (≃n FIR) and R e,opt = 3.2 ± 0.6 kpc (>R e,FIR), suggesting that the dusty disk-like structure is embedded within a larger stellar disk. The rest-frame UV and FIR data of HST and ALMA provide us with a radial profile of the total star formation rate (SFR), where the infrared SFR dominates over the UV SFR at the center. Under the assumption of a constant SFR, a compact stellar distribution in z ∼ 1-2 compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs) is well reproduced, while a spheroidal stellar morphology of cQGs (n opt = 4) is not, suggestive of other important mechanism(s) such as dynamical dissipation."
"Novel Gonioscopy Score and Predictive Factors for Intraocular Pressure Lowering after Phacoemulsification Copyright  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Purpose: To evaluate a novel gonioscopy score as a potential predictor for intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction after cataract surgery. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study that included consecutive patients with or without glaucoma, either with open or narrow angles but without peripheral anterior synechiae, who underwent phacoemulsification. Eyes with intraoperative complications and secondary glaucoma were excluded. A preoperative gonioscopy score was created, summing the Shaffer gonioscopy grading in 4 quadrants (range, 0 to 16). To determine variables associated with IOP change at 6 months, univariate and multivariate linear mixed-effects regression analysis was performed adjusting for age, sex, and preoperative IOP. Results: In total, 188 eyes from 137 patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 75.0 (±8.5) years and the average preoperative IOP was 15.6 (±3.6)mmHg with 0.7 (range, 0 to 4) glaucoma medications. The mean IOP reduction after phacoemulsification was 3.0 (±2.6)mmHg at postoperative month 6. After multivariate analysis, preoperative IOP [β=0.49 (0.41-0.58), P<0.0001], gonioscopy score [β=?0.17 (?0.24 to ?0.09), P<0.0001], anterior chamber depth (ACD) [β=?0.88 (?1.64 to ?0.14), P=0.02], and IOP/ACD ratio [β=0.45 (0.07 to 0.83) P=0.021] were associated with IOP reduction at 6 months. Conclusions: Preoperative predictors for IOP reduction after cataract surgery were preoperative IOP, ACD, gonioscopy score, and IOP/ACD ratio. The IOP/ACD ratio and gonioscopy score can be easy parameters to obtain and may help clinicians to estimate the IOP reduction after phacoemulsification."

"Azimuthal correlations for inclusive 2-jet, 3-jet, and 4-jet events in pp collisions at √s=13TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.Azimuthal correlations between the two jets with the largest transverse momenta pT in inclusive 2-, 3-, and 4-jet events are presented for several regions of the leading jet pT up to 4Te. For 3- and 4-jet scenarios, measurements of the minimum azimuthal angles between any two of the three or four leading pT jets are also presented. The analysis is based on data from proton–proton collisions collected by the CMS Collaboration at a centre-of-mass energy of 13Te, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1. Calculations based on leading-order matrix elements supplemented with parton showering and hadronization do not fully describe the data, so next-to-leading-order calculations matched with parton shower and hadronization models are needed to better describe the measured distributions. Furthermore, we show that azimuthal jet correlations are sensitive to details of the parton showering, hadronization, and multiparton interactions. A next-to-leading-order calculation matched with parton showers in the MC@NLO method, as implemented in herwig 7, gives a better overall description of the measurements than the powheg method."
"Lung cancer stem cells and cancer stem cell-targeting natural compounds  2018 International Institute of Anticancer Research. All rights reserved.The novel information regarding molecular and translational research have created a paradigm shift in the understanding of lung cancer biology, revealing the more precise target for anti-cancer drug discovery. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide accounting for approximately 1 in 5 of all cancer-related deaths. The most important causes of death in such a cancer involves the treatment failure as well as the spreading of cancer cells to distant sites which the cancer stem cell (CSC) within the tumor is accepted as a key driver. CSC is a rare special population of cancer cells exhibiting high tumorigenic properties together with self-renewal and differentiation capability. CSC is not only linked with high tumor-initiating activity, but is also implicated in chemotherapeutic resistance, metastasis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and recurrence. Thereafter, novel therapeutic strategies targeting these CSCs are considered in order to improve long-term clinical outcome. Here, we provide sufficient data regarding the biology of CSC in lung cancer, known CSC markers and cellular signals, and promising compounds targeting the stem cell signals in lung cancer that may benefit the development of novel anti-cancer treatment."
"Photocaged PNIPAM: A Light Tunable Thermal Responsive Polymer  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimPhotocaged poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM)s, copolymers consisting of N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) and N-isopropyl-N-(2-nitrobenzyl) acrylamide, are prepared by free radical polymerization. Upon UV irradiation, the hydrophobic o-nitrobenzyl group is cleaved, which subsequently releases the caged NH group and generates more hydrogen bonds with water. As a result, the lower critical solution temperature of caged PNIPAM can be obtained as a function of the photolysis degree of o-nitrobenenzyl caged amides."
"Measurement of the underlying event activity in inclusive Z boson production in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).This paper presents a measurement of the underlying event activity in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, performed using inclusive Z boson production events collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb−1. The underlying event activity is quantified in terms of the charged particle multiplicity, as well as of the scalar sum of the charged particles’ transverse momenta in different topological regions defined with respect to the Z boson direction. The distributions are unfolded to the stable particle level and compared with predictions from various Monte Carlo event generators, as well as with similar CDF and CMS measurements at center-of-mass energies of 1.96 and 7 TeV respectively.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Trends in the use of illicit substances in Thailand: Results from national household surveys  2018 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other DrugsIntroduction and Aims: Thailand borders some of the world’s largest methamphetamine and opioid producing countries and trafficking routes. Thailand’s ‘War on Drugs’ campaign was launched in 2003. This study reports trends in illicit substance use in Thailand over the period 2001–2011. Design and Methods: National Household surveys on illicit drug use were conducted in 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2011. A stratified multi-stage cluster random sampling technique was implemented for each survey. Provinces in four regions were systematically selected using a probability proportionate to the size of the targeted population. Participants were interviewed using structured questionnaires on their history of substance use. Results: The prevalence of illicit drug use within the past drastically decreased from 4.5% in 2001 to 1.0% in 2003 (P < 0.05). Since 2003, the prevalence of illicit use within the past year varied between 1.0% and 1.3%. By 2011, it was estimated that 0.84% have used kratom (a substance derived from Mitragyna speciosa) within the past year. Around 0.20% and 0.19% reported using cannibis and yaba (metamphetamine tablet) within a year of the 2011 survey. Other types of illicit drugs were less commonly used in Thailand. Discussion and Conclusions: There was a decrease in prevalence of illicit drug use within the past year between 2001 and 2003 in Thailand. Since 2003, the past year prelavence of illicit drug use has remained relatively stable. From 2001 to 2011, cannabis, kratom and yaba have remained the three most commonly reported types of illicit drugs used in Thailand."
"Effectiveness of essence of chicken on cognitive function improvement: A randomized controlled clinical trial  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.High-quality, adequately-powered clinical trials investigating the effect of Essence of Chicken (EC) on cognitive function are lacking. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on healthy adult volunteers to determine the effect of EC on short-term memory, working memory, and selective and sustained attention. As a secondary objective, we evaluated baseline stress as a modifying factor by including treatment, stress and visit as main effects in a three-way ANOVA model. Cognitive function was evaluated at baseline, and Days 7 and 14. Data from 235 participants were analyzed on a per-protocol basis. The three-way interaction effect was significant (p = 0.020) in Digit Span Forward and further analyses showed EC improved test performance in moderate (p = 0.041) and severe stress (p = 0.065) but not in normal and mild stress subgroups. In Digit Span Backward, EC group showed greater improvement compared to placebo (p = 0.028), with 0.60 digits (8.50% improvement from baseline) more recalled on Day 7. No treatment or interaction effects were statistically significant in selective and sustained attention tests. Our findings support EC’s effect in improving mental processes used in working memory among healthy adults and short-term memory among healthy adults experiencing stress in daily life."
"Efficacy of BGJ398, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 1–3 inhibitor, in patients with previously treated advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 alterations  2018 American Association for Cancer Research.BGJ398, a potent and selective pan-FGFR antagonist, was prospectively evaluated in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma bearing a diverse array of FGFR3 alterations. Patients (N = 67) who were unable to receive platinum chemotherapy were enrolled. The majority (70.1%) had received two or more prior antineoplastic therapies. BGJ398 was administered orally at 125 mg/day on a 3 weeks on, 1 week off schedule until unacceptable toxicity or progression. The primary endpoint was the response rate. Among 67 patients treated, an overall response rate of 25.4% was observed and an additional 38.8% of patients had disease stabilization, translating to a disease control rate of 64.2%. The most common treatment-emergent toxicities were hyperphosphatemia, elevated creatinine, fatigue, constipation, and decreased appetite. Further examination of BGJ398 in this disease setting is warranted. SIGnIFICAnCE: BJG398 is active in patients with alterations in FGFR3, resulting in both reductions in tumor volume and stabilization of disease. Our data highlight putative mechanisms of resistance to the agent, which may be useful in following disease status."
"Biomethanation efficiency of para-grass in piggery wastewater in single stage and temperature phased anaerobic systems  2018 Elsevier LtdEffects of para-grass (PG) addition to pig manure (PM) digester were evaluated at organic loadings 0.10–3.76 gVS/L.d by different PG mixing ratios 0–8% in mesophilic single-stage (MS) and temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD, comprising T1 and M2 reactors) systems. Results showed equivalent methane production between MS and TPAD until 4%PG mix. Highest biogas yields obtained were 271.7 and 264.0 m3/tondry for MS and TPAD, respectively. Even with intense VFAs accumulation, the acidification yield in T1 was less than M2 because of continuous conversion of VFAs to CH4. Only at higher loading (8%PG), reactor staging by temperature was justified for this co-digestion as TPAD exhibited a superior performance and lesser mass transfer impediment. Para-grass addition to PM digester shifted the domination of bacterial strains whereas achaea were steady. Higher microbial diversity and some evolving hydrolytic bacteria observed in T1 could contribute to greater system stability at high solid loading. An addition of small front-end thermophilic tank should be considered when expansion of the existing MS system is planned to process higher solid."
"Efficient ZFN-Mediated Stop Codon Integration into the CCR5 Locus in Hematopoietic Stem Cells: A Possible Source for Intrabone Marrow Cell Transplantation  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. We reported a simple genome editing approach that can generate human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) coreceptor defective cells, which may be useful for latent viral eradication treatment. Samples of bone marrow leftover after diagnostic procedures and crude bone marrow from aviremic HIV patients were subjected to zinc finger nuclease-mediated stop codon insertion into chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) loci. Locked nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction was used to estimate the amount of insertion in the expandable CD34 + cells. The results showed that about 0.5% of CD34 + cells carried stop codon insertions in CCR5 loci. Cells edited using this simple protocol have the potential to be infused back into the bone marrow."
"Copper conductive patterns through spray-pyrolysis of copper-diethanolamine complex solution  2018 Chotipanich et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.A simple and low-cost method to fabricate copper conductive patterns at low temperature is critical for printed electronics. Low-temperature spray-pyrolysis of copper-alkanolamine complex solution shows high potential for this application. However, the produced copper patterns exhibit a granular structure consisting of connected fine copper particles. In this work, low-temperature spray-pyrolysis of copper formate-diethanolamine complex solution under N2 flow at a temperature of 200 C was investigated. The effects of spraying conditions on microstructure and electrical properties of the patterns were examined. Our results revealed that the spraying rate is a critical parameter determining the degree of sintering and electrical resistivity of the patterns. A low spraying rate facilitates sintering, and hence well-sintered copper patterns with the lowest resistivity of 6.12 μΩ.cm (3.6 times of bulk copper) on a polyimide substrate could be fabricated."
"Short Communication: Discordance in Drug Resistance Mutations between Blood Plasma and Semen or Rectal Secretions among Newly Diagnosed HIV-1-Infected Thai Men Who Have Sex with Men  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection is most commonly transmitted by sexual contact across mucosal surfaces. Information on concordance in drug resistance profile between blood plasma and anogenital compartments in resource-limited settings is limited. We aimed to determine discordances in genotypic drug resistance-associated mutations (DRAMs) between blood plasma and semen or rectal secretions among newly diagnosed, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, HIV-1-infected Thai men who have sex with men (MSM). Blood plasma, semen, and rectal secretions of HIV-1-infected Thai MSM enrolled from the Test and Treat cohort were tested for genotypic mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. Seven participants with baseline DRAMs in blood plasma were included in this analysis. In anogenital samples, HIV-1 RNA could be fully amplified for DRAMs assessment in semen from three participants and in rectal secretions from four participants. DRAMs were identified in semen from two of three participants and in rectal secretions from four of four participants. Three participants had DRAMs in anogenital compartments that were not detected in blood plasma - one had DRAMs in semen that was not detected in blood plasma (I54FI) and two had DRAMs in rectal secretions that was not detected in blood plasma (I47IM; K70N, L74I, Y115F, M184V, K103N, V108I, and H221Y). Discordance in DRAMs between blood plasma and anogenital compartments is not uncommon among newly diagnosed, ART-naive, HIV-1-infected Thai MSM. Monitoring of drug-resistant virus in these vector compartments is warranted particularly as pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment as prevention are increasingly used as the mainstay strategies to end the AIDS epidemic."
"OC-STAMP promotes osteoclast fusion for pathogenic bone resorption in periodontitis via up-regulation of permissive fusogen CD9  FASEB.Cell fusion–mediated formation of multinuclear osteoclasts (OCs) plays a key role in bone resorption. It is reported that 2 unique OC-specific fusogens [i.e., OC-stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) and dendritic cell–specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP)], and permissive fusogen CD9, are involved in OC fusion. In contrast to DC-STAMP-knockout (KO) mice, which show the osteopetrotic phenotype, OC-STAMP-KO mice show no difference in systemic bone mineral density. Nonetheless, according to the ligature-induced periodontitis model, significantly lower level of bone resorption was found in OC-STAMP-KO mice compared to WT mice. Anti–OC-STAMP-neutralizing mAb down-modulated in vitro: 1) the emergence of large multinuclear tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive cells, 2) pit formation, and 3) mRNA and protein expression of CD9, but not DC-STAMP, in receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL)-stimulated OC precursor cells (OCps). While anti–DC-STAMP-mAb also down-regulated RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro, it had no effect on CD9 expression. In our mouse model, systemic administration of anti–OC-STAMP-mAb suppressed the expression of CD9 mRNA, but not DC-STAMP mRNA, in periodontal tissue, along with diminished alveolar bone loss and reduced emergence of CD9+ OCps and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive multinuclear OCs. The present study demonstrated that OC-STAMP partners CD9 to promote periodontal bone destruction by up-regulation of fusion during osteoclastogenesis, suggesting that anti–OC-STAMP-mAb may lead to the development of a novel therapeutic regimen for periodontitis.—Ishii, T., Ruiz-Torruella, M., Ikeda, A., Shindo, S., Movila, A., Mawardi, H., Albassam, A., Kayal, R.

"Economic burden of the inadequate management of allergic rhinitis and urticaria in Asian countries based on the GA2LEN model  The Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology.Purpose: Across Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, (referred to as Asia) approximately 30-53 million individuals of the 151 million employed suffer from allergic rhinitis (AR) and urticaria. It is estimated that approximately 90% of patients with these allergic conditions are insufficiently treated, impacting the socioeconomic burden in terms of absence from work and decreased productivity. This study aims to estimate the socioeconomic burden of allergies in Asia and the cost savings that their adequate management can provide. Due to the limited availability of regional data, this study focused AR and urticaria in selected countries. Methods: Published literature, information from statistical bureaus, clinician surveys and extrapolation of selected data from the European Union were used to determine the socioeconomic costs of AR and urticaria. Results: Many patients in Asia suffer from perennial allergies and experience symptoms of AR and urticaria for up to 298 days per year. An estimate of the indirect costs of patients insufficiently treated for AR and urticaria amounts to USD 105.4 billion a year, which equates to USD 1,137-2,195 per patient due to absenteeism and presenteeism. Adherence to guideline-approved treatment can lead to estimated savings of up to USD 104 billion. Conclusions: The current study suggests that within Asia, the socioeconomic impact of AR and urticaria is similar to that seen in the European Union in spite of the lower wages in Asia. This is due to the mainly perennial allergens prevailing in Asia, whereas the sensitization patterns observed in the European Union are dominated by seasonal exposure to pollen. These results underline the need for governmental initiatives to increase public awareness on the prevention and treatment of these and other allergic diseases as well as greater research funding and large-scale studies to reduce their growing socioeconomic burden in coming years."
"Sulfur, strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotopes of calcium sulfate deposits in late carboniferous rocks of the loei-wang saphung (LWS) area, Loei province, Thailand  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Sulfate deposits of the Loei-Wang Saphung (LWS) area, northeastern Thailand, intercalated with carbonate and silicic clastic rock were analyzed for S, O, C, and Sr to determine the depositional environment, as well as the age of formation. Sulfate samples yielded average values of δ34S of 14.6‰, while the87Sr/86Sr ratio of gypsum was 0.708282 and that of anhydrite was 0.708288. The carbonate layers yielded average δ18OPDB, and δ13C values of −12.5‰ and −0.1‰, respectively. Our results revealed that the LWS evaporite deposits were originally formed from seawater, and the relatively negative value of δ18O was a result of meteoric alteration during subaerial exposure of the sections. Comparing these isotopic values with the nearby Nakon Sawan sulfate deposits, the Sr isotopes showed slightly higher values with very mild variations. These isotopic values suggest that the LWS deposits were not affected by subsequent hydrothermal alteration by younger igneous dikes in this area. Therefore, some of these isotope signatures are considered to be primary features of the deposit, despite the fact that the deposit underwent anchizone to epizone metamorphism. The S and Sr isotope values support the depositional age of the LWS sulfate deposit in the Middle to Late Carboniferous."
"Leaching mechanisms of heavy metals from fly ash stabilised soils  2018, The Author(s) 2018.Fly ash is an industrial waste material that is repurposed as a soil stabiliser worldwide. In Thailand, many ground improvement projects utilise mixtures of cement and fly ash to stabilise weak soils. In this study, leaching mechanisms of arsenic, chromium, lead, and zinc from cement and fly ash stabilised soils were investigated in the laboratory. Leaching tests were performed, with different leachants and pH conditions, on cement and fly ash stabilised soils used for soil improvement in road embankment construction projects in Northern Thailand. The results suggested that chemical compounds (CaO and MgO) on fly ash surfaces can control the pH of the fly ash and soil leachant. The dissolution of chromium and zinc was found to be amphoteric and controlled by oxide minerals at a high or low pH. Arsenic leaching was found to be oxyanionic where AsO4 3- prevented the adsorption of arsenic onto the negatively charged fly ash surface. Different types of leachant also leached out in different amounts of heavy metals."
"Rotating-disk electrospinning: needleless electrospinning of poly(caprolactone), poly(lactic acid) and poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofiber mats with controlled morphology  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.As a contribution to the feasibility of high-throughput electrospinning, here we report on the investigation into the production of polymer nanofiber mats through needleless electrospinning. For this study, we used poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), widely used polymers in the field of electrospinning. Optimization studies were carried out to devise the characteristics of the rotating-disk electrospinning system in order to assess the processing window for each polymer. Other factors were also considered, where the production rate, fiber size distribution, and morphology of the specimens acquired by rotating-disk electrospinning and conventional electrospinning techniques were compared. Our studies also illustrate the similarities of this novel “bottom-up” process compared to the conventional one, where a high resolution image confirmed the formation of a cone-jet structure and a Taylor Cone."
"Anodic stripping voltammetric determination of total arsenic using a gold nanoparticle-modified boron-doped diamond electrode on a paper-based device  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.A multistep paper-based analytical device (mPAD) was designed and applied to the voltammetric determination of total inorganic arsenic. The electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles on a boron-doped diamond (AuNP/BDD) electrode and the determination of total inorganic arsenic is accomplished with a single device. Total inorganic arsenic can be determined by first reducing As(V) to As(III) using thiosulfate in 1.0 mol L−1 HCl. As(III) is then deposited on the electrode surface, and total inorganic arsenic is quantified as As(III) by square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry the potential range between −0.25 V and 0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), best at around 0.05 V. Under optimal conditions, the voltammetric response for As(III) detection is linear in the range from 0.1 to 1.5 μg mL−1 and the limit of detection (3SD/slope) is 20 ng mL−1. The relative standard deviation at 0.3, 0.7 and 1.0 μg mL−1 of As(III) are 3.6, 4.3 and 3.3, respectively (10 different electrodes). The results show that the assay has high precision, a rather low working potential, and excellent sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. The method was employed to the determination of total inorganic arsenic in rice samples. Results agreed well with those obtained by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

"Safety of performing transbronchial lung cryobiopsy on hospitalized patients with interstitial lung disease  2018Introduction: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) has become a popular option for tissue diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD), however reports vary regarding the safety of this procedure. Herein, we evaluate the safety of transbronchial cryobiopsy in hospitalized patients, comparing adverse events to outpatient procedures. Methods and measurements: This is a single center, retrospective chart review of all TBLC performed for suspected ILD between November 2013 and March 2017. Biopsies were performed by a board certified interventional pulmonologist or interventional pulmonology fellow using a two-scope technique. Results: One hundred fifty-nine cryobiopsies were performed for the diagnosis of ILD. Rates of adverse events are as follows: pneumothorax 11%, persistent air leak 1.3%, moderate-severe bleeding 3.8%, ICU transfer within 48 h 3.1%, and all cause 30-day mortality 1.9%. No deaths were attributed to the procedure. Comparing adverse events between hospitalized patients and outpatients, rates of pneumothorax were 24% vs 9.9%, persistent air leak 5.9% vs 0.7%, ICU transfer 12% vs 2.1%, and 30-day mortality 5.9% vs 1.4%. However, no differences were statistically significant. Conclusion: Practitioners should recognize that while cryobiopsies are a high-yield, safe, and cost-effective alternative to surgical lung biopsy, not all procedures carry the same risk profiles. Hospitalized patients may have a greater propensity for pneumothorax, persistent air leak, transfer to the ICU, and 30-day mortality."
"Rapid HIV RNA rebound after antiretroviral treatment interruption in persons durably suppressed in Fiebig i acute HIV infection brief-communication  2018 The Author(s).Antiretroviral therapy during the earliest stage of acute HIV infection (Fiebig I) might minimize establishment of a latent HIV reservoir and thereby facilitate viremic control after analytical treatment interruption. We show that 8 participants, who initiated treatment during Fiebig I and were treated for a median of 2.8 years, all experienced rapid viral load rebound following analytical treatment interruption, indicating that additional strategies are required to control or eradicate HIV."
"Hydrolysis of eucalyptus wood chips under hot compressed water in the presence of sulfonated carbon-based catalysts  2018 Institution of Chemical EngineersHydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to sugars and derivatives is a key step in production of biofuels and commodity chemicals in a biorefinery. In this study, catalytic hydrolysis of eucalyptus chips with solid sulfonated carbon-based catalysts prepared from three different carbon precursors (sucrose, glucose, and xylose) was studied under hot-compressed water at 150–250 °C with reaction time of 1–10 min. Increasing temperature up to 200 °C led to higher sugar yields from cellulose and hemicellulose while further increase in temperature caused higher formation of sugar degradation by-products. Sulfonated-sucrose (SO3H-Suc) showed the greatest performance on sugar production compared to other catalysts with less formation of furans and anhydroglucose; its high catalytic activity was related to its high acid site density as proven by NH3-TPD measurement. Size reduction and chemical pretreatment of the biomass were found to enhance the hydrolysis yield and reaction selectivity. The highest sugar yield of 40.7% comprising glucose, fructose, and xylose was achieved using 5% (w/w) SO3H-Suc at 200 °C for 5 min with milled biomass (60–100 μm) pretreated by alkaline oxidation. The work provides an alternative catalytic process for hydrolysis of lignocellulose in biomass industry."
"Petrochemistry, Mineral Chemistry, and Pressure–Temperature Model of Corundum-Bearing Amphibolite from Montepuez, Mozambique  2018, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.Montepuez corundum deposits in the northeastern Mozambique are geologically linked to parts of Neoproterozoic Mozambique Belt collectively described as the Montepuez Complex, containing high-grade metamorphic rocks, belonging to amphibolite facies and including corundum-bearing and corundum-barren amphibolites. Corundum-bearing amphibolites contain pargasite, spinel, and anorthite with minor amounts of corundum and secondary altered rock types containing significant mica and clay minerals. The corundum-barren amphibolites are dominated by pargasite, anorthite, and spinel. Geochemical analyses indicate that the amphibolites probably originated from basaltic protoliths associated with subduction-related arc magmatism. Phase equilibrium modeling in the system Na 2O - MgO - MnO - Al 2O 3- SiO 2- CaO - FeO - H 2O in combination with mineral isopleths indicate pressure–temperature (P–T) conditions of about 10–11.5 kbar and 450–600∘C, lower than those recorded for the Eastern Granulite of the Mozambique Belt that extends northward to Kenya and Tanzania as part of the Pan-African orogen. Therefore, metamorphic P–T condition increased northward, suggesting different levels of crustal thickening of NE Mozambique compared with Tanzania and Kenya."
"Volatile organic compound (VOC) removal via photocatalytic oxidation using TiO2 coated nanofilms  2018, Walailak University. All rights reserved.In this paper, toluene removal via photocatalytic oxidation using TiO2 dip coated nanofilms is presented. Nanofilms were synthesized from bacterial cellulose using the electrospinning technique. The physical properties of the nanofilms were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The ratio of bacterial cellulose/nylon used in the spinning process was 0.165:1. The results from SEM showed that the structure of the TiO2 composite nanofilms was rutile crystalline with an average particle size of 20 nm, and synthesized nanofilms had an average size of 20-30 nm. The band gap energies of TiO2-dip coated nanofilms ranged from 3.18-3.21 eV. SEM results of TiO2 coated nanofilms suggested that the TiO2 was rather uniformly distributed onto the surface of the nanofilms. The actual amount of TiO2 coated on the nanofilms was estimated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for 1×1 cm2 surface area. It was found that 0.1852, 0.2897 and 0.7275 mg of TiO2 were coated on the surface of the nanofilms for 1, 2.5 and 5 % (weight) TiO2 dosage, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of the nanofilms was tested for the removal of gaseous toluene in a photocatalytic reactor. Experimental conditions were set as follows: UV light intensity of approximately 2.7 mW.cm-2, flow rate of 0.2 L.min-1, and an initial toluene concentration of about 200±20 ppm, and a retention time at 200 min. The degradation rate of toluene increased with increasing dosage of TiO2 from 1, 2.5 and 5 %. The nanofilms at a 5 % dosage yielded the highest removal efficiency of 92.71 %, followed by the 2.5 and 1 % dosage, respectively."
"Pharmacological treatments for alleviating agitation in dementia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis  2018 The British Pharmacological SocietyAims: To determine the most efficacious and acceptable treatments of agitation in dementia. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov were searched up to 7 February 2017. Two independent reviewers selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments to alleviate agitation in people with all-types dementia. Data were extracted using standardized forms and study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs. Data were pooled using meta-analysis. The primary outcome, efficacy, was 8-week response rates defined as a 50% reduction in baseline agitation score. The secondary outcome was treatment acceptability defined as treatment continuation for 8 weeks. Results: Thirty-six RCTs comprising 5585 participants (30.9% male; mean ± standard deviation age, 81.8 ± 4.9 years) were included. Dextromethorphan/quinidine [odds ratio (OR) 3.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.63–5.66], risperidone (OR 1.96; 95% CI, 1.49–2.59) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a class (OR 1.61; 95% CI, 1.02–2.53) were found to be significantly more efficacious than placebo. Haloperidol appeared less efficacious than nearly all comparators. Most treatments had noninferior treatment continuation compared to placebo, except oxcarbazepine, which was inferior. Findings were supported by subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Risperidone, serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a class and dextromethorphan/quinidine demonstrated evidence of efficacy for agitation in dementia, although findings for dextromethorphan/quinidine were based on a single RCT. Our findings do not support prescribing haloperidol due to lack of efficacy, or oxcarbazepine due to lack of acceptability. The decision to prescribe should be based on comprehensive consideration of the benefits and risks, including those not evaluated in this meta-analysis."
"Effect of partial substitution of milk-non-fat with xanthan gum on encapsulation of a probiotic Lactobacillus  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus when encapsulated in the combination of milk-non-fat (MNF) and xanthan gum was studied. The spray drying process was set for inlet air temperature at 160 °C and feed-in flow rate of 34 ml/min. The feed-in was the mixture of 10% v/v bacterial cell paste and cell protectants. When MNF was applied as a carrier, the viscosity of the suspension increased as the concentration increased. The 10% MNF gave the feed-in the lowest viscosity and provided the highest cell viability. The partial substitution with xanthan gum affected the viscosity and surface tension of the feed-in suspension. The substitution of xanthan gum at 0.50% provided the smallest and uniform particle and also improved the survival number to 98.05 ± 0.68%. The reduction of viable cell in products with partial substitution of xanthan and 10% MNF were 29.09 and 37.75%, respectively, after 15 weeks stored under 30 ± 2 °C. Practical applications: This result could be applied in the preservation of probiotic cultures to be used as supplements or starters."
"Design of state-feedback control for polynomial systems with quadratic performance criterion and control input constraints  2018 Elsevier B.V.This paper presents a novel convex optimization approach to design state-feedback control for polynomial systems. Design criteria are comprised of a quadratic cost function and bounded magnitudes of control inputs. Specifically, we formulate a control synthesis of closed-loop systems operated in a given bounded domain characterized by a semi-algebraic set. We consider an extended class of rational Lyapunov functions and derive an upper bound of the cost function, together with a state-feedback control law. By exploiting bounds on the control input magnitudes, the controller design condition can be cast as a parameter-dependent linear matrix inequality (PDLMI), which is convex optimization and can be efficiently solved by sum-of-squares (SOS) technique. In addition, we derive a sufficient condition to compute a lower bound of the cost function. When choosing polynomial structure of the solution candidate, the lower bound can also be written as PDLMI. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design."
"Functional characterization of the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter from the green picoalga Ostreococcus tauri  2018 Elsevier Inc.Transmembrane ion transport is a critical process in the cellular response to salt stress. Among the known functional membrane transporters that are involved in the salt stress response, Na+/H+ antiporters have been extensively studied. These ubiquitous membrane proteins are crucial for salt tolerance and are associated with the regulation of internal pH, cell volume, morphogenesis, and vesicular trafficking. Molecular and functional analyses of Na+/H+ antiporters have been characterized among taxa but little is known about algal Na+/H+ antiporters. Here, we analyzed putative Na+/H+ antiporters from the complete genome sequence of the marine picoalga Ostreococcus tauri. At least 10 putative Na+/H+ antiporters belonging to the SOS1, NHX, and KEA/Kef families were found. Surprisingly, a bacterial type NhaA sequence (OtNhaA) was also found. Topological modeling of OtNhaA predicted 12 possible transmembrane segments with a long N-terminus. The full-length (FL_OtNhaA) and N-terminal truncated (ΔN112_OtNhaA) versions of OtNhaA were constructed, expressed in the salt-sensitive mutant Escherichia coli TO114, and functionally characterized. Complementation analysis revealed that FL_OtNhaA- and ΔN112_OtNhaA-expressing cells exhibited increased tolerance to high NaCl concentrations up to 700 mM. Antiporter activity assays showed that both FL_OtNhaA and ΔN112_OtNhaA proteins predominantly exhibited Na+/H+ and Ca2+/H+ antiporter activities at alkaline pH conditions. Intriguingly, the ΔN112_OtNhaA exhibited higher Na+/H+ and Ca2+/H+ antiporter activities compared to FL_OtNhaA. Kinetic analysis revealed that FL_OtNhaA has a high affinity for Na+ and Ca2+ ions with a Km of 1.1 ± 0.23 mM for Na+ (at pH 8.5) and a Km of 0.3 ± 0.07 mM for Ca2+ (at pH 8.5). Since NhaA has shown striking diversity among taxa, our results provide insight into the functional properties of the algal NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter. These results will contribute to the understanding of Na+/H+ antiporters that have various implications in all kingdoms of life."
"Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) shedding in sow colostrum  2018 Elsevier B.V.The major objective of this work was to investigate the shedding of porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) in sow colostrum. PCV3 titers in the serum and colostrum samples of 38 sows were determined using qPCR. Interestingly, this is the first report regarding the identification of PCV3 from the colostrum samples. In the studied farm, the prevalence of PCV3 in the colostrum samples was 44.74% (17/38). When sows were grouped based on the PCV3 titers in the serum into the “High-viremic” “Low-viremic” and “Non-viremic” sows, it was shown that the High-viremic sows showed significantly higher PCV3 colostrum prevalence (100%; 9/9) with the PCV3 titers ranging from 4.01 to 7.33 genomic copies/mL. The results indicated that PCV3 in the colostrum might be partly influenced by the viremic stage of the infection. However, the results also showed that approximately 41% of sows shedding PCV3 with low titers in the colostrum (7/17) were non-viremic sows. In conclusion, this study identified the presence of PCV3 in sow colostrum. Clinical impacts and mechanisms of colostrum shedding of PCV3 should be further investigated."
"Predictive values and specificity of electroencephalographic findings in autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis  2018 Elsevier Inc.Objective: Early diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) to not delay treatment is challenging but needed in practice. Most previous evidences of electroencephalographic (EEG) findings in AE were derived from descriptive studies. Given paucity of evidence of specific EEG findings to help with early diagnosis of AE, this study aimed to ascertain specific EEG findings and assess their predictive values in diagnosis of AE. Methods: We included all cases with AE in our institution from January 2013 to June 2017. Cases were matched with controls by age and level of consciousness (1:2 ratio). Potential confounders for EEG findings collected as baseline characteristics were compared. Two epileptologists independently reviewed EEGs. Standardized terminology, definitions, and scoring system of EEG findings were employed. Logistic regression analysis was performed, and diagnostic performance of significant EEG features was assessed. Results: Twenty cases and 40 controls were included in this study. Poorly sustained posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) was significantly associated with AE (p = 0.007) and even more predictive in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) encephalitis. Inter-rater agreement (kappa) was 0.714. None of the cases had normal EEG nor Grand Total EEG (GTE) score < 4 (negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%). Specificity of well sustained PDR to exclude the diagnosis of anti-NMDA encephalitis was high (91.67%). Conclusions: Simple EEG assessment can be used to help exclude AE. When AE is suspected, careful assessment of the sustainment of the PDR is warranted. The NPV of GTE score < 4 and specificity of well sustained PDR can be simply used to differentiate many conditions from AE."
"Young macaques (Macaca fascicularis) preferentially bias attention towards closer, older, and better tool users  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Examining how animals direct social learning during skill acquisition under natural conditions, generates data for examining hypotheses regarding how transmission biases influence cultural change in animal populations. We studied a population of macaques on Koram Island, Thailand, and examined model-based biases during interactions by unskilled individuals with tool-using group members. We first compared the prevalence of interactions (watching, obtaining food, object exploration) and proximity to tool users during interactions, in developing individuals (infants, juveniles) versus mature non-learners (adolescents, adults), to provide evidence that developing individuals are actively seeking information about tool use from social partners. All infants and juveniles, but only 49% of mature individuals carried out interacted with tool users. Macaques predominantly obtained food by scrounging or stealing, suggesting maximizing scrounging opportunities motivates interactions with tool users. However, while interactions by adults was limited to obtaining food, young macaques and particularly infants also watched tool users and explored objects, indicating additional interest in tool use itself. We then ran matrix correlations to identify interaction biases, and what attributes of tool users influenced these. Biases correlated with social affiliation, but macaques also preferentially targeted tool users that potentially increase scrounging and learning opportunities. Results suggest that social structure may constrain social learning, but the motivation to bias interactions towards tool users to maximize feeding opportunities may also socially modulate learning by facilitating close proximity to better tool users, and further interest in tool-use actions and materials, especially during development."
"Development of mass transfer model for chromatographic separation of free lutein and fatty acids in de-esterified marigold lutein  2018 Institution of Chemical EngineersThis article was aimed to construct a mathematical mass transfer model for chromatographic separation of free lutein and fatty acids in de-esterified marigold lutein. Required model parameters: adsorption isotherm, overall mass transfer and axial dispersion coefficients, were first determined. The adsorption isotherms of the compounds were studied using batch adsorption experiments, while the axial dispersion and overall mass transfer coefficients were determined from published empirical-correlation and correlation developed experimentally from this study, respectively. The adsorption isotherms were found to be linear within the equilibrium concentration of ≤100 μg/ml. The isotherm constants of fatty acids were about twice those of free lutein. The isotherm constants and the mass transport parameters were then applied to the mass transfer model. The predicted results were compared with the experimental data at the optimum mobile phase velocity (0.16 cm/s). Good agreement was found, i.e., the average absolute deviations were less than 2% and 7% for semi-preparative and preparative columns, respectively."
"Substituent effects on chiral resolutions of derivatized 1-phenylalkylamines by heptakis(2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-β-cyclodextrin GC stationary phase  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Chiral resolutions of trifluoroacetyl-derivatized 1-phenylalkylamines with different type and position of substituent were investigated by capillary gas chromatography by using heptakis(2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-β-cyclodextrin diluted in OV-1701 as a chiral stationary phase. The influence of column temperature on retention and enantioselectivity was examined. All enantiomers of meta-substituted analytes as well as fluoro-substituted analytes could be resolved. Temperature had a favorable influence on enantioselectivity for small amines with substituents at the ortho-position. The type of substituent at the stereogenic center of amines also had a crucial effect as the ethyl group led to poor enantioseparation. Among all analytes studied, trifluoroacetyl-derivatized 1-(2′-fluorophenyl)ethylamine exhibited baseline resolution with the shortest analysis time."
"Enhancement of biocompatibility on aligned electrospun poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) scaffold immobilized with laminin towards murine neuroblastoma Neuro2a cell line and rat brain-derived neural stem cells (mNSCs) Copyright  2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Electrospinning has been extensively used to construct tissue-engineered scaffolds because of its ability to provide the fibrous scaffold with structurally analogous to the naturally occurring protein in the extracellular matrix of native tissues. In addition, the modification of scaffolds with bioactive molecules is beneficial as this can create an environment that consists of biochemical cues to further promote cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. In the present contribution, we prepared and investigated the potential used of aligned electrospun poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) scaffold immobilized with bioactive molecule to serve as nervous scaffold. Laminin was successfully immobilized on the surface using covalent binding between functional groups of modified scaffolds and protein. The ability to use for neural regeneration was evaluated in vitro towards murine neuroblastoma Neuro2a cell line and mouse brain-derived neural stem cells. The surface modification with laminin immobilized on the PHB fibrous scaffolds supported the attachment and promoted the proliferation of Neuro2a very wells. Despite the good attachment and proliferation of Neuro2a and mouse brain-derived neural stem cells were not able to proliferate on the neat PHB, hydrolyzed PHB and laminin immobilized on hydrolyzed PHB fibrous scaffold."
"Effect of operating parameters of potassium carbonate supported on gamma alumina (K2CO3/γ-Al2O3) on CO2 capture capacity using depressurized regeneration  2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical EngineersPotassium carbonate (K2CO3) loaded at 17% by weight (wt.%) on a gamma alumina (γ-Al2O3) support was prepared by impregnation and then employed to adsorb carbon dioxide (CO2) under a turbulent fluidized bed regime in a glass riser–sorber. The spent K2CO3/γ-Al2O3 sorbent was regenerated in situ by depressurization at 0.8 or 0.2 atm for 2 or 20 min. The CO2 sorption occurred by both chemical sorption and physical adsorption and the total sorption capacity was not significantly dependent on the sorbent regeneration time (2 or 20 min) or regeneration cycles (1–3), but was strongly dependent upon the regeneration pressure, being better at 0.2 than at 0.8 atm. There was no detectable formation of inactive species, such as KAl(CO3)(OH)2H2O), on the regenerated sorbent and the meso-pore type IV surface area was not affected by the number of regeneration cycles. Rather the relocation of water on the sorbent surface in the hydrothermal treatment after sorbent regeneration is hypothesized to have played an important role in the CO2 capture capacity. This was because the accumulation of water near the pore entrance rather than deep inside the pore reduced the average pore diameter and increased the average pore volume when regenerated at 0.8 atm, but not at 0.2 atm. The regenerated sorbent (at 0.2 atm for 2 min) had a CO2 capture capacity of about 95% of that of the fresh adsorbent. As the result of the short regeneration time, the depressurization regeneration unit can be much more compact than the conventional heat regeneration unit."
"Resource Holding Potential and the Outcome of Aggressive Interactions between Paired Male Aegus chelifer chelifer (Coleoptera: Lucanidae) Stag Beetles  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Interactions between male stag beetles usually involve aggressive behavior using their long mandibles as weapons to compete with rival males over females. Considerable variation exists within populations in male body size, and may affect their behavior and the outcome of male-male contests. We investigated the aggressive interactions between male Aegus chelifer chelifer, a small tropical stag beetle species. Morphological traits in relation to aggressiveness and the outcome of fights were examined in laboratory-reared beetles. The fight-engagement ratios of major and minor morph males were not significantly different and analyses revealed that the size of body parts had more effect on the fighting success than the weapon part (mandibles). The probability of winning a contest was higher in males with a larger head width (HW), and so HW was considered as the resource holding potential (RHP). No effects of the trait size on the initiation of fights or aggressive intensity was found. Relationships between the fight duration and RHP were not significantly consistent with any assessment strategies, but were close to the mutual assessment model."
"Contribution of humic substances to dissolved organic matter optical properties and iron mobilization  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.Humic substances (HS) are the primary constituents of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and play pivotal roles in aquatic systems. Optical indices of DOM, such as specific UV absorbance (SUVA254), the fluorescence index (FI) and biological index (BIX), have gained wide interest because of their ease of use. In this study, we explored the relationship between HS and the indices in the Trat River Basin (eastern Thailand) from headwaters to the river mouth through the distinct dry and rainy seasons to examine whether changes in index values reflect variability in the relative contribution of HS to DOM, or %HS. The results show that %HS and the indices did not exhibit significant linear relationships (FI and BIX, P > 0.05), or the relationships changed seasonally (SUVA254). However, analyzing the indices versus %HS did show clear DOM composition changes by season with more humic-like or terrestrial material in the rainy season. Relationships between DOM and dissolved iron (dFe) concentrations were also explored. Separating the relationships of DOM versus dFe into HS versus dFe and non-HS versus dFe provides us the opportunity to better understand which fraction contributes more to dFe mobilization. The results indicate stronger positive linear relationships between HS and dFe concentrations independent of river tributary. Overall, this study highlights the importance of quantifying HS for the study of DOM dynamics or compositional changes along a river transect as well as for DOM-induced iron mobilization."
"Short-term effects of particulate matter exposure on daily mortality in Thailand: a case-crossover study  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.Several studies have shown seasonal variations between particulate matter (PM) exposure and daily mortality. However, few studies have focused on age differences on the risk of mortality from PM10, in addition to seasonal effects. Therefore, we attempted to estimate the association between PM10 and daily mortality in Thailand, while accounting for seasonal variations and age differences. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used in this study. Environmental, meteorological, and mortality data of 12 provinces in Thailand between 2011 and 2014 were analyzed to estimate the association between PM10 and daily mortality attributed to non-accidental, cardiovascular, respiratory causes and age differences. The conditional logistic regression was employed to determine whether the risk of mortality differed by seasons and age groups. We found an association between cumulative exposure to PM10 and increased risk of mortality attributed to non-accidental causes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. During the study period, cold months (November to February) [1.75% (95% CI 1.20, 2.31)] had a stronger effect of increased 10 μg/m3 in PM10 with 1 ppb in O3 on non-accidental mortality than hot (March to June) [0.67% (95% CI 0.15, 1.20)] and wet (July to October) [− 1.00% (95% CI − 1.99, − 0.01)] months. However, increasing of age did not modify any associations between PM10 and mortality. An association between PM10 exposure and daily mortality was observed. Age difference was not significantly associated with the risk of mortality."
"Current challenges and opportunities in treating glioblastomas  2018 by The Author(s).Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, has a high mortality rate despite extensive efforts to develop new treatments. GBM exhibits both intraand intertumor heterogeneity, lending to resistance and eventual tumor recurrence. Large-scale genomic and proteomic analysis of GBM tumors has uncovered potential drug targets. Effective and “druggable” targets must be validated to embark on a robust medicinal chemistry campaign culminating in the discovery of clinical candidates. Here, we review recent developments inGBMdrugdiscoveryanddelivery.ToidentifyGBMdrug targets, we performed extensive bioinformatics analysis using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We discovered 20 genes, BOC, CLEC4GP1, ELOVL6, EREG, ESR2, FDCSP, FURIN, FUT8-AS1, GZMB, IRX3, LITAF, NDEL1, NKX3-1, PODNL1, PTPRN, QSOX1, SEMA4F, TH, VEGFC, and C20orf166AS1 that are overexpressed in a subpopulation of GBM patients and correlate with poor survival outcomes. Importantly, nine of these genes exhibit higher expression in GBM versus low-grade glioma and may be involved in disease progression. In this review, we discuss these proteins in the context of GBM disease progression. We also conducted computational multi-parameter optimization to assess the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of small molecules in clinical trials for GBM treatment. Drug delivery in the context of GBM is particularly challenging because the BBB hinders small molecule transport. Therefore, we discuss novel drug delivery methods, including nanoparticles and prodrugs. Given the aggressive nature of GBM and the complexity of targeting the central nervous system, effective treatment options are a major unmet medical need. Identification and validation of biomarkers and drug targets associated with GBM disease progression present an exciting opportunity to improve treatment of this devastating disease."
"Bioinformatics characterization of a cathepsin B transcript from the giant river prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii: Homology modeling and expression analysis after Aeromonas hydrophila infection  2018 Elsevier Inc.Cathepsin B is a lysosomal proteolytic enzyme that has been suggested to play a role in pathological processes of immune system. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence of cathepsin B transcript in the giant river prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (MrCTSB) was obtained from 454 pyrosequencing of cDNAs from hepatopancreas and muscle. It was 1158 bp in length, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 987 bp corresponding to 328 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass and pI of MrCTSB protein was 36.04 kDa and 4.73. The major characteristics of MrCTSB protein consisted of a propeptide of C1 peptidase family at the N-terminus and a cysteine protease (Pept_C1) domain at the C-terminus. The 3-dimentional structure of MrCTSB was constructed by computer-assisted homology modeling. The folding of MrCTSB was highly conserved to human CTSB structure and the modeled MrCTSB displayed characteristics of cysteine proteinases superfamily. The docking study was performed to investigate binding interactions between known inhibitors against MrCTSB. Known inhibitors were oriented in the groove of catalytic site cleft. They bound to subsites from S2, S1, S1′ and S2′ respectively, with key residues in each subsite. Challenge of juvenile prawns with Aeromonas hydrophila revealed that the MrCTSB transcript in hepatopancreas significantly increased at 60–96 h post injection (hpi). This suggested that MrCTSB may play roles in innate immunity of M. rosenbergii. Our results provide useful information for a more comprehensive study in immune-related functions of MrCTSB."
"Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Body Proton Therapy for High-Risk, Medically Inoperable, Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  2018 Elsevier Inc.Purpose: To report the feasibility of conducting a randomized study to compare the toxicity and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) versus stereotactic body proton therapy (SBPT) for high-risk, medically inoperable, early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Patients with medically inoperable NSCLC with high-risk features (centrally located or <5 cm T3 tumor or isolated lung parenchymal recurrences) were randomly assigned to SBRT or SBPT. Radiation dose was 50 Gy(relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) in 4 12.5-Gy(RBE) fractions prescribed to the planning target volume. Stereotactic body radiation therapy was given using 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or intensity modulated radiation therapy, and SBPT was given using passive scattering. Consistency in patient setup was ensured with on-board cone beam computed tomography for the SBRT group and with orthogonal X rays for the SBPT group. Results: The study closed early owing to poor accrual, largely because of insurance coverage and lack of volumetric imaging in the SBPT group. Ultimately, 21 patients were enrolled, and 19 patients who received 50 Gy in 4 fractions were included for analysis (9 SBRT, 10 SBPT). At a median follow-up time of 32 months, median overall survival time was 28 months in the SBRT group and not reached in the SBPT group. Three-year overall survival was 27.8% and 90%, 3-year local control was 87.5% (8 of 9) and 90.0% (9 of 10), and 3-year regional control was 47.6% (5 of 9) and 90% (9 of 10) in the SBRT and SBPT groups, respectively. One patient in the SBPT group developed grade 3 skin fibrosis. No patients experienced grade 4/5 toxicity. Conclusion: Poor accrual, due to lack of volumetric imaging and insurance coverage for proton therapy, led to early closure of the trial and precluded accurate assessment of efficacy and toxicity. Comparable maturity of 2 radiation therapy modalities, particularly on-board imaging, and better insurance coverage for SBPT should be considered for future studies."
"Discussion on ‘‘Seismic displacement along a log-spiral failure surface with crack using rock Hoek–Brown failure criterion’’  2018 Elsevier LtdThis discussion is based on the paper by Zhao et al. [4] (hereafter identified as “the authors” or “the original paper”). In the original paper, the authors presented a numerical model to calculate the seismic displacement for rock slopes with cracks using the Hoek-Brown yield criterion. For the proposed numerical model, the upper bound limit analysis and rigid block displacement technique were employed in which the actual horizontal and vertical earthquake ground motion records were utilized in the analyses. This discussion addresses the theoretical issues of the computed permanent seismic displacements in conjunction with the upper bound limit analysis using the rigid block displacement technique. In addition, the discussion comments on some issues related to the assumption of using the factor of safety being less than 1 for a calculation of induced seismic displacement under an actual time history of horizontal and vertical accelerations, and the use of fixed crack depth ratios of 0.1 and 0.2 in the parametric studies of the original paper."
"The Road Less Traveled: Should We Omit Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer?  2018 Elsevier Inc.New randomized data from Japan have raised questions regarding the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer but without detectable brain metastases on magnetic resonance imaging. In the present focused review, we examine the general role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in the management of small-cell lung cancer and present relevant controversies from both sides of the discussion. Future directions for clinical investigation and research are also highlighted. Strategies for neurocognitive protection, including memantine use and hippocampal sparing using modulated radiotherapy techniques, are also presented."
"Measurement of the inelastic proton-proton cross section at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A measurement of the inelastic proton-proton cross section with the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of s=13 TeV is presented. The analysis is based on events with energy deposits in the forward calorimeters, which cover pseudorapidities of −6.6 < η < −3.0 and +3.0 < η < +5.2. An inelastic cross section of 68.6 ± 0.5(syst) ± 1.6(lumi) mb is obtained for events with MX> 4.1 GeV and/or MY> 13 GeV, where MX and MY are the masses of the diffractive dissociation systems at negative and positive pseudorapidities, respectively. The results are compared with those from other experiments as well as to predictions from high-energy hadron-hadron interaction models."
"Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence in Thailand  2018, The Author(s).There is no recent national data on the prevalence of intimate partner violence in Thailand. This study proposed to examine the prevalence of intimate partner violence in 4 regions of Thailand by using a standardized questionnaire from the WHO multi country study on women’s health and domestic violence. Two thousand four hundred and sixty-two married or cohabiting women aged 20–59 years were interviewed about their experiences of psychologically, physically, sexually violent, and/or controlling behaviors by their male partners. The study found that 15% of respondents had experienced psychological, physical, and/or sexual violence in their life time which suggests that 1 in 6 of Thai women have faced intimate partner violence. Of the 15% of women who reported intimate partner violence within the past 12 months, psychological violence was the most common (60–68%), followed by sexual violence (62–63%) and physical violence (52–65%). In addition, the percentage of women who faced various forms of controlling behaviors varied from 4.6% to 29.3%. Men who were more controlling were more likely to abuse their female partners. The results reveal that partner violence against women is a significant public health issue in Thai society that must be addressed."
"Hemocyanin of Litopenaeus vannamei agglutinates Vibrio parahaemolyticus AHPND (VPAHPND) and neutralizes its toxin  2018 Elsevier LtdAcute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease, AHPND, caused by a specific strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND), results in great loss of global shrimp production. Despite this, studies on shrimp defense mechanisms protecting against AHPND are few. In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed to identify differentially expressed genes from white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei hepatopancreas upon VPAHPND infection at the early stages: 3 and 6 h post challenge and in the late stage at 48 h post challenge. Hemocyanin (HMC) is the most abundant gene identified as the up-regulated gene in the SSH library. Various hemocyanin subunits such as hemocyanin (HMC), hemocyanin subunit L1 (HMCL1), L2 (HMCL2), L3 (HMCL3), and L4 (HMCL4) were analyzed for their expression levels upon VPAHPND infection and in response to challenge with partially purified toxin of VPAHPND by qRT-PCR. Only HMC was highly up-regulated at 3 and 6 h post challenge in response to VPAHPND challenge. Two HMC subunits, HMCL3 and HMCL4, were up-regulated in the early phase of VPAHPND toxin injection. Furthermore, all subunits were down-regulated in the late phase of VPAHPND and toxin challenges. The native hemocyanin protein purified from shrimp hemolymph, identified as mixture of HMC and HMCL1, exhibited agglutination activity on VPAHPND. Injecting the purified native hemocyanin along with VPAHPND into shrimp decreased the number of bacteria in the hemolymph as compared to the VPAHPND challenged control. Moreover, pre-incubation of the purified native hemocyanin and VPAHPND toxin prior to injection into shrimp resulted in the decrease of cumulative mortality of shrimp when compared to the control. In addition, protein-protein interaction analysis carried out by ELISA technique indicated that hemocyanin exhibited VPAHPND toxin-neutralizing activity through direct interaction with PirA subunit with a dissociation constant of 6.83 × 10−6 M. Our results indicated that upon VPAHPND infection the expression of hemocyanin was induced and hemocyanin functions might involve agglutination of invading VPAHPND and also neutralization of VPAHPND secreted toxin via direct interacting with the PirA protein."
"Comparative study on the maximum mouth opening between dynamic and static jaw exercise in irradiated head and neck cancer patients: A randomized control trial  2017 Asian AOMS, ASOMP, JSOP, JSOMS, JSOM, and JAMIObjective: To compare the effects of dynamic and static jaw exercises on maximum mouth opening distance (MMOD) in irradiated head and neck cancer patients. Materials and methods: Forty-three head and neck cancer patients who received radiotherapy were divided into two groups, dynamic jaw exercise group (n = 20) or static jaw exercise group (n = 23). The MMOD of the patients in each group, measured by Therabite range of motion scale, revealed excellent validity and reliability pre-radiotherapy, every two weeks during radiotherapy, the last day of radiotherapy, and the 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. The percentage of MMOD change in the groups pre-treatment and 1 year post-treatment were compared using the independent t-test (α = 0.05). Result: The average reduction in MMOD in the static group was 7.17% ± 21.34, and in the dynamic group was 9.42% ± 16.91. The independent t-test analysis revealed no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.706). Conclusion: There was no significant difference in MMOD between head and neck radiotherapy patients using dynamic or static jaw exercises."
"Urinary stone risk factors in the descendants of patients with kidney stone disease  2018, IPNA.Background: Evidence has indicated that immediate family members of nephrolithiasis patients had high opportunity to develop stones. However, they are usually not regarded to be at risk, since it is unclear if there are any lithogenic abnormalities found in non-stone-forming nephrolithiasis relatives. Our aim was to investigate urinary metabolic abnormalities in the children of nephrolithiasis patients, compared with the general population. Methods: The 24-h urinary metabolic profile was studied for 28 calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis patients (NL) and 46 of their descendants (ND), as well as 40 non-stone-forming volunteers (V) and 34 of their descendants (VD). Results: There was no difference between age, gender, and serum creatinine between NL vs. V (parental groups) and ND vs. VD (descendant groups). High urinary oxalate in nephrolithiasis and urinary calcium in their descendants was detected. In addition, an elevated urinary excretion rate of calcium, phosphate, protein, and albumin, along with low citrate excretion and high urinary supersaturation was observed in both the nephrolithiasis patients and their descendants. Approximate 17.8–24.4% of the nephrolithiasis descendants had a urinary supersaturation higher than the nephrolithiasis level, but none was found in VD group. The level of urinary supersaturation index was correlated with urinary protein and albumin excretion in nephrolithiasis family. Conclusion: It was demonstrated that nephrolithiasis offspring carried several urinary metabolic risks predisposing to stone formation which are similar to their parents, and about one in every five nephrolithiasis children had nephrolithiasis level urinary supersaturation."
"Improved fermentation performance to produce bioethanol from Gelidium amansii using Pichia stipitis adapted to galactose  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.This study employed a statistical method to obtain optimal hyper thermal acid hydrolysis conditions using Gelidium amansii (red seaweed) as a source of biomass. The optimal hyper thermal acid hydrolysis using G. amansii as biomass was determined as 12% (w/v) slurry content, 358.3 mM H2SO4, and temperature of 142.6 °C for 11 min. After hyper thermal acid hydrolysis, enzymatic saccharification was carried out. The total monosaccharide concentration was 45.1 g/L, 72.2% of the theoretical value of the total fermentable monosaccharides of 62.4 g/L based on 120 g dry weight/L in the G. amansii slurry. To increase ethanol production, 3.8 g/L 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in the hydrolysate was removed by treatment with 3.5% (w/v) activated carbon for 2 min and fermented with Pichia stipitis adapted to high galactose concentrations via separate hydrolysis and fermentation. With complete HMF removal and the use of P. stipitis adapted to high galactose concentrations, 22 g/L ethanol was produced (yield 0.50). Fermentation with total HMF removal and yeast adapted to high galactose concentrations increased the fermentation performance and decreased the fermentation time from 96 to 36 h compared to traditional fermentation."
"Sequential extraction and reactive extraction processing of spent coffee grounds: An alternative approach for pretreatment of biodiesel feedstocks and biodiesel production  2018An alternative approach to producing biodiesel from spent coffee grounds (SCGs) has been developed with methanol washing applied as a pretreatment step, followed by in-situ transesterification. Under optimal conditions, methanol washing was able to reduce the high acid value of SCGs to 0.78 mg KOH g−1 with a negligible loss of their oil content, which ended up being 11.43% by mass. Pretreated SCGs were then directly treated with a potassium methoxide solution and isopropanol as co-solvents in the in-situ transesterification process. A central composited rotatable design was applied to determine the optimal conditions for KOH concentration and proportion of isopropanol. The results showed that both KOH concentration and proportion of isopropanol had significant effects on the biodiesel yields, residual triglyceride in the biodiesel, and extraction performance (p-value <0.05). The optimal conditions were provided by KOH concentration of 2.5 g in a 100 mL mixture of methanol and 25% volume of isopropanol, using 2.7 mL of the reagent to 1 g of SCGs at 30 °C for 2 h. Under these conditions, 88.8% biodiesel yield (i.e., 102 mg of biodiesel per 1 g of SCGs), with a less than 0.1% mass of residual triglycerides in the biodiesel, was achieved."
"Preparation of hydrothermal carbon acid catalyst from defatted rice bran  2018 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the effects of carbonization conditions: temperature (180–250 °C) and time (1–8 h) on the yield and the chemical characteristics of hydrothermal carbon derived from defatted rice bran (HTCDRB) were determined. The morphological and chemical characteristics of the sulfonated HTCDRB catalyst were also examined. In addition, the stability of the catalyst was evaluated based on the amounts of biomass conversion products (5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural, levulinic acid and formic acid) leached into water at a specified biomass conversion condition. Since no HMF and furfural, and only small amounts of levulinic acid (1.75 wt.%), and formic acid (0.42 wt.%), were leached from the catalyst synthesized from HTCDRB prepared at the carbonization condition of 220 °C for 3 h, this condition was suggested to be a suitable carbonization condition. Despite having similar structural and chemical characteristics, the leaching test suggested that the DRB-based hydrothermal carbon catalyst was found to be more stable than the glucose-based hydrothermal carbon catalyst, prepared at the same condition. The catalytic activity for cellulose hydrolysis of the catalyst was higher than that of the commercial Amberlyst 16 WET catalyst."
"An analysis of white-handed gibbon male song reveals speech-like phrases  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Objectives: Our goal was to document song phrases of the white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar), an Asian ape that produces elaborate songs, often in well-coordinated male/female duets. We focused on the male coda, which is produced during vocal turn-taking with one's mate, and particularly its phrases containing rapid spectral and temporal variation, to investigate if modulation rates resemble those of lip-smacking in other nonhuman primates and human speech rhythm. Materials and methods: We produced recordings from a large population of wild gibbons. Using terminology consistent with that used to describe vocalizations in other singing species, we analyzed coda phrases, overall coda properties, coda distinctiveness across individuals, and flexibility of phrase production within song bouts. Results: Our song phrase-level analysis showed that male codas differed between individuals and increase in complexity within song bouts by the addition of the only two male-specific phrases of the species’ repertoire. These phrases differ from all others of the species and from vocalizations typical of the larger, nonhuman great apes, in that they contain rapid within-phrase modulation. Their modulation rates (6.82 and 7.34 Hz) are similar to that of lip-smacking in other nonhuman primates and speech in humans and, like human speech, are produced exclusively during exhalation. One phrase type (trills) contains multiple notes per exhalation, another characteristic similar to speech but not most primate vocalizations. Discussion: Our data highlight the complexity and flexibility of gibbon song, and show that particular phrase features likely arose from sexual selection pressures and possess similarities to human speech rhythm."
"A Synchro-Perspective-Based High-Frequency Voltage Injection Method for Position-Sensorless Vector Control of Doubly Fed Induction Machines  1972-2012 IEEE.In this paper, a novel salient autonomous high-frequency (HF) signal injection method of sensorless drive for doubly fed induction machines (DFIM) is proposed. The HF voltage is injected into the rotor winding, and according to the concept of synchro, the rotor position can be simply extracted from the phase difference among the stator current and the rotor current regardless of machine and grid parameters. In addition, the proposed scheme is robust against the disturbance of HF stator voltage propagated from the grid. The vector phase-locked loop (PLL) technique is employed to calculate rotor position and rotor speed simultaneously, and the global stability of the PLL is mentioned. The tracking performances during acceleration and deceleration, and sinusoidal perturbation are investigated. The feasibility of the proposed concept is verified by the experimental results with a 4-kW DFIM drive. The performances of the drive system are evaluated in various operating conditions, e.g., subsynchronous, synchronous and supersynchronous speeds, voltage sag, and flying start."
"Cyanidin-3-rutinoside reduces insulin fibrillation and attenuates insulin fibrils-induced oxidative hemolysis of human erythrocytes  2018 Elsevier B.V.Insulin is able to form amyloid-like fibrils, a misfolding process by which insulin molecules interact with each other to form aggregates and pathological amyloid deposition. Inhibition of amyloid aggregation using natural products is proposed as a new strategy to prohibit the development of amyloid diseases. Herein, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R), a natural anthocyanin with multiple biological activities, against insulin amyloid fibrillation. The results showed that increased insulin concentration resulted in faster growth and higher amounts of insulin fibrils. C3R (10.6–170 μM) concentration dependently decreased insulin fibril growth and increased the duration of lag time of insulin fibril formation. Moreover, C3R directly decreased the secondary structure transition from α-helix to β-sheet structure. C3R (0.31–5 μM) attenuated insulin fibrils-induced oxidative hemolysis of human erythrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, C3R reduced insulin fibrils-induced erythrocyte membrane disruption through the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The findings also suggest that C3R reduced fibrils-induced membrane lipid peroxidation by maintaining the catalase activity and oxidized/reduced glutathione content (GSH/GSSH) in erythrocytes. These findings suggest that C3R may serve as a potential inhibitory agent against amyloid fibril formation and insulin fibrils-induced oxidative hemolysis."
"How numeracy mediates cash flow format preferences: A worldwide study  2018 Elsevier Ltd688 students from 9 countries on 5 continents participated in this research. The objective was to ascertain what effects, if any, using the direct or indirect format for the operating activities section of the cash flow statement has, if any, on a loan decision and on the ratings of various attributes of the cash flow statement. Students were pretested on their accounting skills with a few simple calculations, then asked to make the loan decision and finally requested to give their opinion of the financial statements in general and of the statement of cash flows in particular. Format had only a minor effect on the loan decision itself but significantly more favorable comments on user friendliness were received on the direct format than on the indirect. Significant differences were found, however, as regards the loan decisions between the students who had correctly done the calculations and those who had not, to such a degree that the effects of innumeracy became the main contribution to knowledge of this research. We find that the ability to perform accurate calculations, a fundamental foundation of financial numeracy, has an effect on financial decision making that has been ignored in previous studies of financial statement users and uses. This has significant implications for accounting and investing practice, and opens up an important field of research in accounting which can learn from what has already been studied on the effects of innumeracy in the health management field."
"Ionic liquid phases with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.New generation inert ionic liquid (iIL) GC columns IL60i, IL76i and IL111i, comprising phosphonium or imidazolium cationic species, were investigated for separation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). In general, the iIL phases provide comparable retention times to their corresponding conventional columns, with only minor selectivity differences. The average tailing factors and peak widths were noticeably improved (reduced) for IL60i and IL76i, while they were slightly improved for IL111i. Inert IL phase columns were coupled with conventional IL columns in comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC × GC) with a solid-state modulator which offers variable modulation temperature (TM), programmable TM during analysis and trapping stationary phase material during the trap/release (modulation) process, independent of oven T and column sets. Although IL phases are classified as polar, relative polarity of the two phases comprising individual GC × GC column sets permits combination of less-polar IL/polar IL and polar IL/less-polar IL column sets; it was observed that a polar/less-polar column set provided better separation of FAME. A higher first dimension (1D) phase polarity combined with a lower 2D phase polarity, for instance 1D IL111i with 2D IL59 gave the best result; the greater difference in 1D/2D phase polarity results in increasing occupancy of peak area in the 2D space. The IL111i/IL59 column set was selected for analysis of fatty acids in fat and oil products (butter, margarine, fish oil and canola oil). Compared with the conventional IL111, IL111i showed reduced column bleed which makes this more suited to GC × GC analysis of FAME. The proposed method offers a fast profiling approach with good repeatability of analysis of FAME."
"Upregulation of Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Expression Following Chronic Paracetamol Treatment in Astrocyte  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The present study aimed to investigate the effect of APAP treatment on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the astrocytes. The mouse astrocyte cells (C8-D1A) were treated with APAP at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h, 16 and 28 days. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB were determined using western blot analysis. Furthermore, the expression and localization of phosphorylation of NF-kB were detected by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysis. The ultrastructure of C8-D1A cells was as well monitored. The results revealed that acute APAP treatment (24 h) had no effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pNF-kB. This treatment did not alter the ultrastructure of C8-D1A cells when compared with those in the control cells. However, the results obtained from the study on chronic APAP-treated cells (16 and 28 days) showed the different effect of APAP treatment. The results obtained from western blot analysis showed the increment of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β and TNF-α) expressions and the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway. Nuclear translocation of pNF-kB and alteration of several cell structures were well observed in the C8-D1A cells with chronic APAP treatment. The results obtained from this study suggest that chronic APAP treatment can induce an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα) in astrocytes. This alteration implies the involvement of the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway."
"Incidence of infusion hypersensitivity reaction after withholding dexamethasone premedication in early breast cancer patients not experiencing two previous cycles of infusion hypersensitivity reaction for weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Background: Premedication with dexamethasone is an essential part of the prevention of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) associated with taxane administration. However, the possibility of stopping dexamethasone premedication has been investigated in previous studies to reduce the steroid’s adverse events; however, either the result or the particular protocol was limited. Thus, our study aimed to evaluate the incidence of HSR after dexamethasone premedication discontinuation after lack of HSR in two previous weekly paclitaxel infusions. Method: Early breast cancer patients who received adjuvant weekly paclitaxel in a retrospective cohort from January 2012 through February 2016 at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were reviewed. All patients received a standard premedication protocol prior to the first and second paclitaxel infusion. Dexamethasone was omitted in later cycles in all patients who did not undergo infusion HSR. Patients who developed HSR during the first or second cycles of paclitaxel infusion were excluded. The incidence of HSR during the later cycle of paclitaxel administration and factors associated with this adverse reaction were collected. Results: Eighty-one of 85 patients who did not undergo infusion HSR after 2 cycles of weekly paclitaxel administration were retrospectively reviewed. The median age was 51 years (range 27–74 years). Only 16% of the patients had a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2, 57.8% were premenopausal, 67.9% had no comorbidity, none had a history of allergy or asthma, 65.4% received weekly paclitaxel as a single agent, and 34.6% received weekly paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab. Five of 81 patients reported grade I–II HSR (6.25%), which occurred mostly during the first 6 cycles (60%). Temporary discontinuation of paclitaxel infusion was observed in all HSR patients. No differences regarding age, BMI, menopausal status, and underlying disease between the HSR and no HSR groups were identified. Concerning the safety profile, peripheral neuropathy (gr I 60%, gr II 13.5%, and gr III 2.4%), myalgia (43.4%), and edema (10.5%) were commonly reported, whereas dyspepsia (5.3%) and insomnia (14.5%) were rarely described in withholding patients. Conclusion: Withholding dexamethasone premedication in non-experiencing HSR patients after two previous cycles of weekly paclitaxel administration was safe and did not impact the higher incidence of HSR. A discontinuing dexamethasone protocol should be recommended generally in these patients, especially those with a high risk for steroid-induced side effects."
"Bifunctional alanine dehydrogenase from the halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica: characterization and molecular properties  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.A link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism is important for serving as metabolic ancillary reactions. Here, we identified and characterized the alanine dehydrogenase gene in Aphanothece halophytica (ApalaDH) that is involved in alanine assimilation/dissimilation. Functional analysis revealed that ApalaDH encodes a bifunctional protein catalyzing the reversible reaction of pyruvate to l-alanine via its pyruvate reductive aminase (PvRA) activity, the reaction of l-alanine to pyruvate via its alanine oxidative dehydrogenase activity, and the non-reversible reaction of glyoxylate to glycine via its glyoxylate reductive aminase (GxRA) activity. Kinetic analysis showed the lowest affinity for pyruvate followed by l-alanine and glyoxylate with a Km of 0.22 ± 0.02, 0.72 ± 0.04, and 1.91 ± 0.43 mM, respectively. ApalaDH expression was upregulated by salt. Only PvRA and GxRA activities were detected in vivo and both activities increased about 1.2- and 2.7-fold upon salt stress. These features implicate that the assimilatory/dissimilatory roles of ApAlaDH are not only selective for l-alanine and pyruvate, but also, upon salt stress, can catabolize glyoxylate to generate glycine."
"Anti-Angiogenic Activity of Rotenoids from the Stems of Derris trifoliata  Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart. New York.The plants in the genus Derris have proven to be a rich source of rotenoids, of which cytotoxic effect against cancer cells seem to be pronounced. However, their effect on angiogenesis playing a crucial role in both cancer growth and metastasis has been seldom investigated. This study aimed at investigating the effect of the eight rotenoids (1 - 8) isolated from Derris trifoliata stems on three cancer cells and angiogenesis. Among them, 12a-hydroxyrotenone (2) exhibited potent inhibition on both cell growth and migration of HCT116 colon cancer cells. Further, anti-angiogenic assay in an ex vivo model was carried out to determine the effect of the isolated rotenoids on angiogenesis. Results revealed that 12a-hydroxyrotenone (2) displayed the most potent suppression of microvessel sprouting. The in vitro assay on human umbilical vein endothelial cells was performed to determine whether compound 2 elicits anti-angiogenic effect and its effect was found to occur via suppression of endothelial cells proliferation and tube formation, but not endothelial cells migration. This study provides the first evidence that compound 2 could potently inhibit HCT116 cancer migration and anti-angiogenic activity, demonstrating that 2 might be a potential agent or a lead compound for cancer therapy."
"A Self-Microemulsifying Formulation of Oxyresveratrol Prevents Amyloid Beta Protein-Induced Neurodegeneration in Mice  Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart. New York.The polyphenol compound, oxyresveratrol (OXY) possesses potent antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of potential utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, the low oral bioavailability limits its neuroprotective effect and clinical application. The neuroprotective effect of orally administered OXY-loaded self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (OXY-SMEDDS) was compared with free OXY in vivo. Mice were orally administered either free OXY or OXY-SMEDDS once daily at a dose of 90, 180, or 360 mg/kg for 14 d. Mice received a single intracerebroventricular injection of the neurotoxic amyloid β (A β) 25-35 peptide at day 8 during oral treatment. The OXY-SMEDDS formulation resulted in four-times reduction of the free OXY dose required for prevention of neurotoxicity effects due to A β 25-35 peptide as demonstrated by a significant decline in behavior impairments, lipid oxidation levels, and neuronal cell loss in all hippocampal subfields (p < 0.0001). These results indicate the potential of OXY-SMEDDS by oral delivery to improve the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."
"Modified retention and stability criteria for complete denture wearers: A risk assessment tool for impaired masticatory ability and oral health-related quality of life  2017 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: Some complete denture wearers report difficulty with daily activities, especially activities related to denture retention and stability. However, no standard criteria are available for professionally based assessment of complete denture quality. Purpose: The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the association between professionally based assessment of complete denture quality, evaluated by conventional and Chulalongkorn University (CU)-modified Kapur criteria and multiple patient-based outcomes: oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), eating satisfaction, and masticatory performance. The sensitivity and specificity of these criteria in estimating the outcomes were investigated. Material and methods: The participants were 126 individuals with removable acrylic resin complete dentures. Denture retention and stability were scored based on the Kapur method, with excellent intraobserver reliability indicated by a Kappa score of 0.91 to 0.99. The clinical quality of the complete denture was classified according to conventional and CU-modified Kapur criteria. The participants were interviewed for OHRQoL by using the Thai version of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) index and responses were reported as the absence or presence of oral impacts. Participants’ satisfaction eating with their dentures was determined by using a 5-point Likert scale and dichotomized into satisfied and dissatisfied categories. Masticatory performance was evaluated by the multiple sieve method of peanut mastication. After adjusting for covariates, the associations between denture quality and overall and condition-specific (CS) impacts on eating and on eating satisfaction were analyzed by using binary logistic regression, while its association with masticatory performance was determined using linear regression. Goodness-of-fit post estimation was conducted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each denture quality criterion in estimating patient-based outcomes. Results: Complete denture retention and stability, evaluated by conventional and CU-modified Kapur criteria, were associated with multiple patient-based outcomes. However, denture stability showed a stronger association than retention. The CU-modified criteria assessed the quality of maxillary and mandibular dentures individually and revealed a higher sensitivity in estimating all patient-based outcomes. Conclusions: Retention and stability were important indicators in estimating the masticatory ability and OHRQoL of complete denture wearers. The CU-modified Kapur criteria can identify impaired masticatory ability and OHRQoL in complete denture wearers better than conventional criteria."
"The novel toxic free titanium-based amorphous alloy for biomedical application  2018 Brazilian Metallurgical, Materials and Mining Association.Ti based amorphous alloy exhibits excellent properties for biomedical applications. In general, it has high strength, low elastic modulus, good corrosion resistance and satisfactory biocompatibility. This work reported on a systematic study of a novel Ti44Zr10Pd10Cu6Co23Ta7, Ti44Zr10Pd10Cu10Co19Ta7 and Ti44Zr10Pd10Cu14Co15Ta7 metallic glass. Cylindrical rod samples with diameter of 5 mm and 20 mm length were fabricated by induction melting and casting into copper mold. The cast rod was then used as plasma cathode in filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) deposition chamber. The Ti-based metallic glass (MG) thin film was produced and tested for subsequent cell culture investigation to understand the biocompatibility nature of the new alloy. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) was employed to characterize the surface chemistry. The Ti-6Al-4V alloy was studied in parallel as a control material. This novel Ti-based MG composition has shown promising osteoblast biocompatible characteristics and no cytotoxicity on human osteoblast-like cells (SaOS-2). Moreover, cells on Ti-based MG thin film exhibited greater levels of calcium deposition using Alizarin red staining technique to those of the control. All results point out that the novel Ti-based amorphous alloy has potential for using as a new coating for biomedical application and deserve further study."
"Second metals (Lanthanum, Cerium, and Yttrium) modified W/SiO2 catalysts for metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene  2017 Elsevier B.V.Lanthanum, cerium, and yttrium were added as a second metal on the WO3/SiO2 catalysts by the incipient wetness impregnation method with the atomic ratio between the second metal and tungsten 0.083 in order to improve the catalytic performances of W-based catalysts in the metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene. As revealed by various characterization results from X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, ion-exchange titration, FT-Raman, ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and reactant-TPD, the dispersion of tungsten and adsorption properties were significantly improved by adding of the second metals, especially the adsorption of the mixed cis/trans-2-butene isomers. Hence, their catalytic performances were higher than the non-modified one when mixed cis/trans-2 butene isomers were used as the feeds. In addition, the presence of La as the second metal could also reduce coke formation on the catalysts probably by decreasing the ensemble site effect."
"Comparison of catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of ten typical biomass feedstocks to produce aromatics and olefins in a fluidized bed reactor  2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ ProgCatalytic and non-catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP and non-CFP) conversion of the ten biomass species into olefins and aromatics compounds were conducted using a fluidized-bed reactor over HZSM-5 catalyst and sand as bed materials. The influence of biomass type and composition (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) on the yield and selectivity of pyrolysis products was investigated. There was a great difference between CFP and non-CFP products yield. The highest aromatics carbon yield was only 1.34% (corncob) during non-CFP tests. While a remarkable improvement in aromatics carbon yields were 12.12%, 12.52%, and 12.58% obtained from pinewood, corncob, and poplar biomass during CFP tests, respectively. The dominant aromatic compound was benzene with selectivities of 49.6% (bagasse), 46.8% (rice straw), 48.0% (nutshell), and 50.78% (corncob). Moreover, the highest CFP olefins carbon yields were 10.19% (pinewood), 10.69% (corncob), and 9.89% (poplar), compared to highest non-CFP olefins carbon yields were low as 3.37% (bagasse), 2.85% (rice straw), and 2.82% (nutshell). While the higher carbon selectivities toward ethylene were 50.31%, 59.46%, 54.59%, and 51.67% in pinewood, bamboo, indus, and poplar, respectively. The biomass feedstock rich in cellulose and hemicellulose content produce higher hydrocarbon yields than those with higher lignin content. Thus, biomass composition can be used as markers for selecting biomass and predicting pyrolysis products distribution.  2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1371–1379, 2018."
"Production of furan based biofuel with an environmental benign carbon catalyst  2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ ProgA sulfonated carbon material was developed and investigated as an environmentally benign catalyst for furfural production. The sulfonic acid functionality was introduced by sequential hydrothermal carbonization and sulfonation of xylose. The morphology and textural properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy and N2 sorption measurements, respectively. The presence of sulfonic acid on the surface was proven by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Meanwhile, the acid properties were studied using an NH3-TPD profile. Two different sulfonated carbons that was activated with KOH before sulfonation and one that was compared. The KOH-activated sulfonated carbon contained both a porous structure and a high sulfonic acid content that improved the furfural yield and selectivity by more than 50% compared to the nonactivated sulfonated carbon. The reusability of the catalyst was investigated by monitoring the furfural selectivity over several reaction cycles, and after the 3rd cycle, a reduction in the selectivity from 72 to 30% was observed. However, the acid-functionalized carbon could still be useful for furfural production due to its low environmental impact in both the preparation and disposal steps.  2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1455–1461, 2018."
"Cell Death Pathways: a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Neuroscientists  2017, The Author(s).In the first part, the following mechanisms involved in different forms of cell death are considered, with a view to identifying potential therapeutic targets: tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) and their engagement by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α); poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP)-1 cleavage; the apoptosis signalling kinase (ASK)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) axis; lysosomal permeability; activation of programmed necrotic cell death; oxidative stress, caspase-3 inhibition and parthanatos; activation of inflammasomes by reactive oxygen species and the development of pyroptosis; oxidative stress, calcium dyshomeostasis and iron in the development of lysosomal-mediated necrosis and lysosomal membrane permeability; and oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis. In the second part, there is a consideration of the role of lethal and sub-lethal activation of these pathways in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders, with particular reference to the TNF-α-TNFR signalling axis; dysregulation of ASK-1-JNK signalling; prolonged or chronic PARP-1 activation; the role of pyroptosis and chronic inflammasome activation; and the roles of lysosomal permeabilisation, necroptosis and ferroptosis. Finally, it is suggested that, in addition to targeting oxidative stress and inflammatory processes generally, neuropsychiatric disorders may respond to therapeutic targeting of TNF-α, PARP-1, the Nod-like receptor NLRP3 inflammasome and the necrosomal molecular switch receptor-interacting protein kinase-3, since their widespread activation can drive and/or exacerbate peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation even in the absence of cell death. To this end, the use is proposed of a combination of the tetracycline derivative minocycline and N-acetylcysteine as adjunctive treatment for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders."
"Hydrogen effects in TiCl4/MgCl2/THF catalysts with second Lewis acid addition on ethylene polymerization behaviors  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.In this study, four Ziegler–Natta (ZN) catalysts with the absence and presence of Lewis acids including TiCl4/MgCl2/THF (None–THF), TiCl4/ZnCl2/MgCl2/THF (Zn–THF), TiCl4/ZnCl2/AlCl3/MgCl2/THF (ZnAl–THF), and TiCl4/ZnCl2/FeCl2/MgCl2/THF (ZnFe–THF) were synthesized, characterized, and used for ethylene polymerization. This research aims to elucidate the hydrogen effects in different Lewis acid-doped ZN catalysts on ethylene polymerization behaviors in terms of catalytic activity and polymer properties. With the absence of hydrogen during polymerization, it was found that ZnCl2 decreased the catalytic, because it acted as a catalyst poison. The catalytic activity was in the order of None–THF &gt; ZnFe–THF &gt; ZnAl–THF &gt; Zn–THF. Thus, the addition of second Lewis acids such as AlCl3 and FeCl2 was able to improve the catalytic activity of Zn–THF catalyst. In addition, ZnFe–THF catalyst exhibited slightly higher activity than ZnAl–THF catalyst. This is because FeCl2 may better participate in MgCl2 structure due to similar atomic radius, leading to more efficiently removal of the remaining THF in the final catalyst. With the presence of hydrogen during polymerization, the decrease in catalytic activity was in the order of ZnFe–THF &lt; ZnAl–THF &lt; Zn–THF &lt; None–THF with increasing H2/C2H4 molar ratio from 0.08 to 0.60. The hydrogen response on molecular weight was also observed for all catalysts in this study."
"Relationship between PM10 and PM2.5 levels in high-traffic area determined using path analysis and linear regression  2017The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between PM10 and PM2.5 levels as related to meteorological conditions and traffic flow using both a linear regression analysis and a path analysis. The Particulate matter (PM) samples were collected from Sukhumvit road, Bangkok, Thailand, at both open (104 samples) and covered (92 samples) areas along the road. Fifteen percent of all samples were separated before the statistical models were run and used for model validation. The results from the path analysis were more elaborate than those from the linear regression, thus indicating that meteorological conditions had a direct effect on the particulate levels and that the effects of traffic flow were more variable in open areas. The model also indicated that meteorological conditions had an indirect effect and that traffic flow had a direct effect on particulate levels in covered areas. The model validation results indicated that for open areas, the R2 values were not very different between the path analysis and the linear regression model, but that the path analysis was more accurate than the linear regression model at very low PM concentrations. At high PM concentrations, the path analysis model also had a better fit than did the linear regression, so the predictions from the path analysis model were more accurate than those from the linear regression."
"Effect of storage temperature and time on volatile profile of fresh-squeezed Thai lime juice Fresh lime juice is one of the main ingredients in Thai dishes. Thai lime cultivar ‘Pan Rumpai’ (Citrus aurantifolia (Christm&Panz) Swingle) is the most popular for Thai kitchens due to its unique aroma. Thai food services and street food vendors always prepare lime juice earlier in the day for the whole daily usage which leads to changes in lime aroma throughout the day. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of storage temperature and time on volatile profile of lime (‘Pan Rumpai’) juice using solid phase microextraction (SPME)-gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) and chemometrics. In this study, lime juice samples were stored at two storage temperatures (35 and 4°C) and were periodically analyzed at 0 (fresh-squeezed juice, control), 3, and 6 h for 35°C samples and 6, 12, and 24 h for 4°C samples. From SPME-GC/MS, a total of 27 volatiles were found in Thai lime juice. The major volatile compounds in fresh lime juice were limonene, (-)-β-pinene, γ-terpinene, β-bisabolene, and α-bergamotene. The intensity of volatile compounds decreased with storage time, which was more pronounced at 35°C. From chemometric data analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the quantities of volatile compounds of lime samples. From PCA results, samples were separated into 3 groups based on the similarity of samples including fresh-squeezed juice sample; 6- and 12-h stored at 4°C juice samples; 6-h stored at 35°C juice samples; and other lime juice samples. The fresh-squeezed lime juice was quite different from 6-h stored at 35°C samples. β-pinene can be used as a marker for fresh lime juice."
"Enhancing Passive Transport of Micro/Nano Particles into Cells by Oxidized Carbon Black  2018 American Chemical Society.Uses of micro-/nano-sized particles to deliver biologically active entities into cells are common for medical therapeutics and prophylactics and also for cellular experiments. Enhancing cellular uptake and avoiding destruction by lysosomes are desirable for general particulate drug delivery systems. Here, we show that the relatively nontoxic, negatively charged oxidized carbon black particles (OCBs) can enhance cellular penetration of micro- and nano-particles. Experiments with retinal-grafted chitosan particles (PRPs) with hydrodynamic sizes of 1200 ± 51.5, 540 ± 29.0, and 430 ± 11.0 nm (three-sized model particles) indicate that only the sub-micron-sized particles can penetrate the first layer of multilayered liposomes. However, in the presence of OCBs, the micron-sized PRPs and the two submicron-sized PRPs can rapidly enter the interiors of all layers of the multilayered liposomes. Very low cellular uptakes of micro- and submicron-sized PRPs into keratinocytes cells are usually observed. However, in the presence of OCBs, faster and higher cellular uptakes of all of the three-sized PRPs are clearly noticed. Intracellular traffic monitoring of PRP uptake into HepG2 cells in the presence of OCBs revealed that the PRPs did not co-localize with endosomes, suggesting a nonendocytic uptake process. This demonstration of OCB's ability to enhance cellular uptake of micro- and submicron-particles should open up an easy strategy to effectively send various carriers into cells."
"Mechanical and microstructural properties of cement pastes with rice husk ash coated with carbon nanofibers using a natural polymer binder  2018 Elsevier LtdThis study investigated a new approach to dispersion of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) in cement paste by coating rice husk ash (RHA) particles using a natural polymer binder. Light Chitosan with low molecular weight was used to provide bonding between CNFs and SiO2 from the RHA substrate. Mechanical properties namely, compressive strength and flexural properties of paste specimens were assessed to evaluate the efficiency of the applied method. Microstructural analysis was carried out using FTIR, XRD, TGA, and SEM to investigate the effects of the coating process on the hydration products and to explain the mechanical properties of specimens with the modified RHA. The results showed that 15% and 5% modified RHA increased the compressive strength and flexural strength of paste specimens at 28 days by 53% and 187%, respectively. Microstructural analysis showed that the coating process delayed the hydration, however, the physical crosslinking effect of carbon nanofibers enhanced the mechanical properties at all ages."
"Synthesis of mesoporous Tio2 with a template free one step reaction of acid-catalyzed Tic  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Mesoporoustitania (TiO2) having high specific surface areas of 163 to 306 m2/g was prepared by a template-free one step reaction between TiC precursor and aqueous nitric acid (HNO3) solution. The effects of reaction parameters including acid concentration, reaction time and temperature were investigated. The properties of the prepared TiO2 induced by those parameters were characterized by various techniques such as thermal gravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that the TiC was completely oxidized to TiO2 at reaction time of 8 h, 70 °C with 5 M HNO3. At this condition, the obtained TiO2 composed a mixed phase of 45% anatase and 55% rutile and showed the highest pore volume of 0.239 cm3/g with specific surface area of 306 m2/g. Moreover, all the anatase was transformed into the rutile when the reaction time reached 48 h. The rates of the rutile transformation increased with increasing the acid concentrations but decreased with increasing the reaction temperatures. The pore volumes and the specific surface areas were reduced by increasing the acid concentrations or the reaction temperatures. It is possibly because at the conditions of the high acid concentrations or the high temperatures, the mesoporous framework of TiO2 was collapsed. Based on the acid conditions, a peptization process was adopted to describe the effects of all investigated parameters."
"Influences of particle size and content on deformation resistance of crumb rubber modified asphalt using dry process mix  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Crumb Rubber Modified (CRM) is one of techniques for improving asphalt mixture performance. There are two alternatives for applying crumb rubber (CR) to Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA), “Wet” and “Dry”. In the wet process, CR is added into hot asphalt cement in a factory, then CR-asphalt cement infusion is transported to a HMA plant for blending with hot aggregates. In the Dry process, CR is blended with hot aggregates and asphalt cement directly in a HMA plant. Although the dry process is considered less efficient due to lower infusion with asphalt cement, it offers some advantages that CR content can be independently controlled and higher amount of CR can be added into the HMA. This study focuses on dry process that uses CR modification by replacing some aggregate particles in mixture. HMA is blended with CR in 3 different sizes: 1.18-2.36mm, 0.6-1.18mm and smaller than 0.6mm. The x-sized CR is added to the mixture in substitution of the same x-sized aggregate particles at the amount of 1% and 2% by the whole aggregate volume in the mixture. The mixtures’ performance in deformation resistance is represented by Wheel Tracking Slope (WTS). The results of Wheel Tracking tests on the specimens are enlightening. The mixture with CR particles smaller than 0.6mm shows excellent performance on deformation resistance, indicated by significantly lower WTS than others. Secondly, mixtures with higher amounts of CR have better performance than those with lower amounts. The mixture with 2% CR with smaller than 0.6mm provides optimal performance at 2.1 times better than conventional HMA."
"Non-linear site response analysis of soil sites in northern Thailand during the Mw 6.8 tarlay Earthquake  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.On 24 March 2011, the 6.8 Mw Tarlay Earthquake occurred at the border of Thailand and Myanmar. The earthquake not only resulted in structural building damage but also triggered liquefactions on sandy soils in Northern Thailand. Several site investigations including SPT and shear wave velocity measurements are conducted to study subsoils condition in this area. Ground motions at several seismic stations were recorded during the earthquake. In this study, four soil sites in Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai are selected, including a site at the border of Thailand and Myanmar. Next generation attenuation models are employed to generate the input ground motions for each site. Non-linear finite element analysis is employed to observe soil behaviour under the earthquake. The results showed that liquefaction could happen in the investigated area during an earthquake. The result is confirmed by the liquefaction evidence found in Chiang Rai during the 6.8 Mw Tarlay Earthquake. This research can help raise awareness of the impacts of earthquakes to this region."
"Modeling frequency of using informal public transport and public bus: A case study in Phnom Penh, Cambodia  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.For decades, informal transport modes such as Motodup and Remork can be commonly observed in the urban area of Phnom Penh. They play an important role as a major public transport for local travelers, even before the public bus was put into full operation in 2014. This study aims to investigate underlying factors that influence the frequency of using informal transport and public bus by considering traveler’s socioeconomic variables, trip characteristics, and operational characteristics of each transport mode. Utilizing ordered probabilistic modeling, data is analyzed based on 483 samples collected from four main areas in Phnom Penh, i.e., CBD, educational, residential and suburb areas. Results indicate that students do not use Motodup frequently, but they would prefer Remork. Moreover, travel cost is seen to be the major factor that could reduce the likelihood of using Motodup and public bus; however, this variable is not found significant in determining the frequency of using Remork. In terms of commuters’ attitudes, Remork and public bus passengers perceive comfort and availability importantly. The more important they value these two factors, the more frequent they would use such modes. Since the public bus is currently a highly promoted public transport, policy makers should incorporate the quality of comfort and availability, and should keep the bus fare low in order to increase the usage frequency."
"User characteristics and effectiveness of a park and ride facility in Bangkok  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.An experimental project was initiated in Bangkok in 2015 to set up Park and Ride facilities near transit stations as part of an effort to encourage transit use. Incentives were offered to prospective users, including free one-month trial and free transit trips. This paper provides evidence on user characteristics of one of the facilities and its effectiveness in time savings and reducing car travel. After the free-trial period ended, approximately 45% of the users discontinued their use. The results from interview surveys of both continuing and discontinued users confirm time savings and reduction in car travel for a majority of users who had relied solely on cars before the modal shift. But car travel distance increased for users who previously drove to other facilities or used public transport to access transit stations. The radius of the catchment area is found to be 23.6 km. We also developed a logistic regression model of the decision to continue using the facility even after the trial period. The modeling results imply that travel time and driving distance before and after using Park and Ride clearly influence decision-making. Users with longer travel time and driving distance before using Park and Ride tend to continue using the facility."
"Effect of diameter on bond failure of steel rebar embedded into concrete using epoxies at high temperatures  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.A series of pull-out tests were conducted to examine the bond deterioration of epoxy resins at elevated temperatures through the relationship between the critical temperature and bond stress. The steel rebars investigated were deformed bars with varying diameters of 12 mm, 16 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm. Two different types of epoxy resins were used. The test results show that the critical temperature for both types of epoxy resins tends to decrease with the increasing bond stress. In addition, the critical temperature is significantly lower for steel rebar with larger diameters. Meanwhile, the effect from varying types of epoxy resins on the bond characteristics is negligible. In order to illustrate the effect of rebar size, a mechanical model for the adhesive bonding stress between steel rebar and concrete interface at elevated temperatures is presented. The model provides good prediction of the bond stress at failure temperature."

"Substituent effects on furan-phenylene copolymer for photovoltaic improvement: A density functional study  2018 Elsevier B.V.The structural, electronic and photovoltaic properties of furan-phenylene copolymer ((Fu-co-Ph)4) and its derivatives were evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The calculated band gaps of pristine furan and phenylene are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The lower band gap value of 2.72 eV was obtained from –NO2 and –NHCH3 substituents, leading to broader solar absorption range. With respected to the reorganization energy, –OCH3, –NHCH3, –OH, -SCH3, –CH3, –CF3, –NO2, and -F substituted (Fu-co-Ph)4 structures were classified as better electron donor materials. For combination with PC61BM, –NO2, –CN, –CF3 and –F functionalized copolymers demonstrated significantly higher open circuit voltage (Voc) values ranging from 1.07 to 2.10 eV. Our results revealed that electron withdrawing group substitution on furan-phenylene copolymers was an effective way for improving electronic and optical properties of donor materials used in photovoltaic applications."
"Discovery of relation between listeria species and other bacterial contamination by using classification refinement technique  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Cooked chicken meat products are significant to several countries and especially in Thai food processing industry. In the chicken industry tend to detect the genus which affects to human such as pregnant women, unborn or newly delivered infants and the elderly. To prevent germ, the manual testing is the one method to help finding Listeria contamination by using microbiological testing data and analyzing from food scientist. This testing is unable to find the factor or related germ that makes Listeria contamination. Moreover, it has none of computer model apply with Listeria contamination. It just only has another bacterium apply with computer model and it applies with a single classification technique. However, there are a plenty of testing data, that will be superior to use computer model which can predict contamination from those data by apply with classification techniques. Thus, in this paper presents the classification refinement technique including random forest and linear regression to predict Listeria contamination respectively. Also, Naïve Bayes is used to assure the model. This model can indicate the significant related bacteria and the condition of those related bacteria that affect Listeria contamination."
"Fibrous platelet carbon nanofibers-silica fiber composite supports for a Co-based catalyst in the steam reforming of acetic acid  2018 Elsevier B.V.A novel fibrous composite of platelet carbon nanofibers-silica fiber (PCNFs-SF) was synthesized via acetic acid steam reforming (ASR) and then employed as a support for a Co catalyst in the ASR. For comparison, the catalytic behavior of cobalt (Co) catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes-silica fiber (CNTs-SF), silica fiber (SF) and porous silica (Q10) was also studied. The characterization by field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that the PCNFs-SF was like graphite stacked platelets. Both PCNFs-SF and CNTs-SF composite supports enhanced the dispersion of metallic cobalt to achieve smaller Co2O3 particle sizes and strengthen the metal-support interaction. Consequently, the Co/PCNFs-SF and Co/CNTs-SF composite catalysts afforded a higher ASR catalytic activity and selectivity towards hydrogen production than that of the Co/SF and Co/Q10 catalysts. The presence of the carbon nanostructure in the catalyst composites was also found to improve the long-term stability in ASR. The activity of the Co/PCNFs-SF and Co/CNTs-SF composite catalysts remained stable all times during a 12 h stability test. The strong interaction between metal and support together with the unique structure of PCNFs-SF and CNTs-SF composites could effectively suppress deactivation of the catalysts in ASR."
"Mathematical modeling of ascites formation in liver diseases  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Ascites is one of the most common symptoms occurred in patients with some liver diseases such as cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis.This paper presents a mathematical model of the ascitic fluid formation accumulated from blood and insterstitial fluid circulations within the liver with pathology. The liver lobules are treated as porous media in hexagonal shapes connected as a lattice where the flux of ascitic fluid is measured at its border. The influence of size of sinusoids, interstitial space, and fenestrated wall on ascites volume is investigated. Sinusoidal obstruction has the most effect on ascites production compared to the others. Moreover, since each liver disease has different character of pore obstruction, we investigated the effect of location of sinusoidal obstruction on ascites production. The generalized occlusion has more effect on ascites than pericentral and periportal occlusion, respectively, which is correlated to clinical findings in each hepatic disease. The measured flux of ascitic fluid is found linearly related to hepatic wedge pressure (Pw) and free hepatic pressure (Pf). From these results we conclude that increasing of either Pw or Pf can increase production of ascitic fluid."
"Saline irrigation for allergic rhinitis  2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.Background: Allergic rhinitis is a common condition affecting both adults and children. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing and nasal itching, which may affect their quality of life. Nasal irrigation with saline (salty water), also known as nasal douching, washing or lavage, is a procedure that rinses the nasal cavity with isotonic or hypertonic saline solutions. It can be performed with low positive pressure from a spray, pump or squirt bottle, with a nebuliser or with gravity-based pressure in which the person instils saline into one nostril and allows it to drain out of the other. Saline solutions are available over the counter and can be used alone or as an adjunct to other therapies. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of nasal saline irrigation in people with allergic rhinitis. Search methods: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 November 2017. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nasal saline irrigation, delivered by any means and with any volume, tonicity and alkalinity, with (a) no nasal saline irrigation or (b) other pharmacological treatments in adults and children with allergic rhinitis. We included studies comparing nasal saline versus no saline, where all participants also received pharmacological treatment (intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines). Data collection and analysis: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity and a common adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), individual symptom scores, general HRQL, the adverse effects of local irritation or discomfort, ear symptoms (pain or pressure) and nasal endoscopy scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. Main results: We included 14 studies (747 participants). The studies included children (seven studies, 499 participants) and adults (seven studies, 248 participants). No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. Saline volumes ranged from 'very low' to 'high' volume. Where stated, studies used either hypertonic or isotonic saline solution. Nasal saline versus no saline treatment All seven studies (112 adults; 332 children) evaluating this comparison used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we pooled the data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Saline irrigation may improve patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline at up to four weeks (SMD -1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.84 to -0.81; 407 participants; 6 studies; low quality) and between four weeks and three months (SMD -1.44, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.48; 167 participants; 5 studies; low quality). Although the evidence was low quality the SMD values at both time points are considered large effect sizes. Subgroup analysis showed the improvement in both adults and children. Subgroup analyses for volume and tonicity were inconclusive due to heterogeneity. Two studies reported methods for recording adverse effects and five studies mentioned them. Two studies (240 children) reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group and three only reported no adverse effects in the saline group. One study (48 children) reported disease-specific HRQL using a modified RCQ-36 scale. It was uncertain whether there was a difference between the groups at any of the specified time points (very low quality). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Nasal saline versus no saline with adjuvant use of intranasal steroids or oral antihistamines Three studies (40 adults; 79 children) compared saline with intranasal steroids versus intranasal steroids alone; one study (14 adults) compared saline with oral antihistamines versus oral antihistamines alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in patient-reported disease severity at up to four weeks (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.34 to 0.15; 32 participants; 2 studies; very low quality) or from four weeks to three months (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.85 to 0.21; 58 participants; 2 studies; very low quality). Although none of the studies reported methods for recording adverse effects, three mentioned them: one study (40 adults; adjuvant intranasal steroids) reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group; the other two only reported no adverse effects in the saline group. It is uncertain if saline irrigation in addition to pharmacological treatment improved disease-specific HRQL at four weeks to three months, compared with pharmacological treatment alone (SMD -1.26, 95% CI -2.47 to -0.05; 54 participants; 2 studies; very low quality). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Nasal saline versus intranasal steroids It is uncertain if there was a difference in patient-reported disease severity between nasal saline and intranasal steroids at up to four weeks (MD 1.06, 95% CI -1.65 to 3.77; 14 participants; 1 study), or between four weeks and three months (SMD 1.26, 95% CI -0.92 to 3.43; 97 participants; 3 studies), or indisease-specific HRQL between four weeks and three months (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.75; 83 participants; 2 studies). Only one study reported methods for recording adverse effects although three studies mentioned them. One (21 participants) reported two withdrawals due to adverse effects but did not describe these or state which group. Three studies reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) with saline, although one study reported that 27% of participants experienced local discomfort with steroid use. No other secondary outcomes were reported. Authors' conclusions: Saline irrigation may reduce patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline irrigation at up to three months in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis, with no reported adverse effects. No data were available for any outcomes beyond three months. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low. The included studies were generally small and used a range of different outcome measures to report disease severity scores, with unclear validation. This review did not include direct comparisons of saline types (e.g. different volume, tonicity). Since saline irrigation could provide a cheap, safe and acceptable alternative to intranasal steroids and antihistamines further high-quality, adequately powered research in this area is warranted."
"MAGIC biomarkers predict long-term outcomes for steroid-resistant acute GVHD  2018 by The American Society of Hematology.Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is treated with systemic corticosteroid immunosuppression. Clinical response after 1 week of therapy often guides further treatment decisions, but long-term outcomes vary widely among centers, and more accurate predictive tests are urgently needed. We analyzed clinical data and blood samples taken 1 week after systemic treatment of GVHD from 507 patients from 17 centers of the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC), dividing them into a test cohort (n 5 236) and 2 validation cohorts separated in time (n 5 142 and n 5 129). Initial response to systemic steroids correlated with response at 4 weeks, 1-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and overall survival (OS). A previously validated algorithm of 2 MAGIC biomarkers (ST2 and REG3a) consistently separated steroid-resistant patients into 2 groups with dramatically different NRM and OS (P < .001 for all 3 cohorts). High biomarker probability, resistance to steroids, and GVHD severity (Minnesota risk) were all significant predictors of NRM in multivariate analysis. A direct comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the area under the curve for biomarker probability (0.82) was significantly greater than that for steroid response (0.68, P 5 .004) and for Minnesota risk (0.72, P 5 .005). In conclusion, MAGIC biomarker probabilities generated after 1 week of systemic treatment of GVHD predict long-term outcomes in steroid-resistant GVHD better than clinical criteria and should prove useful in developing better treatment strategies.

"Model of social management innovation the empirical case study of Ratchaprasong District in Thailand  2018 IEEE.Due to the constant change of information management system and technology, this article aims to propose a model of social management innovation, which paid attention to the interface between digital technology and CCTV-based data ('The Past'). The Thai public and private sectors have substantially invested in data collection and storage. Yet, there is still an unsystematic and unorganized process of management. The value creation from data analytics has been disconnected from a full participation of all relevant stakeholders. Particularly, CCTV-based data, which acts on behalf of human eyes and minds to monitor and insure safety and security of life and property in city areas, has been left unattended and unutilized. Most investors and governmental authorities have just followed a trend of installing CCTV, rather than fully taking advantage of their investment. By utilizing field work interviews, case study methods and reviews of the literatures, a model of social management innovation in this article indicates three important elements as inputs, throughputs and outputs. The inputs comprise of human activities, times and places. The throughputs require four components including big data, super software, highly qualified computers and artificial intelligence to process the interface between these digital technologies and the past. The outputs are happy societal communities resulting from reduced crime rates, corrective information and an intelligent city."
"Servitization framework for product transition in chemical distribution  2018 IEEE.The main purpose of this paper is to propose a servitization framework of chemical distribution servitization. The framework has adopted theoretical concepts of servitization and focused in an application of markets segmentation, servitization process, and competencies in chemical supply chain. Process of work can be divided into four phases namely customer requirements, SWOT analysis, service combinations, and servitization performance. The final output of this paper is a servitization framework which will be studied further to develop new business model of product service integration business strategy in chemical servitization. Servitization implementation is difficult, even though several literatures mentioned about servitization theories, but the knowledge of how companies can adopt and build up servitization system has remained limited. The significant contribution of this paper is the expansion of previous literatures that many chemical companies can adopt before implementing servitization system in order to escape from risks of business model changing."
"A simulation tool for vertical transportation systems using python  2018 IEEE.This paper presents a software development tool which is capable of simulating the vertical transportation systems within buildings using elevators. The simulation tool is composed of a passenger arrival model for a single or group of elevators, their control system, and a graphical user interface (GUI). The developed GUI can display statistical information of the passengers traffic pattern and also the animation of elevator cars with the number of passengers inside. The current version allows both individual and batch Poisson arrival processes which could represent up-peak traffic in the morning and after lunch of office buildings respectively. The motion of elevator cars has been precisely modeled with real parameters of velocity, acceleration, distance, and jerk. However, only the basic nearest car algorithm is implemented for elevator group control systems. We believe, the developed simulator not only has its utility for educational purpose but also can serve as a software platform for future research on more advanced elevator group control systems."
"PCR-GLOBWB 2: A 5 arcmin global hydrological and water resources model  Author(s) 2018.We present PCR-GLOBWB 2, a global hydrology and water resources model. Compared to previous versions of PCR-GLOBWB, this version fully integrates water use. Sector-specific water demand, groundwater and surface water withdrawal, water consumption, and return flows are dynamically calculated at every time step and interact directly with the simulated hydrology. PCR-GLOBWB 2 has been fully rewritten in Python and PCRaster Python and has a modular structure, allowing easier replacement, maintenance, and development of model components. PCR-GLOBWB 2 has been implemented at 5 arcmin resolution, but a version parameterized at 30 arcmin resolution is also available. Both versions are available as open-source codes on https://github.com/UU-Hydro/PCR-GLOBWB-model (Sutanudjaja et al., 2017a). PCR-GLOBWB 2 has its own routines for groundwater dynamics and surface water routing. These relatively simple routines can alternatively be replaced by dynamically coupling PCR-GLOBWB 2 to a global two-layer groundwater model and 1-D-2-D hydrodynamic models. Here, we describe the main components of the model, compare results of the 30 and 5 arcmin versions, and evaluate their model performance using Global Runoff Data Centre discharge data. Results show that model performance of the 5 arcmin version is notably better than that of the 30 arcmin version. Furthermore, we compare simulated time series of total water storage (TWS) of the 5 arcmin model with those observed with GRACE, showing similar negative trends in areas of prevalent groundwater depletion. Also, we find that simulated total water withdrawal matches reasonably well with reported water withdrawal from AQUASTAT, while water withdrawal by source and sector provide mixed results."
"Screen-Printed Electroluminescent Lamp Modified with Graphene Oxide as a Sensing Device Copyright  2018 American Chemical Society.A screen-printed electroluminescent display with different sensing capabilities is presented. The sensing principle is based on the direct relationship between the light intensity of the lamp and the conductivity of the external layers. The proposed device is able to detect the ionic concentration of any conductive species. Using both top and bottom emission architectures, for the first time, a humidity sensor based on electroluminescent display functionalized by a graphene oxide nanocomposite is introduced. In this regard, just by coupling the display to a smartphone camera sensor, its potential was expanded for automatically monitoring human respiration in real time. Besides, the research includes a responsive display in which the light is spatially turned on in response to pencil drawing or any other conductive media. The above mentioned features together with the easiness of manufacturing and cost-effectiveness of this electroluminescent display can open up great opportunities to exploit it in sensing applications and point-of-care diagnosis."
"Climate in Sundaland and Asian monsoon variability during the last deglaciation  2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUAThe lack of semi-quantitative paleo data from mainland Southeast Asia, especially from the emergent Sundaland, creates a marked difficulty in following the past Asian monsoon variability. The published pollen records from the adjacent sites to the Sundaland were selected in this study and evaluated for the relationship between taxa and plant functional types (PFTs), and subsequently between PFTs and biome, to eventually reconstruct the semi-quantitative temporal temperature and precipitation profile. In order to comprehend the Asian monsoon modification between 18.5 and 11 ka BP, the derived pollen based temperature and precipitation records were further analyzed together with other selected speleothem records from the Asian monsoon region, with reference to the Greenland and Antarctic ice cores. The warmer temperature in the Southern Hemisphere caused a southward shift of the mean position of the Intertropical Convergent Zone (ITCZ) and weakened the summer monsoon in the Asian monsoon region between 18.5 and 15 ka BP. The Northern Hemisphere temperature played an important role in the Asian monsoon modification between 15 and 13.5 ka BP, where the warmer Northern Hemisphere conditions strengthened the summer monsoon intensity in the Asian monsoon region and moved the mean position of the ITCZ to the north. However, the opposing precipitation pattern between the East and the West Indian Ocean suggested the potential influence of the Walker circulation on the Sundaland climate from 13.5 to 11 ka BP."
"Empirical Stress Intensity Factor Equations for Cracked Steel Plates Repaired with Double-Sided FRP Patches  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper presents an approach that combines the finite element (FE) modeling and genetic programming (GP) to provide accurate empirical stress intensity factor (SIF) equations for center-cracked steel plates repaired with adhesive-bonded double-sided fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) patches. Several past studies in recent years independently showed that the reduction on the SIF of cracked structures after the patch repair is dependent on many factors such as bonding techniques, material parameters, geometric parameters, environmental factors. In this study, the SIF of the repaired cracked steel plate was considered to be a function of seven parameters including the crack length, elastic modulus of FRP material, shear modulus of adhesive material, dimensions (width, length, and thickness) of rectangular FRP patches, and thickness of adhesive layers. Empirical SIF equations were created by the data mining process of genetic programming analyses performed on a database created from the FE results. The SIF values obtained from these equations were also compared with an analytical equation to assess whether their ability to perform well on a certain design or not. It was found that the proposed SIF equations fitted well with the FE results as the squared Pearson correlation coefficients R2 are higher than 0.9. In addition, the correlations between proposed equations and the analytical equation are approximately 0.8."
"Performance of the CMS muon detector and muon reconstruction with proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV  2018 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration..The CMS muon detector system, muon reconstruction software, and high-level trigger underwent significant changes in 2013-2014 in preparation for running at higher LHC collision energy and instantaneous luminosity. The performance of the modified system is studied using proton-proton collision data at center-of-mass energy s=13 TeV, collected at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The measured performance parameters, including spatial resolution, efficiency, and timing, are found to meet all design specifications and are well reproduced by simulation. Despite the more challenging running conditions, the modified muon system is found to perform as well as, and in many aspects better than, previously. We dedicate this paper to the memory of Prof. Alberto Benvenuti, whose work was fundamental for the CMS muon detector."
"Very late presentation of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: Case report  2018 The Author(s).Background: Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital coronary anomaly. The enlarged right coronary artery provides retrograde collaterals to supply the left ventricle then preferentially directs into the lower pressure pulmonary artery system causing coronary steal phenomenon. Few patients who survive through adulthood without surgery must have abundant, well-formed functioning collaterals with adequate perfusion of the left ventricle. We present the oldest reported patient with ALCAPA to undergo corrective surgery. Case presentation: A 79-year-old woman presented with a 3-months history of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination discovered a soft continuous murmur at the left upper chest. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent flow from color Doppler. Moreover, there was a severe mitral regurgitation from posterior mitral leaflet restriction associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation. Coronary angiography and coronary computed tomography angiography established the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome. Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated no myocardial ischemia suggesting adequate collateral circulation. Remarkably, there was a left coronary ostial stenosis, which served as a protective mechanism against myocardia ischemia by limiting the steal effect. The patient successfully underwent the ligation of anomalous artery at its origin in combination with bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusions: This case utilized multimodality imaging for delineating the course of abnormal vessels and helping to formulate therapeutic decision."
"Leishmania (Mundinia) orientalis n. sp. (Trypanosomatidae), a parasite from Thailand responsible for localised cutaneous leishmaniasis  2018 The Author(s).Background: Leishmaniasis is an emerging disease in Thailand with an unknown incidence or prevalence. Although the number of properly characterized and clinically confirmed cases is about 20, it is suspected that this low number masks a potentially high prevalence, with clinical disease typically manifesting itself against an immunocompromised background, but with a substantial number of subclinical or cured cases of infection. To date leishmaniasis in Thailand has been mainly ascribed to two taxa within the recently erected subgenus Mundinia Shaw, Camargo & Teixeira, 2016, Leishmania (Mundinia) martiniquensis Desbois, Pratlong & Dedet, 2014 and a species that has not been formally described prior to this study. Results: A case of simple cutaneous leishmaniasis was diagnosed in a patient from Nan Province, Thailand. Molecular analysis of parasites derived from a biopsy sample revealed this to be a new species of Leishmania Ross, 1908, which has been named as Leishmania (Mundinia) orientalis Bates & Jariyapan n. sp. A formal description is provided, and this new taxon supercedes some isolates from the invalid taxon ""Leishmania siamensis"". A summary of all known cases of leishmaniasis with a corrected species identification is provided. Conclusions: Three species of parasites are now known to cause leishmaniasis is Thailand, L. martiniquensis and L. orientalis n. sp. in the subgenus Mundinia, which contains the type-species Leishmania enriettii Muniz & Medina, 1948, and a single case of Leishmania infantum Nicolle, 1908. This study now enables epidemiological and other investigations into the biology of these unusual parasites to be conducted. It is recommended that the use of the taxonomically invalid name ""L. siamensis"" should be discontinued."
"Formation of crystallites with low surface energy- A key to understand the crystallization of oriented polymer  2018 The Society of Fiber Science and Technology, Japan.In order to demonstrate that lower surface energies of bundle-like crystals have a dominant effect for the enhancement of strain-induced crystallization of natural rubber (NR), an estimation of the end-surface energy (σe) was attempted. NR samples were quickly stretched at predetermined crystallization temperature (Tc) to a prescribed draw ratio (αs), and the wide angle X-ray diffraction patterns during the subsequent stepwise heating process were investigated. Melting temperature (Tm) was found to depend solely on αs and to be independent of Tc. Simultaneously, average crystallite size in the chain direction (<Lc>) was primarily determined by network-chain density and was also independent of Tc. As a result, the plot of Tm versus <Lc>-1 suggested that σe is negligibly low and estimated Tm is an approximation of the equilibrium melting temperature."
"Measurement of differential cross sections for the production of top quark pairs and of additional jets in lepton + jets events from p p collisions at s = 13 TeV  2018 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.Differential and double-differential cross sections for the production of top quark pairs in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV are measured as a function of kinematic variables of the top quarks and the top quark-antiquark (tt) system. In addition, kinematic variables and multiplicities of jets associated with the tt production are measured. This analysis is based on data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb-1. The measurements are performed in the lepton+jets decay channels with a single muon or electron and jets in the final state. The differential cross sections are presented at the particle level, within a phase space close to the experimental acceptance, and at the parton level in the full phase space. The results are compared to several standard model predictions that use different methods and approximations. The kinematic variables of the top quarks and the tt system are reasonably described in general, though none predict all the measured distributions. In particular, the transverse momentum distribution of the top quarks is more steeply falling than predicted. The kinematic distributions and multiplicities of jets are adequately modeled by certain combinations of next-to-leading-order calculations and parton shower models."
"The differences of individual spatial strategy on their solving performance  2018 IEEE.Spatial ability has numerous definitions such as the ability to perceive and perform manipulation on perception accurately. While majority of researches in this area have been focusing on the development of the training materials despite a concern of human factor as their cognitive strategy for solving spatial problems. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the differences of individual spatial strategy on their spatial solving performance. Two-hundred-eighty-seven first-year Thai engineering student participated in this study. The results revealed the validity of individual spatial strategy and showed that people with analytic spatial strategy had the significantly lower performance in spatial solving than those with holistic and intermediate strategy. This study has the implication on the training process and materials that suit with the thought process of people to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the training. Discussion and future work were provided."
"Loss time reduction for improve Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)  2018 IEEE.A Tobacco industry was facing some problem due to breakdowns, equipment defects and poor working condition. During August 2016 to July 2017. The average OEE is 66%. The OEE performance indicator focusing on Availability rate is 89%, Performance rate is 75% and Quality rate is 99%. This is due to the lack of performance rate and this number is declining. The purpose of this paper is to reduce loss time in Tobacco industry and improve performance rate as well as to enhance the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) through the implementation of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and RCM (Reliability Centered Maintenance) by using Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). After implementation, the performance rate has increased from 75% to 79% which also enhance OEE from 66% to 72%."
"Innovative product development of fabric glass interlayer  2018 IEEE.A glass manufacturer in Thailand developed the laminated fabric glass as innovative product in 2013 but sales had declined in 2016. Customer's survey shows that the satisfaction level decreased due to long production lead time, high-selling price and long installation time. This paper aims to develop a new innovative fabric glass interlayer product by adopting 5D innovation development process. 5D consists of Discover, Define, Design, Develop and Deploy. Firstly, discover phase adopted Five Forces Analysis, Customer Behavior Analysis and Customers Satisfaction Survey for specifying market position and seeking the hidden customers' expectations. Define is to summarize the project charter as initiation step in the project management and to scope resources and timeframe. Design, we adopted the integration of QFD, Kano Model and Product Quality Index for prioritizing and translating customer expectations to product specifications. Then all concepts were concluded by Pugh Matrix, Weighted Sum Score and confirmed the selected concept by financial feasibility study. Develop process is to prototyping to verify the production before scale up. Finally, generated the risk assessment plan by FMEA and contributed the business plan to ensure the effective commercialization in Deploy. The developed fabric glass interlayer shows higher customer satisfaction level by shorten production lead time from 14 days to 8 days (42.85%), lower price from 790 baht/ft2 to 485 baht/ft2(38.61%) and shorten installation time from 180 minutes to 45 minutes (75%)."
"Topological evolution of public transportation network: A case study of Bangkok rail transit network  2018 IEEE.Bangkok Rail Transit Network (BRTN) is the first urban rail transit system in Thailand, initially operated in 1999. Once completed in 2029, the BRTN will be one of the world largest urban rail transit networks, with 285 stations accounting for 508 kilometers of travel distance. To investigate and explain the topological evolution of BRTN from 1999 to 2029, five network indicators were selected, including network diameter, gamma index, degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. We found that, as the BRTN evolves, both diameter and gamma index seemingly rise indicating better spread and connectivity over time. Likewise, average degree centrality increases from 1.91 to 2.27, while both average closeness and betweenness centrality gradually decline; but with different intensity patterns. More specifically, stations with high closeness tend to be those in the central Bangkok area as they conveniently reach the rest of the network with fewer links; however, as betweenness gives more weights to stations that facilitate transportation, stations with high betweenness tend to be those joining central area to the suburbs."
"AbDesigner3D: A structure-guided tool for peptide-based antibody production  Published by Oxford University Press 2018.

"Technical and economic assessment of the pyrolysis and gasification integrated process for biomass conversion  2018 Elsevier LtdThe technical and economic prospects for synthesis gas production via an integrated biomass pyrolysis and gasification (IBPG) process are evaluated for the case where rice straw is a considered feedstock. Modeling of the integrated process is performed by using the Aspen Custom Modeler program. The simulation results show that the production rates of synthesis gas and bio-oil derived from an IBPG process increase as pyrolysis temperature increases, due to the increased volatiles. Compared to a conventional biomass gasification, IBPG provides additional bio-oil as a valued by-product, releases less waste heat and offers higher energy efficiency at the same synthesis gas production rate. The IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C shows the best technical performance. However, pinch analysis indicates that the IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C or 500 °C and conventional biomass gasification is technically feasible; the optimum heat integration structures are achieved. The economic analysis, which considers only the reaction-related equipment, indicates that the IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C offers synthesis gas and bio-oil production rates of 1.185 and 0.2044 kmol h−1, respectively, and an energy efficiency of 68.86% is most economically feasible."
"Neurturin Gene Therapy Protects Parasympathetic Function to Prevent Irradiation-Induced Murine Salivary Gland Hypofunction  2018Head and neck cancer patients treated with irradiation often present irreversible salivary gland hypofunction for which no conventional treatment exists. We recently showed that recombinant neurturin, a neurotrophic factor, improves epithelial regeneration of mouse salivary glands in ex vivo culture after irradiation by reducing apoptosis of parasympathetic neurons. Parasympathetic innervation is essential to maintain progenitor cells during gland development and for regeneration of adult glands. Here, we investigated whether a neurturin-expressing adenovirus could be used for gene therapy in vivo to protect parasympathetic neurons and prevent gland hypofunction after irradiation. First, ex vivo fetal salivary gland culture was used to compare the neurturin adenovirus with recombinant neurturin, showing they both improve growth after irradiation by reducing neuronal apoptosis and increasing innervation. Then, the neurturin adenovirus was delivered to mouse salivary glands in vivo, 24 hr before irradiation, and compared with a control adenovirus. The control-treated glands have ∼50% reduction in salivary flow 60 days post-irradiation, whereas neurturin-treated glands have similar flow to nonirradiated glands. Further, markers of parasympathetic function, including vesicular acetylcholine transporter, decreased with irradiation, but not with neurturin treatment. Our findings suggest that in vivo neurturin gene therapy prior to irradiation protects parasympathetic function and prevents irradiation-induced hypofunction."
"Facile synthesis of graphene-AgVO3 nanocomposite with excellent supercapacitor performance  2018 Elsevier B.V.The graphene-AgVO3 nanocomposites (GA30) were synthesized by facile one-step chemical-bath method. SEM and TEM images of the synthesized nanocomposites indicate that this method is possible to anchor the AgVO3 nanoparticles onto the graphene surface. Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) shows that specific capacitance, cycle stability, and rate capability of the supercapacitor device can be enhanced with AgVO3 incorporation. The GA30 shows a high energy density of 10 Wh/kg at a power density of 25 W/kg as well as a high power density of 2045 W/kg at an energy density of 6 Wh/kg, which are much higher than those of graphene/activated carbon composites (GC30) and previous reported graphene-based composites. The improvement in specific capacitance, cycle stability, energy density and powder density of the graphene would be attributed to the special microstructure with high-rate transportation of both electrolyte ions and electrons due to the incorporation of AgVO3."
"The combined magnetic field and iron oxide-PLGA composite particles: Effective protein antigen delivery and immune stimulation in dendritic cells  2018 Elsevier Inc.Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have received much attention in drug and biomolecule delivery systems. Here, we report a delivery system using the combination of a magnetic field and the relatively biocompatible composite particles of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and SPIONs (SPION-PLGA particles) for protein delivery to bone-marrow derived primary dendritic cells (BM-DCs). SPIONs with the diameter of ∼10 nm were synthesized via thermal decomposition of iron(III) oleate. The SPIONs and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were encapsulated in PLGA particles of two different diameters, 300 and 500 nm. The obtained SPIONs-PLGA nanocomposites exhibited superparamagnetic character, showed low cytotoxicity and were well taken up in macrophage and BM-DCs under an external magnetic field. In addition, the nanocomposites were tested for immune induction in BM-DCs. This combined SPION-PLGA carrier and an external magnetic field can significantly enhance BM-DC maturation by upregulating MHC II, CD80 and CD86 expression. Immune response induction by this strategy is verified through a significant upregulation of the IL-12 and IFN-γ production. Moreover, no activation of BM-DCs to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α was observed for all particles. We anticipate these findings to be a starting point for vaccine researches involving the combined magnetic field and SPION-PLGA composite particles."
"Fabrication and evaluation of nanocellulose sponge for oil/water separation  2018 Elsevier LtdNanocellulose sponge was fabricated by a facile method: freeze-drying of nanocellulose aqueous suspension to sponge state, following by hydrophobic treatment with stearoyl chloride at 50 °C for 1 h. The obtained nanocellulose sponge showed superhydrophobicity (160° of water contact angle) and superoleophilicity with high protection from water but selective absorption of oil. Its absorption capacities for various kinds of oil and non-polar liquids were 25–55 times higher than its dry weight and exhibited excellent selectivity for absorbing of oil which spilled on the surface of water or underwater with high separation efficiency. This superhydrophobic nanocellulose sponge can be easily recovered by simple squeezing and reused at least 10 cycles with remained high separation efficiency. It is expected that such a biodegradable nanocellulose sponge can be applied to solve the oil spill accident and treat the oily wastewater from households and industries."
"Updating the recommendations for treatment of tardive syndromes: A systematic review of new evidence and practical treatment algorithm  2018 Elsevier B.V.Background: Management of tardive syndromes (TS) is challenging, with only a few evidence-based therapeutic algorithms reported in the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guideline in 2013. Objective: To update the evidence-based recommendations and provide a practical treatment algorithm for management of TS by addressing 5 questions: 1) Is withdrawal of dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) an effective TS treatment? 2) Does switching from typical to atypical DRBAs reduce TS symptoms? 3) What is the efficacy of pharmacologic agents in treating TS? 4) Do patients with TS benefit from chemodenervation with botulinum toxin? 5) Do patients with TS benefit from surgical therapy? Methods: Systematic reviews were conducted by searching PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane for articles published between 2012 and 2017 to identify new evidence published after the 2013 AAN guidelines. Articles were classified according to an AAN 4-tiered evidence-rating scheme. To the extent possible, for each study we attempted to categorize results based on the description of the population enrolled (tardive dyskinesia [TD], tardive dystonia, tardive tremor, etc.). Recommendations were based on the evidence. Results and recommendations: New evidence was combined with the existing guideline evidence to inform our recommendations. Deutetrabenazine and valbenazine are established as effective treatments of TD (Level A) and must be recommended as treatment. Clonazepam and Ginkgo biloba probably improve TD (Level B) and should be considered as treatment. Amantadine and tetrabenazine might be considered as TD treatment (Level C). Pallidal deep brain stimulation possibly improves TD and might be considered as a treatment for intractable TD (Level C). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute TS treatment by withdrawing causative agents or switching from typical to atypical DRBA (Level U)."
"Integrating the social, hydrological and ecological dimensions of freshwater health: The Freshwater Health Index  2018 The AuthorsDegradation of freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide is a primary cause of increasing water insecurity, raising the need for integrated solutions to freshwater management. While methods for characterizing the multi-faceted challenges of managing freshwater ecosystems abound, they tend to emphasize either social or ecological dimensions and fall short of being truly integrative. This paper suggests that management for sustainability of freshwater systems needs to consider the linkages between human water uses, freshwater ecosystems and governance. We present a conceptualization of freshwater resources as part of an integrated social-ecological system and propose a set of corresponding indicators to monitor freshwater ecosystem health and to highlight priorities for management. We demonstrate an application of this new framework —the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) — in the Dongjiang River Basin in southern China, where stakeholders are addressing multiple and conflicting freshwater demands. By combining empirical and modeled datasets with surveys to gauge stakeholders' preferences and elicit expert information about governance mechanisms, the FHI helps stakeholders understand the status of freshwater ecosystems in their basin, how ecosystems are being manipulated to enhance or decrease water-related services, and how well the existing water resource management regime is equipped to govern these dynamics over time. This framework helps to operationalize a truly integrated approach to water resource management by recognizing the interplay between governance, stakeholders, freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide."
"Bose-Einstein correlations in pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions at sNN =0.9-7 TeV BOSE-EINSTEIN CORRELATIONS in pp, pPb, ⋯ A. M. SIRUNYAN et al.  2018 CERN.Quantum-statistical (Bose-Einstein) two-particle correlations are measured in pp collisions at s=0.9, 2.76, and 7 TeV, as well as in pPb and peripheral PbPb collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies of 5.02 and 2.76 TeV, respectively, using the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Separate analyses are performed for same-sign unidentified charged particles as well as for same-sign pions and kaons identified via their energy loss in the silicon tracker. The characteristics of the one-, two-, and three-dimensional correlation functions are studied as functions of the pair average transverse momentum (kT) and the charged-particle multiplicity in the event. For all systems, the extracted correlation radii steadily increase with the event multiplicity, and decrease with increasing kT. The radii are in the range 1-5 fm, the largest values corresponding to very high multiplicity pPb interactions and to peripheral PbPb collisions with multiplicities similar to those seen in pPb data. It is also observed that the dependencies of the radii on multiplicity and kT largely factorize. At the same multiplicity, the radii are relatively independent of the colliding system and center-of-mass energy."
"Quercitol: From a Taxonomic Marker of the Genus Quercus to a Versatile Chiral Building Block of Antidiabetic Agents  2018 American Chemical Society.Quercitol is a cyclohexanepentol that has been recognized as a biomarker of plants in genus Quercus, which includes oak.

Our continuing investigations on the synthesis of antidiabetic agents from quercitol have demonstrated that this chiral synthon can generate diverse structural features with improved hypoglycemic activity."
"Evaluation of chromatographic separation of free lutein and fatty acids in de-esterified marigold lutein  2018 Taylor & Francis.In this study, chromatographic purification of de-esterified marigold lutein was evaluated to obtain high purity free lutein. The quantification and identification of fatty acid in the de-esterified marigold lutein, which have not been reported before, were determined. The amount of fatty acid, mostly palmitic acid, was 49.12 mg/g oleoresin. The separation of free lutein and fatty acid was then performed. The high purity and recovery of free lutein were observed to be 99.2% and 95.2%, respectively, for the suitable chromatographic separation condition, i.e., step-gradient of hexane-ethyl acetate mixture at 85:15 v/v in the first 12 min, followed by 70:30 v/v."
"Anticancer activity of arborinine from Glycosmis parva leaf extract in human cervical cancer cells  2018 Elsevier Inc.Glycosmis parva is a small shrub found in Thailand. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract from its leaves has been shown to exert anticancer effects in vitro; however, the compound responsible for this activity has not been isolated and characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that arborinine, a major acridone alkaloid in the EtOAc fraction, decreased proliferation and was strongly cytotoxic to HeLa cervical cancer cells without significantly affecting normal cells. The compound also inhibited tumor spheroid growth much more potently than chemotherapeutic drugs bleomycin, gemcitabine, and cisplatin. In addition, unlike cisplatin, arborinine activated caspase-dependent apoptosis without inducing DNA damage response. We further show that arborinine strongly suppressed cancer cell migration by downregulating expression of key regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Taken together, our data provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of arborinine's anticancer activity, supporting its potential use for treating cervical cancer."
"Search for Physics beyond the Standard Model in Events with High-Momentum Higgs Bosons and Missing Transverse Momentum in Proton-Proton Collisions at 13 TeV  2018 CERN.A search for physics beyond the standard model in events with one or more high-momentum Higgs bosons, H, decaying to pairs of b quarks in association with missing transverse momentum is presented. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1, were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy s=13 TeV. The analysis utilizes a new b quark tagging technique based on jet substructure to identify jets from H→bb. Events are categorized by the multiplicity of H-tagged jets, jet mass, and the missing transverse momentum. No significant deviation from standard model expectations is observed. In the context of supersymmetry (SUSY), limits on the cross sections of pair-produced gluinos are set, assuming that gluinos decay to quark pairs, H (or Z), and the lightest SUSY particle, LSP, through an intermediate next-to-lightest SUSY particle, NLSP. With large mass splitting between the NLSP and LSP, and 100% NLSP branching fraction to H, the lower limit on the gluino mass is found to be 2010 GeV."
"Measurement of angular parameters from the decay B0 → K⁎0μ+μ− in proton–proton collisions at s=8TeV  2018 The Author(s)Angular distributions of the decay B0→K⁎0μ+μ− are studied using a sample of proton–proton collisions at s=8TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.5fb−1. An angular analysis is performed to determine the P1 and P5 ′ parameters, where the P5 ′ parameter is of particular interest because of recent measurements that indicate a potential discrepancy with the standard model predictions. Based on a sample of 1397 signal events, the P1 and P5 ′ parameters are determined as a function of the dimuon invariant mass squared. The measurements are in agreement with predictions based on the standard model."
"Search for single production of a vector-like T quark decaying to a Z boson and a top quark in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The Author(s)A search is presented for single production of a vector-like quark (T) decaying to a Z boson and a top quark, with the Z boson decaying leptonically and the top quark decaying hadronically. The search uses data collected by the CMS experiment in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1. The presence of forward jets is a particular characteristic of single production of vector-like quarks that is used in the analysis. For the first time, different T quark width hypotheses are studied, from negligibly small to 30% of the new particle mass. At the 95% confidence level, the product of cross section and branching fraction is excluded above values in the range 0.26–0.04 pb for T quark masses in the range 0.7–1.7 TeV, assuming a negligible width. A similar sensitivity is observed for widths of up to 30% of the T quark mass. The production of a heavy Z′ boson decaying to Tt, with T→tZ, is also searched for, and limits on the product of cross section and branching fractions for this process are set between 0.13 and 0.06 pb for Z′ boson masses in the range from 1.5 to 2.5 TeV."
"Search for excited quarks of light and heavy flavor in γ + jet final states in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The Author(s)A search is presented for excited quarks of light and heavy flavor that decay to γ+jet final states. The analysis is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1 collected by the CMS experiment in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV at the LHC. A signal would appear as a resonant contribution to the invariant mass spectrum of the γ+jet system, above the background expected from standard model processes. No resonant excess is found, and upper limits are set on the product of the excited quark cross section and its branching fraction as a function of its mass. These are the most stringent limits to date in the γ+jet final state, and exclude excited light quarks with masses below 5.5 TeV and excited b quarks with masses below 1.8 TeV, assuming standard model like coupling strengths."
"Search for a massive resonance decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons in the four b quark final state in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The Author(s)A search for a massive resonance decaying into a pair of standard model Higgs bosons, in a final state consisting of two b quark–antiquark pairs, is performed. A data sample of proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used, collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1. The Higgs bosons are highly Lorentz-boosted and are each reconstructed as a single large-area jet. The signal is characterized by a peak in the dijet invariant mass distribution, above a background from the standard model multijet production. The observations are consistent with the background expectations, and are interpreted as upper limits on the products of the s-channel production cross sections and branching fractions of narrow bulk gravitons and radions in warped extra-dimensional models. The limits range from 126 to 1.4 fb at 95% confidence level for resonances with masses between 750 and 3000 GeV, and are the most stringent to date, over the explored mass range."
"Lower bound limit analysis of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion using second-order cone programming Copyright  2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.In this paper, the formulation of the lower bound limit analysis of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion using second-order cone programming is described. The finite element concept was used to discretize the soil mass into 3-noded triangular elements. The stress field was modeled using a linear interpolation within the elements while stress discontinuities were permitted to occur at the shared edges of adjacent elements. An elliptical yield criterion was adopted to model the anisotropic undrained strength of the clay. A statically admissible stress field was defined by enforcing the equilibrium equations within all triangular elements and along all shared edges of adjacent elements, stress boundary conditions, and no stress violation of the anisotropic strength envelope cast in the form of a conic quadratic constraint. The lower bound solution of the proposed formulation was solved by second-order cone programming. The proposed formulation of the anisotropic undrained strength criterion was validated through comparison of the model's predictions with the known exact solutions of strip footings, and was applied to solve undrained stability of a shallow unlined square tunnel. Computational performance between the proposed approach of second-order cone programming and linear programming was examined and discussed."
"PV and battery sizing for user's defined energy independence  2017 IEEE.This paper proposes a method to determine an optimal size of PV, with and without battery, based on the minimum life cycle cost (LCC), in compliance with the user's specified energy self-supplied index (ESSI). The output graphical information is provided to enhance customer's choice in selecting the lowest LCC of PV and battery which satisfies the user's desired ESSI and budget allowance. Test results reveal that LCC of the PV with battery is always less than that of the PV without battery when ESSI is set above 45%.

In the current TARS, they give a high importance to the data that is nearby time to the current time or nearby time to the target user data but did not consider preference change, or concept driven, of the target user. Therefore, the result of the current TARS may not good enough. This paper proposes the TARS that can detect the individual preference driven by using FCM algorithm and entropy to find the preference change in the rating timeline. Then, we select the period in the past of the target user that has a similar preference to the current preference period to find the neighbors and predict the target item's rating. The proposed method does not necessary use the entire user data in the past but uses only the data in the past period of the target user that is similar to the current period for prediction. In the experiment, the proposed method is compared with the two current TARS methods on MovieLens dataset. The evaluation results can be confirmed that the proposed method provides more accuracy and coverage than the two current methods. Moreover, the proposed method uses smaller data than the other two methods. Thus, this makes the calculation time faster."
"What Graphs do International Investors See in the ASEAN Capital Markets?  2018 IEEE.To remain successful in a world of proliferating business graphs, international investors and other users must be aware of possible graphical misrepresentations. Naïve investors can be easily misled by distorted business graphs and make investments on the basis of their ostensibly computer-generated data. This study examines the relationship between graph distortion measures and firms' financial performance. We manually collected publicly available data from 2015 for 370 companies, across three industry sectors, trading on the stock exchanges of six ASEAN countries - Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. After several rounds of filtering, 3,897 usable graphs were measured for distortion using the relative graph discrepancy index (RGD). The results show that the graphs produced by fast-growing, developing markets, such as the Philippines and Thailand, have high average distortion scores, whereas those produced by mature markets, such as Singapore, have low graph distortion scores. However, the relationship between graph distortion scores and firm performance is inconclusive. Findings from the archival data were triangulated with perceptual data collected through an online survey of 38 MBA students. The archival data appear to indicate a negative relationship, whereas the perceptual data suggest a positive one."
Relevant factors and classification of student alcohol consumption  2018 IEEE.Educational data mining is the process of applying data mining tools and techniques to analyze data for educational purpose. This paper carries out educational data mining to study the student alcohol consumption through a public dataset which includes student attributes and their grades. The decision tree algorithm and the random forest algorithm are applied to perform classification and to analyze the variable importance. The regression model is then employed to illustrate the relationship between alcohol consumption level and the students' final grades. Our analysis provides knowledge on the relationship between student characteristics and alcohol consumption. The study also compares performance of the decision tree algorithm and the random forest algorithm.
"Extraordinary Enhancement of UV Absorption in TiO2 Nanoparticles Enabled by Low-Oxidized Graphene Nanodots  2018 American Chemical Society.Titanium oxide (TiO2) exhibits intrinsically strong absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light, which has been utilized in a variety of applications, such as environmental purification/sterilization, health care, and energies. Accordingly, it is greatly demanded to precisely tune and further improve the UV absorption of TiO2 to significantly broaden its versatility. Herein, we report an extraordinary enhancement of UV absorption in TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated with graphene nanodots (GNDs) of low oxygen concentration. Chemically bonded TiO2 NP/GND composites exhibit highly tunable UV absorption, achieving over 243% enhancement of molar extinction coefficient at 336 nm. We found that the drastic improvement is a result of the direct charge transfer from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of GNDs to the conduction bands of TiO2, enabled by wide/direct band gaps in GNDs with a small amount of oxygen. Also, the significantly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE ∼ 16.74%) and UV stability of the TiO2 NP/GND composites reveal their high promise for applications benefiting from TiO2 NP/GND composites, such as solar cells and photolysis."
"Evaluation of Polymer Alternating Waterflooding in Multilayered Heterogeneous Waterflooded Reservoir  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.Polymer flooding is widely implemented to improve oil recovery since polymer can increase sweep efficiency and smoothen heterogeneous reservoir profile. However, polymer solution is somewhat difficult to be injected due to high viscosity and thus, water slug is recommended to be injected before and during polymer injection in order to increase an ease of injecting this viscous fluid into the wellbore. In this study, numerical simulation is performed to determine the most appropriate operating parameters to maximize oil recovery. The results show that pre-flushed water should be injected until water breakthrough while alternating water slug size should be as low as 5% of polymer slug size. Concentration for each polymer slugs should be kept constant and recommended number of alternative cycles is 2. Combining these operating parameters altogether contributes to oil recovery of 53.69% whereas single-slug polymer flooding provides only 53.04% which is equivalent to 8,000 STB of oil gain."
"Effects of Formation Brine Compositions on Effectiveness of Low Salinity Brine Injection in Carbonate Reservoir  The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.Nowadays, Low Salinity Waterflooding (LSWF) is considered as one of the most effective techniques to enhance oil recovery. Essential mechanism is a Multi-Ion Exchange (MIE). In carbonate formation, collaboration of Potential Determining Ions (PDI) with rock surface and crude oil results in adjustment of surface equilibrium. These ions in injected brine are thoroughly investigated but effects from formation brine are not well documented. In this study, ratio of divalent ions including calcium and magnesium ions in formation brine is studied. Results from imbibition test shows that formation brine containing calcium ion to magnesium ion ratio of 1:1 yields response to LSWF. Oppositely, formation brines with high ratios of 10:1 and 15:1 do not respond to LSWF. As calcium ion in connate water diffuses to injected water, high calcium ion will exhibit dissolution mechanism of rock surface which is part of oil recovery mechanisms. Formation brine with high calcium ion is therefore not recommended for LSWF. High portion of magnesium ion in formation brine does not affect effectiveness of LSWF. Dissolution of magnesium from rock may be obstructed but oil can still be liberated from calcium carboxylate complex and dissolution of calcium. Coreflood test shows similar result which confirms previous explanation."
"Observation of t t H Production  2018 CERN.The observation of Higgs boson production in association with a top quark-antiquark pair is reported, based on a combined analysis of proton-proton collision data at center-of-mass energies of s=7, 8, and 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1, 19.7, and 35.9 fb-1, respectively. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The results of statistically independent searches for Higgs bosons produced in conjunction with a top quark-antiquark pair and decaying to pairs of W bosons, Z bosons, photons, τ leptons, or bottom quark jets are combined to maximize sensitivity. An excess of events is observed, with a significance of 5.2 standard deviations, over the expectation from the background-only hypothesis. The corresponding expected significance from the standard model for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV is 4.2 standard deviations. The combined best fit signal strength normalized to the standard model prediction is 1.26-0.26+0.31."
"Analysis of cutting-oil emulsion destabilization by aluminum sulfate  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The destabilization mechanism of the high stable cutting-oil emulsion by aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3) was investigated since it can affect properties of aggregates and following separation units. Al2(SO4)3 dosage and pH were key factors in the destabilization. The effective separation occurred when precipitated Al(OH)3 is dominated at the neutral pH of 6.5–7.0. The best separation can be achieved when solid flocs were formed at 1.0 mM, which exceeded the dosage from the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of 0.75 mM. Two different mechanisms were proved for the emulsion destabilization depending upon the Al3+ concentration under this pH range. The first mechanism was the adsorption of Al(OH)3 on surface of oil droplets, which led to the droplet coalescence. By increasing the Al3+ dosage, the sweep flocculation by Al(OH)3 precipitates occurred. Al3+ dosage for effective destabilization was increased in accordance with oil concentration. The formation of aluminum hydroxide precipitates in bayerite structure was affirmed by analyzing elemental composition and crystalline structure of flocs from the destablization."
"Search for high-mass resonances in dilepton final states in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV  2018, Springer Verlag. All rights reserved.A search is presented for new high-mass resonances decaying into electron or muon pairs. The search uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb−1. Observations are in agreement with standard model expectations. Upper limits on the product of a new resonance production cross section and branching fraction to dileptons are calculated in a model-independent manner. This permits the interpretation of the limits in models predicting a narrow dielectron or dimuon resonance. A scan of different intrinsic width hypotheses is performed. Limits are set on the masses of various hypothetical particles. For the Z′ SSM (Z′ ψ) particle, which arises in the sequential standard model (superstring-inspired model), a lower mass limit of 4.50 (3.90) TeV is set at 95% confidence level. The lightest Kaluza-Klein graviton arising in the Randall-Sundrum model of extra dimensions, with coupling parameters k/MPl of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, is excluded at 95% confidence level below 2.10, 3.65, and 4.25 TeV, respectively. In a simplified model of dark matter production via a vector or axial vector mediator, limits at 95% confidence level are obtained on the masses of the dark matter particle and its mediator."
"Near-horizon geodesics for astrophysical and idealised black holes: Coordinate velocity and coordinate acceleration  2018 by the authors. Geodesics (by definition) have an intrinsic 4-acceleration zero. However, when expressed in terms of coordinates, the coordinate acceleration d 2 x i /dt 2 can very easily be non-zero, and the coordinate velocity dx i /dt can behave unexpectedly. The situation becomes extremely delicate in the near-horizon limit-for both astrophysical and idealised black holes-where an inappropriate choice of coordinates can quite easily lead to significant confusion. We shall carefully explore the relative merits of horizon-penetrating versus horizon-non-penetrating coordinates, arguing that in the near-horizon limit the coordinate acceleration d 2 x i /dt 2 is best interpreted in terms of horizon-penetrating coordinates."
"Efficacy and Safety of Switching to Coformulated Elvitegravir, Cobicistat, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir Alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) in Virologically Suppressed Women Copyright  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Background: The integrase inhibitor regimen [elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)] demonstrated superior efficacy when compared with a protease inhibitor regimen [ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV + RTV) and FTC/TDF] in 575 treatment-naive women at week 48. We investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching to a TAF-based, single-tablet regimen containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, FTC, and tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) versus remaining on ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF. Methods: After completing the initial randomized, blinded phase, virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) women on ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF were rerandomized (3:1) to receive open-label E/C/F/TAF versus remaining on their current regimen. The primary end point was proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per milliliter at week 48 (U.S. FDA snapshot algorithm), with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 12%. Safety [adverse events (AEs)] and tolerability were also assessed. Results: Of 575 women originally randomized and treated in the blinded phase, 159 were rerandomized to switch to E/C/F/TAF and 53 to remain on ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF. At week 48, virologic suppression was maintained in 150 (94%) of women on E/C/F/TAF and 46 (87%) on ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF [difference 7.5% (95% confidence interval -1.2% to 19.4%)], demonstrating noninferiority of E/C/F/TAF to ATV + RTV and FTC/TDF. Incidence of AEs was similar between groups; study drug–related AEs were more common with E/C/F/TAF (11% versus 4%). Conclusions: Switching to E/C/F/TAF was noninferior to continuing ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF in maintaining virologic suppression and was well tolerated at 48 weeks."
"Occurrence of multidrug resistant (MDR) Campylobacter species isolated from retail chicken meats in Selangor, Malaysia and their associated risk factors  2018, Universiti Sains Malaysia.Aims: Campylobacter infection is one of the leading bacterial food-borne illness and most frequently reported in humans in developed countries. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) Campylobacter and the risk factors associated with their occurrence in broiler chicken meat retailed in markets. Methodology and results: A total of 210 samples consisting of 140 chicken meat and 70 swabs from weighing scales and cutting boards were collected. Isolates were cultured by passive filtration method, identified by biochemical tests and confirmed using PCR assay. Thirty-two (32/210) 15.2% were positive for Campylobacter of which (25/210) 11.9%, (6/210) 2.9% and (1/210) 0.5% were Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli and C. upsaliensis respectively. The isolates showed high resistance to ampicillin (62.5%), enrofloxacin (56.3%) and nalidixic acid (50.0%), while only 3.1% were resistant to streptomycin. Multidrug resistant isolates (resistance to at least one antibiotics in three classes or more) was high at 71.9%. The risk factors significantly (p < 0.05) associated with Campylobacter contamination on chicken's meat included poor workers hygiene (OR: 5.250 (95% CI: 0.988-27.895)), wearing improper work attire (OR: 2.700 (95% CI: 1.144- 6.374)), poor protective equipment (OR 38.50 (95% CI: 2.915-508.463)), poor environment/stall hygiene (OR 44.00 (95% CI: 2.193-882.66)), and using tiled counter top surface (OR 6.667 (95% CI: 0.597-74.506). Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The finding of this study affirmed that lack or poor work hygiene, unclean environmental stall and protective equipment are associated with high occurrence of multidrug resistant Campylobacter species isolated from chicken meat."
"Does adductor canal block have a synergistic effect with local infiltration analgesia for enhancing ambulation and improving analgesia after total knee arthroplasty?  2018 KOREAN KNEE SOCIETY.Purpose: We compared a single-injection adductor canal block (ACB) with or without local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for accelerating functional recovery and reducing postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Materials and Methods: Sixty-two patients undergoing TKA with simple spinal analgesia and ACB were randomized to receive either LIA (group A+L) or placebo LIA (group A). Postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and quadriceps strength, total dosage of rescue analgesia, time to first rescue analgesia, and adverse events were serially evaluated from postoperative day 1 to 3 months. Results: There were no differences between both groups in pre-and postoperative VAS, TUG test, quadriceps strength 2 days, 3 days, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. There were no differences in Knee Society clinical and function scores at 6 months and 1 year. However, group A+L had a significantly longer time for postoperative rescue analgesia (491 minutes vs. 143 minutes, p=0.04) with less patients requiring rescue analgesia during 6 hours after surgery (16.7% vs. 43.3%, p=0.024). Both groups had similarly high rates of patient satisfaction with low adverse event rates. Conclusions: Combined ACB and LIA in TKA enhanced early ambulation with reduced and delayed rescue analgesia."
"Systematic review and meta-analysis of effectiveness of preoperative embolization in surgery for metastatic spine disease  Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018. All rights reserved.Background: Preoperative embolization (PE) may decrease intraoperative blood loss (IBL) in decompressive surgery of hypervascular spinal metastases. However, no consensus has been found in other metastases and no meta-analysis which reviewed the benefit of PE in spinal metastases has been conducted. Objective To assess IBL in spinal metastases surgery in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and cohort studies comparing PE and a control group of non-embolized patients. Methods: A systematic search of relevant publications in PubMed and EMBASE was undertaken. Inclusion criteria were RCTs and observational studies in patients with spinal metastases who underwent spine surgery and reported IBL. Meta-analysis was performed using standardized mean difference (SMD) and mean difference (MD) of IBL. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Results: A total of 265 abstracts (126 from PubMed and 139 from Embase) were identified through database searching. The reviewers selected six studies for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. The pooled SMD of the included studies was 0.58 (95% CI-0.10 to 1.25, p=0.09). Sensitivity analysis revealed that, if the study by Rehak et al was omitted, the pooled SMD was significantly changed to 0.88 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.36, p<0.001) and PE reduced the IBL significantly. The pooled MD was 708.3 mL (95% CI-224.4 to 1640.9 mL, p=0.14). If the results of the Rehak et al study were omitted, the pooled MD was significantly changed to 1226.9 mL (95% CI 345.8 to 2108.1 mL, p=0.006). Conclusions: PE can be effective in reducing IBL in spinal metastases surgery in both renal cell carcinoma and mixed primary tumor groups."
"Accuracy of blood beta-hydroxybutyrate and plasma acetoacetate for diagnosis of canine diabetic ketoacidosisความแม่นยาของค่าเบตาไฮดรอกซีบิวทิเรตในเลือดและค่าอะซิโตอะซิเตทในพลาสมา เพื่อการวินิจฉัยภาวะเลือดเป็นกรดจากคีโตนจากเบาหวานในสุนัข  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House.Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication in diabetic dogs. It is caused by an increase in production and accumulation of ketone bodies in the blood, which results in metabolic acidosis. The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy between the measurement of blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) concentration using a point-of-care sensor and plasma acetoacetate (AcAc) level using a urine strip test for the diagnosis of canine DKA. A total of 60 dogs were enrolled into each group: DKA (n=16), diabetic ketosis (DK) (n=5), and control (n=39). The following parameters including blood β-OHB, plasma AcAc, blood glucose, urinary AcAc, urinary glucose, and blood gas analysis were evaluated and compared among the groups. Both DKA and DK groups had higher concentrations of blood β-OHB and blood glucose than the control group (P < 0.001), but no statistical difference was found between the DKA and DK groups. Likewise, plasma and urinary AcAc were detected only in the DKA and DK dogs, but there were no significant differences between the groups. The sensitivity and specificity of the β-OHB POC sensor had a wide variation at various cut-off values. However, the cut-off value of blood β-OHB concentration at 2.1 mmol/L revealed 100% sensitivity. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma AcAc varied extensively at cut-off values ranging from 0 to 3+. Therefore, the presence or absence of plasma AcAc could not be used to diagnose dogs with DKA. Instead, blood β-OHB at the concentration of ≥ 2.1 mmol/L should be used for the screening of DKA.การเกิดภาวะเลือดเป็นกรดจากคีโตนจากเบาหวาน (DKA) ในสุนัขจัดเป็นภาวะแทรกซ้อนที่ร้ายแรงถึงชีวิต ซึ่งเป็นผลมาจากการสร้างและการสะสมของสารคีโตนในกระแสเลือดที่เพิ่มขึ้นจนส่งผลให้เกิดภาวะกรดจากการเผาผลาญ วัตถุประสงค์ของการศึกษานี้เพื่อเปรียบเทียบความแม่นยาระหว่างการวัดความเข้มข้นของเบตาไฮดรอกซีบิวทิเรตซึ่งวัดด้วยเครื่องตรวจวิเคราะห์ ณ จุดที่ดูแลสัตว์ป่วย และค่าอะซิโตอะซิเตทในพลาสมาซึ่งตรวจด้วยแผ่นจุ่มตรวจปัสสาวะ เพื่อวินิจฉัยภาวะ DKA โดย แบ่งสุนัขจานวน 60 ตัวออกเป็นกลุ่มที่มีภาวะ DKA (16 ตัว) กลุ่มที่เป็นโรคเบาหวานร่วมกับมีคีโตนแต่ไม่พบภาวะกรดจากการเผาผลาญ (DK) (5 ตัว) และกลุ่มควบคุม (39 ตัว) ทาการวัดและเปรียบเทียบพารามิเตอร์ระหว่างกลุ่ม ได้แก่ ระดับน้าตาลในเลือด เบตาไฮดรอกซีบิวทิเรตในเลือด อะซิโตอะซิเตทในพลาสมา การวิเคราะห์กรดด่างในเลือด ระดับน้าตาลในปัสสาวะ และอะซิโตอะซิเตทในปัสสาวะ การศึกษาพบว่า สุนัขกลุ่ม DKA และ DK มีความเข้มข้นของเบตาไฮดรอกซีบิวทิเรตในเลือดสูงกว่ากลุ่มควบคุมอย่างมีนัยสาคัญทางสถิติ (P < 0.0001) แต่ไม่พบความแตกต่างระหว่างกลุ่มทั้งสอง ตรวจพบอะซิโตอะซิเตทในพลาสมาและปัสสาวะเฉพาะในสุนัขกลุ่ม DKA และ DK แต่ไม่พบความแตกต่างระหว่างสองกลุ่มนี้เช่นกัน ค่าความไวและความจาเพาะของเบตาไฮดรอกซีบิวทิเรตในเลือดเปลี่ยนแปลงไปตามค่าที่อ่านผลเป็นบวก (cut-off value) แต่ละค่า อย่างไรก็ดี cut-off value ของเบตาไฮดรอกซีบิวทิเรตในเลือดสูงสุดที่ 2.1 mmol/L มีความไว 100% ในขณะที่ค่าความไวและความจาเพาะของอะซิโตอะซิเตทในพลาสมาเปลี่ยนแปลงอย่างมากในช่วงระดับ 0 ถึง 3+ การตรวจพบหรือไม่พบอะซิโตอะซิเตทในพลาสมาจึงไม่สามารถวินิจฉัย DKA ได้อย่างแม่นยา และผลการศึกษาในครั้งนี้แนะนาให้ใช้ค่าเบตาไฮดรอกซีบิวทิเรตในเลือดตั้งแต่ 2.1 mmol/L เพื่อคัดกรองสุนัขที่มีภาวะ DKA."

Six cats histologically confirmed with SCC accounted for T2 (33.33%), T3 (33.33%), and T4 (33.33%) were included in this study. CO2 laser was used to excise SCC lesion and clinical outcomes were followed up. The CO2 laser minimised blood loss during surgery and the mild inflammation of surgical wound was controlled after surgery. All cats that underwent surgical excision using CO2 laser showed complete wound healing in a median of time at 27 days after surgery. Tumor recurrence and disease free interval (DFI) were recorded and statistically analyzed. The overall median time of recurrence was 150 days after surgery and there was a significant correlation between the stage of tumor and local recurrence. Lesions in the early stage of SCC showed longer DFI than those in the advanced stage. Therefore, the use of CO2 laser could be considered as an alternative way of surgery for early stage of feline nasal planum SCC."

Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) was found to increase in valves of DMVD dogs. However, plasma TGF-β1 concentrations in dogs with DMVD have not been evaluated before. The objective of the present study was to compare the plasma concentration of TGF-β1 between normal dogs and dogs with DMVD by using an ELISA technique. This measurement might help to distinguish dogs with DMVD from healthy dogs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare plasma TGF-β1 concentrations between the two groups. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results showed no statistical difference (p=0.574) between the median plasma TGF-β1 concentrations of 22 normal dogs (1.14, range 0.94-1.33 ng/ml) and 27 DMVD dogs (1.21, range 0.92-1.32 ng/ml). In conclusion, the concentration of TGF-β1 is very low in the circulation; it may not be a suitable marker for the diagnosis of DMVD due to its sensitivity."

The standard care for vertebral body stabilisation of canine VFL is the use of screws with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and the string of pearls (SOP) plate system fixation. VFL with implants are usually exposed to force in a repetitive or cyclic loading fashion. Indeed, stress on the implant cyclically at a load significantly less than its ultimate tensile strength can cause fatigue failure, one of the major causes of implant breakage. This study aims to compare the fatigue property and failure mode of four different implants in canine cadaveric VFL. The four different implants were constructed as follows: 3.5 mm cancellous screw with manually applied PMMA (MP), 3.5 mm cancellous screws with syringe application of PMMA (CanP), 3.5 mm cortical screws with syringe application of PMMA (CorP) and 3.5 mm cortical screws with a SOP plate (SOP). Results revealed that the SOP group tolerated the most cycles before failure, followed by the CorP, CanP and MP groups, respectively. The point of weakness, as defined by the failure mode, occurred in the middle of PMMA bridge (MP group), neck of the cancellous screw (CanP group), PMMA at the screw neck (CorP group), and 3.5 mm cortical screw (SOP group), respectively. In conclusion, based on the fatigue properties of the four implants tested in this study, the SOP plate is recommended as a standard fixation device for VFL in dogs."
"Failure to conceive in deslorelin-induced oestrous bitches with regard to removal of hormone implants after ovulationการผสมไม่ติดในสุนัขที่เหนี่ยวนาการเป็นสัดด้วยฮอร์โมนเดสโรเลอริน และถอดฮอร์โมนออกหลังการตกไข่  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House.Removal of a GnRH agonist deslorelin implant either before or during ovulation in deslorelin-induced oestrous bitches is suggested because prolonged administration of the slow-release agonist may compromise luteal function secondary to pituitary down-regulation. This study aimed at investigating the effect of 4.7 mg deslorelin (Suprelorin®) on oestrous induction, ovulation and conception rate after removing the implant 72-96 hours post-ovulation to ensure that the entire ovulation process was complete. Ovulation began when serum progesterone reached 5-6 ng/mL. The implants were inserted subcutaneously in the umbilical area in 5 healthy, intact anoestrous beagles (1.5-3 years). Time of implantation was considered as Day 0, and time elapsed from Day 0 to oestrous induction was calculated. In all bitches, vaginal cytology was abruptly changed on Day 3, and oestrous signs were observed on Day 5 post-implantation. Ovulation occurred in all treated bitches on Days 11.4±0.9 (ranging from 11-13 days) post-implantation. Transcervical artificial inseminations (TCAI) with chilled semen ( > 75% sperm motility) using Scandinavian catheter were performed on the 2nd and 4th day post-ovulation. Pregnancy was confirmed on Days 32-35 post-TCAI by transabdominal ultrasonography and serum relaxin test (WITNESS® Relaxin). No foetuses were detected and the relaxin tests were negative (pregnancy rate = 0%). Of all bitches, progesterone levels were within a normal range throughout the dioestrus period (62 days). The unsuccessful pregnancy outcome was possibly related to the delayed removal of the implants. Further study should be conducted to investigate physiological changes in follicular development, ovulatory process, oocyte quality, oviduct and uterine environment of oestrous-induced bitches in relation to the time of implant removal.การเหนี่ยวนาการเป็นสัดในสุนัขเพศเมียด้วยการฝังฮอร์โมนจีเอ็นอาร์เอชอะโกนิส เดสโลเรอลิน มีคาแนะนาว่าควรเอาเม็ดฮอร์โมนสังเคราะห์ออกเมื่อสุนัขแสดงอาการเป็นสัดในช่วงก่อนหรือระหว่างตกไข่ เนื่องจากหากไม่นาออกจะทาให้เกิดการกดการทางานของเนื้อเยื่อลูเตียลและส่งผลต่อการลดลงของระดับโปรเจสเตอโรนเมื่อสุนัขตั้งท้อง การศึกษานี้มีวัตถุประสงค์เพื่อศึกษาผลของการฝังเดสโรเรอลินขนาด 4.7 มิลลิกรัมใต้ผิวหนังต่อการเหนี่ยวนาการเป็นสัด การตกไข่ และการตั้งท้อง หากนาเม็ดฮอร์โมนออกภายหลังการตกไข่เสร็จสิ้นสมบูรณ์ (72-96 ชั่วโมง) โดยการตกไข่เริ่มเกิดขึ้นเมื่อระดับซีรั่มโปรเจสเตอโรนอยู่ที่ 5-6 นาโนกรัมต่อมิลลิลิตร ทาการฝังฮอร์โมนบริเวณสะดือของสุนัขบีเกิ้ล 5 ตัว อายุ 1.5-3 ปี ซึ่งอยู่ในระยะแอนเอสตรัส ภายหลังการฝังฮอร์โมนสุนัขทุกตัวมีอาการเป็นสัดอย่างชัดเจน เซลล์เยื่อบุช่องคลอดเปลี่ยนแปลงในวันที่ 3 และปากช่องคลอดบวมแดง มีของเหลวปนเลือดออกจากช่องคลอดในวันที่ 5 หลังฝังฮอร์โมน ไข่ตกวันที่ 11.4±0.9 (ช่วง 11-13 วัน) ทาการผสมเทียมโดยการปล่อยน้าเชื้อในมดลูกในวันที่ 2 และ 4 หลังไข่ตก ตรวจการตั้งท้องในวันที่ 32-35 หลังผสมด้วยชุดตรวจรีแลกซินในกระแสเลือดและอัลตร้าซาวน์มดลูก พบว่าสุนัขทั้ง 5 ตัวไม่ตั้งท้อง ระดับโปรเจสเตอโรนในกระแสเลือดอยู่ในช่วงค่าปกติของระยะไดเอสตรัสตลอดระยะเวลา 62 วันหลังฝังฮอร์โมน การผสมไม่ติดในการศึกษานี้อาจเป็นผลมาจากช่วงเวลาที่นาฮอร์โมนออกไม่เหมาะสม ในอนาคตควรมีการศึกษาต่อไปถึงการเปลี่ยนแปลงทางสรีรวิทยาของการตกไข่ คุณภาพของไข่ที่ตก การเปลี่ยนแปลงของท่อนาไข่และมดลูก ซึ่งอาจมีความสัมพันธ์กับช่วงเวลาต่าง ๆ ที่นาเม็ดฮอร์โมนออก."
"Left ventricular dilatation and posterior papillary muscle displacement in an Ex vivo pulsatile model of functional mitral regurgitation  2018 Forum Multimedia Publishing, LLC.Background: Surgical method of choice for functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is debatable, since recurrence of FMR post-annuloplasty has been reported in a significant number of cases. Developing a pulsatile FMR heart model by left ventricular dilatation can be a favorable option for usage in the primary stages of developing new surgical techniques that adjunctively targets the posterior papillary muscle (PPM) geometry. Methods: PPM of ex vivo ovine hearts (N = 22) was displaced by three different sizes of patches to induce left ventricular dilatation and FMR. Mitral regurgitation (MR) flow, left ventricular and annular geometry were measured from the dynamic pulsatile flow system before and after patch placement. Results: Outward displacement of PPM was significantly increased in all patch sizes compared to baseline (P = .016, P = .031, and P = .008 from small to large patch, respectively). Left ventricular volume (LVV) significantly increased from 18.53 (15.01-26.03) mL at baseline to 27.5 (19.45-42.46) mL after large patch placement (P = .031). However, the small and medium patch groups did not show significant changes in the LVV after patch placement. MR significantly increased 554 (185-1,919.3) mL/min after applying the large patch compared to baseline (P = .016). There were no significant changes from baseline in MR flow after applying the small and medium patch. Application of the large patch produced the highest proportion of FMR heart models (87.5%, P = .031). Conclusion: The large patch ex vivo pulsatile heart model demonstrated outward displacement of the PPM and significantly produced MR flow. This ex vivo pulsatile heart model can be used to facilitate surgical techniques that targets the PPM displacement in FMR patients."
"Deprivation of citizenship, undocumented labor and human trafficking: Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand  Regions & Cohesion.Thailand is a popular destination for irregular labor migration from Myanmar. Among some three million Burmese migrant workers in Thailand, more than half are undocumented. Undocumented migrant workers rely on brokers to smuggle them into Thailand. Some undocumented migrant workers are lured, tricked, and forced to work but they are not rewarded with a reasonable wage. A conceptual framework of the shadow sector of labor migration is formulated in this study, which attempts to explain why ethnic minorities in Myanmar are socially categorized by the level of their deprived citizenship. Those low in the hierarchy of categorization are likely to fall into the shadow sector of the labor migration process. Ethnic minorities from areas of insurgency are exposed to a high risk of human trafficking."
"Paleomagnetic Study on the Permian Rocks of the Indochina Block and Its Implications for Paleogeographic Configuration and Northward Drifting of Cathaysialand in the Paleo-Tethys 2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The drift of Gondwana-derived blocks across the Tethys has remained unclear specifically because one of the largest components, Indochina, has remained unconstrained by paleomagnetism during the late Paleozoic, the interval comprising the first half of its journey towards the Eurasian landmass. Hence, we report a paleomagnetic study of Early-Middle Permian limestones from central Thailand yielding a high-quality data set for the Indochina Block with probable primary origin. The magnetization yields a paleomagnetic pole at 34.1°N, 331.7°E (K = 45.4, A95 = 5.7°) corresponding to a paleolatitude of 21.2 ± 5.7°S at the center of the study area (15°N, 101°E) and supporting a tropical restoration for late Paleozoic Indochina. A total of ~5,000 km northward transition from a proximity to Gondwana in the Early-Middle Permian (ca. 280 Ma) to the southern margin of Eurasia by the Late Triassic (Norian, ca. 220 Ma) is identified and yields an average northward latitudinal drift rate of ~4.5 cm/year. A concurrent northward drifting history during the Permian is suggested for the Indochina, North Qiangtang, and South China blocks, and thus, the widely used model of Permian Cathaysialand is quantitively supported when combined with their paleobiogeographic affinities."
"Supporting the understanding investor behavior and the effective communication  2018 Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad, India.Understanding the risk characteristic of financial product is a crucial point for investment decision. Basically, the risk measurement which currently used in key investor information documents is “standard deviations” as the risk category. This document provides critical information for retail investors. Standard deviation is utilized as a risk measurement tool in traditional finance, however, some arguments stated the validation of this measurement such as the multidimensionality of risk and the accuracy of subjective measurement. Consequently, this research aims to investigate the insight of investors’ risk perception and measurement under financial scenario experiment. The experimental design was setting data from expected return and possibility to gain and loss collaborated with mathematical computing for generating the characteristic of measurements. The results are particularly useful in financial investment context and also support the understanding investor behavior and the effective communication between financial regulators, advisors and investors."
"A Path Analysis of the Effects of Biopsychosocial Factors on the Onset of Nonspecific Low Back Pain in Office Workers  2018Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a conceptual model for the association between various biopsychosocial factors and nonspecific low back pain (LBP) in a sample of office workers. Methods: A 1-year prospective cohort study of 669 healthy office workers was conducted. At baseline, a self-administered questionnaire and standardized physical examination were employed to gather biopsychosocial data. Follow-up data were collected every month for the incidence of LBP. A regression model was built to analyze factors predicting the onset of LBP. Path analysis was performed to examine direct and indirect associations between identified risk factors and LBP. Results: The onset of LBP was predicted by history of LBP, frequency of rest breaks, and psychological demand, measured by the Job Content Questionnaire. All 3 factors directly related to LBP; history of LBP was the strongest effector on the onset of LBP. History of LBP and frequency of rest breaks had indirect effects on LBP that were mediated through psychological demand, and frequency of rest breaks was the most influential effector on psychological demand. Conclusions: Three risk factors were identified to predict onset LBP, including history of LBP, frequency of rest breaks, and psychological demand. Each factor had direct effects on the development of LBP. Also, history of LBP and frequency of rest breaks had indirect effects on LBP that were mediated through psychological demand."
"Three-Stage Anaerobic Sequencing Batch Reactor (ASBR) for maximum methane production: Effects of COD loading rate and reactor volumetric ratio  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A three-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor system was developed as a new anaerobic process with an emphasis on methane production from ethanol wastewater. The three-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor system consisted of three bioreactors connected in series. It was operated at 37◦C with a fixed recycle ratio of 1:1 (final effluent flow rate to feed flow rate) and the washout sludge from the third bioreactor present in the final effluent was allowed to be recycled to the first bioreactor. The pH of the first bioreactor was controlled at 5.5, while the pH values of the other two bioreactors were not controlled. Under the optimum chemical oxygen demand loading rate of 18 kg/m3d (based on the feed chemical oxygen demand load and total volume of the three bioreactors) with a bioreactor volumetric ratio of 5:5:20, the system provided the highest gas production performance in terms of yields of both hydrogen and methane and the highest overall chemical oxygen demand removal. Interestingly, the three-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor system gave a much higher energy production rate and a higher optimum chemical oxygen demand loading rate than previously reported anaerobic systems since it was able to maintain very high microbial concentrations in all bioreactors with very high values of both alkalinity and solution pH, especially in the third bioreactor, resulting in sufficient levels of micronutrients for anaerobic digestion."

"Effect of organisational communication and culture on employee motivation and its impact on employee performance  Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.Human Resource Management is one of the most important factors in a company’s operations. When changes happen, employees need to adapt to the work environment and this can influence many aspects of employees’ working life. The performance of employees will influence the performance of an organisation and one of the factors that influences employee performance is employee motivation. The changes can be through communication and culture differences. Television broadcasting service companies must focus on their human resource because they employ a large number of workers. There are 19 major television companies in Indonesia. The broadcasting industry is one of the pioneers of private television stations in Indonesia. Media Citra Nusantara owns RCTI, Global TV and iNews TV. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of organisational communication and organisational culture on employee motivation and its impact on employee performance in the broadcasting industry. The method of data collection used in this study is the questionnaire. Questionnaires were distributed to 300 employees. The data analysis method used in this study is path analysis. The results of this study shows that organisational culture does not influence employee performance, while organisational communication and employee motivation influence employee performance."
"Search for high-mass resonances in final states with a lepton and missing transverse momentum at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for new high-mass resonances in proton-proton collisions having final states with an electron or muon and missing transverse momentum is presented. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The transverse mass distribution of the charged lepton-neutrino system is used as the discriminating variable. No significant deviation from the standard model prediction is found. The best limit, from the combination of electron and muon channels, is 5.2 TeV at 95% confidence level for the mass of a W′ boson with the same couplings as those of the standard model W boson. Exclusion limits of 2.9 TeV are set on the inverse radius of the extra dimension in the framework of split universal extra dimensions. In addition, model-independent limits are set on the production cross section and coupling strength of W′ bosons decaying into this final state. An interpretation is also made in the context of an R parity violating supersymmetric model with a slepton as a mediator and flavor violating decay.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Search for a new scalar resonance decaying to a pair of Z bosons in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for a new scalar resonance decaying to a pair of Z bosons is performed in the mass range from 130 GeV to 3 TeV, and for various width scenarios. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The Z boson pair decays are reconstructed using the 4ℓ, 2ℓ2q, and 2ℓ2ν final states, where ℓ = e or μ. Both gluon fusion and electroweak production of the scalar resonance are considered, with a free parameter describing their relative cross sections. A dedicated categorization of events, based on the kinematic properties of associated jets, and matrix element techniques are employed for an optimal signal and background separation. A description of the interference between signal and background amplitudes for a resonance of an arbitrary width is included. No significant excess of events with respect to the standard model expectation is observed and limits are set on the product of the cross section for a new scalar boson and the branching fraction for its decay to ZZ for a large range of masses and widths.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Effects of framing on earthquake risk perception in Chiang Rai, Thailand  2018, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.The effects of framing are important to the perception of earthquake risk. This research investigated the effects of framing on the people’s perception of earthquake risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. There were three frames conveying the same earthquake risk but presented in different terms. These statements were in frequency terms of building damage: 475 severely damaged private buildings in 500 years, 10% chance of occurrence in 50 years, and one severely damaged private building per year. The objective of this research was to determine whether framing the same earthquake risk in different terms led to different perceptions of the risk by different people, leading to 1. what would be the most effective framing type regarding severely damaged private buildings, 2. which affected people’s earthquake risk perception most, and 3. whether experiencing an earthquake disaster would change the risk perception of the residents. The result showed that presenting the risk as “one severely damaged private building per year” was the most commonly selected among the three frames and was statistically significant. This finding clarifies that short time frames influence people’s earthquake risk decisions, and agencies can effectively use framing to communicate the earthquake risk to people in seismic regions to stimulate their earthquake preparedness and to reduce future earthquake risk. However, earthquake experience does not change the risk perception of the residents."
"Perioperative anesthetic adverse events in Thailand (Paad Thai): Incident reporting study: An analysis of 69 perioperative adverse events in patients undergoing cesarean section  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: The Royal College of Anesthesiologists of Thailand initiated registry and reporting of anesthesia service incidents and outcomes in 2015 [Perioperative Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand (PAAd Thai)]. Cesarean section (C-section) was associated with significantly increased risks of anesthesia-related adverse events. All details in these adverse events were important issues to improve maternal safety and outcomes. Objective: To describe the incidents regarding, characteristics and outcomes of anesthetic-related adverse events in the C-section patients in PAAd Thai. Materials and Methods: This study was a multicenter descriptive study of data prospectively collected from 22 hospitals across Thailand between January 1 and December 31, 2015. We extracted relevant data from the incident reports on C-section patients. Three peer reviewers reviewed the completed incident record forms regarding possible mechanisms, contributing factors, appropriate management, and preventive strategies to achieve agreement by a consensus. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Results: Total 2,206 incidents of adverse events were reported from 333,219 cases in primary PAAd Thai. The incidents occurred in 57 parturient patients undergoing cesarean section (C-section).Most of C-section patients were ASA physical status class II (54.5%) and mostly were indicated with emergency reasons (57.1%). The most common anesthetic techniques were general anesthesia (59.6%). The common place and period that the events occurs were intraoperative period (63.16%) (Including induction, intubation, maintenance and emergence) and 28.07% of events were preventable. The three common adverse events included desaturation (17.39%), esophageal intubation (15.94 %) and drug error (14.49 %). Most common immediate and long term outcome were major transient physiologic changes and complete recovery (40.43% and 89.36%, respectively). The most common contributing factor was human factor (75.76%) including inexperience, haste, inadequate knowledge (36.36%, 18.18% and 10.61%, respectively). Improved supervision, quality assurance activity, following guideline practice and additional training could be suggestive corrective strategies to minimizing these adverse events. Conclusion: The authors found that inexperience, haste, and inadequate knowledge were the major contributory factors. Some of them (28%) were preventable and correctable. Supervision, quality assurance, complies to practice guideline and additional training can improve and prevent these serious adverse events, also provide patient safety in the Thai health care system."
"Network-based association analysis to infer new disease-gene relationships using large-scale protein interactions  2018 Suratanee, Plaimas. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Protein-protein interactions integrated with disease-gene associations represent important information for revealing protein functions under disease conditions to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of complex diseases. Although several studies have attempted to identify disease-gene associations, the number of possible disease-gene associations is very small. High-throughput technologies have been established experimentally to identify the association between genes and diseases. However, these techniques are still quite expensive, time consuming, and even difficult to perform. Thus, based on currently available data and knowledge, computational methods have served as alternatives to provide more possible associations to increase our understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, a new network-based algorithm, namely, Disease-Gene Association (DGA), was developed to calculate the association score of a query gene to a new possible set of diseases. First, a large-scale protein interaction network was constructed, and the relationship between two interacting proteins was calculated with regard to the disease relationship. Novel plausible disease-gene pairs were identified and statistically scored by our algorithm using neighboring protein information. The results yielded high performance for disease-gene prediction, with an F-measure of 0.78 and an AUC of 0.86. To identify promising candidates of disease-gene associations, the association coverage of genes and diseases were calculated and used with the association score to perform gene and disease selection. Based on gene selection, we identified promising pairs that exhibited evidence related to several important diseases, e.g., inflammation, lipid metabolism, inborn errors, xanthomatosis, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive deterioration, malignant neoplasms of the skin and malignant tumors of the cervix. Focusing on disease selection, we identified target genes that were important to blistering skin diseases and muscular dystrophy. In summary, our developed algorithm is simple, efficiently identifies disease–gene associations in the protein-protein interaction network and provides additional knowledge regarding disease-gene associations. This method can be generalized to other association studies to further advance biomedical science."
"Hemodynamic and echocardiographic alterations in beta-thalassemia hemoglobin e patients receiving regular transfusion and iron chelation therapy  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: Beta-thalassemia hemoglobin E (beta-thal/HbE) is the commonest beta-thalassemia disease. Cardiovascular complications are still the leading cause of death in these patients. Regular transfusion with iron chelation has been currently more employed. Yet studies on hemodynamic and cardiovascular changes in this particular patients are still lacking. We aimed to define hemodynamic and cardiovascular characteristics in beta-thal/HbE patients receiving regular transfusion concomitant with iron chelation compared to healthy controls. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study of 40 beta-thal/HbE patients receiving regular transfusion and iron chelation over one year and 40 age-sex-matched healthy controls was conducted. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated. Results: The age (mean ± SD) of patients was 34±10 years. Beta-thal/HbE patients demonstrated significant differences in following parameters compared to healthy controls (all p<0.001): mean blood pressure (76.7±8.7 vs. 86.8±10.8 mmHg), stroke index (51.3±12.7 vs. 36.7±8.3 ml/m2), cardiac output index (3.9±1.1 vs. 2.5±0.6 L/min), vascular resistance index (9.81±3.28 vs. 12.42±2.26 mm·min/L·m2), systemic arterial compliance index (1.26±0.48 vs. 0.69±0.22ml/m2/mmHg), left ventricular systolic and diastolic volume index (48.2±14.0 vs. 37.4±9.2 and19.1±5.7 vs. 13.2±4.2 ml/m2). Biventricular systolic and left ventricular diastolic functions were well-preserved. Pulmonary arterial pressure was significantly elevated in beta-thal/HbE. However, the prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was 20% which was lower than previous populations receiving occasional transfusion. Conclusion: Cardiovascular features compensating for longstanding anemia remain detectable in beta-thal/HbE patients receiving regular transfusion and iron chelation. Higher cardiac output, lower systemic vascular resistance and an enlarged left ventricular chamber were found in this particular population. However, systolic and diastolic functions remained well-preserved despite chronic transfusion."
"Medication errors and adverse drug events: Analysis from perioperative anesthetic adverse events in Thailand (PAAD Thai study)  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: Perioperative medication administration can lead to the higher rate and severity of medication errors (MEs). This epidemiological study aimed to assess the current situation in Thailand regarding the frequency, types, severity, contributing factors and suggested corrective strategies of MEs related to anesthesia care. Materials and Methods: The prospective multi-center observational study was conducted in 22 university and non-university hospitals across Thailand. Data were collected during January 1 and December 31, 2015. MEs incidents were reported and filled out in the standardized incident reporting form on an anonymous and voluntary basis. All completed forms of MEs related to anesthesia were reviewed and discussed by peer reviewers who used the “Medication Error Detection Framework” to identify type of MEs, contributing factors and suggestive prevention strategies. Results: There were 85 relevant reports of MEs from the first 2,206 incident reports (4.25% of all incident reports). Overdosage (25 incidents, 29.4%) was the most frequently found types of error. 10 incidents (40%) occurred in pediatric patients. Wrong drug administration (19 incidents, 22.4%) was the second frequently found type of error including syringe swaps or wrong ampule. Labelling errors were reported for 15 events (17.6%). 16 incidents (18.8%) were caused temporary patient harm or prolong hospital stay. All of the incidents were related to human error and considered preventable. Conclusion: 4.25% of MEs were reported in our study, which comparable to the previous report from Thailand in 2007. Overdosage was the most frequently found type of errors. Pediatric patients were considered a high risk group. All of the incidents were related to human error and considered preventable.

All rights reserved.Background: Dyslipidemia is one of the risk factor of coronary artery disease. but there have been reports showing paradoxical effect of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level which lower LDL-C level at the time of diagnosis of patients with acute coronary syndrome was associated with higher 1-year mortality. However, this relationship has not been established in Thai patients. Objective: To evaluate LDL-C and 1-year all-cause mortality rate after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Thailand. Materials and Methods: The present study was a retrospective study of 1,542 consecutive patients with STEMI from 1999 to 2015 whom underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) either primary PCI or rescue PCI at a tertiary care hospital in Thailand. Patients were classified into 4 groups according to their initial LDL-C level: <70 (group 1), 70-99 (group 2), 100-129 (group 3) and ≥130 mg/dl (group 4). The primary end point was a 1-year all-cause mortality rate. T-test, Chi-square and survival time analysis were used to analyze. Results: The rates of 1-year all-cause mortality were 23.0%, 21.2%, 12.3% and 9.2% in group 1, group 2, group 3 and group 4, respectively. Comparing with group 4, the hazard ratio (HR) was 2.72 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.62-4.57; P<0.001) for group 1, HR 2.45 (95% CI 1.64-3.66; p<0.001) for group 2 and HR 1.35 (95% CI 0.89-2.06; p=0.153) for group 3. In multivariate analysis, the predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality were Killip class IV (HR 2.40, 95% CI 1.78-3.25; p<0.001), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (HR 2.25, CI 1.64-3.09; p<0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.57-2.72; p<0.001), culprit lesion at left main (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13-2.81; p=0.024), creatinine >1.5 mg/dl (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.32-2.38; p<0.001), but not the LDL-C level (p=0.732) Conclusion: In this single center experience, lower LDL-C level at time of diagnosis of STEMI was associated with higher 1-year all-cause mortality but the effect was not shown after multivariate analysis. This represent LDL-C was not the risk factor to predict 1-year all-cause mortality in STEMI but there were other factors that associated with the outcome. LDL-C was independent risk marker."
"T-duality and high-derivative gravity theories: the BTZ black hole/string paradigm  2018, The Author(s).We show that the temperature and entropy of a BTZ black hole are invariant under T-duality to next to leading order in M⋆− 2, M⋆ being the scale suppressing higher-curvature/derivative terms in the Lagrangian. We work in the framework of a twoparameter family of theories exhibiting T-duality, which includes (but goes beyond) String Theory. Interestingly enough, the AdS/CFT correspondence enforces quantization conditions on these parameters. In the particular case of bosonic/heterotic string theory, our results extend those of a classical paper by Horowitz and Welch. For generic (albeit quantized) values of the parameters, it suggests that T-duality might be an interesting tool to constrain consistent low-energy effective actions while entailing physical equivalences outside String Theory. Moreover, it generates a new family of regular asymptotically flat black string solutions in three-dimensions."
"The two-dimensional twisted reduced principal chiral model revisited  2018, The Author(s).Motivated by our previous study of the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai model for non minimal twists, we re-examined the behaviour of the reduced version of the two dimensional principal chiral model. We show that this single matrix model reproduces the same features as the standard lattice model. In particular, scaling towards the continuum limit, the correct value of the internal energy, the magnetic susceptibility and the mass gap. Given our capacity to reach larger values of N, we use the reduced model to study the nature and properties of its large N phase transition existing at intermediate coupling. We conclude that the transition is of first order."
"Strength and stiffness parameters of Bangkok clays for finite element analysis  2018 Southeast Asian Geotechnical Society. All Rights Reserved.Constitutive soil model and its parameters are the important issue in finite element analysis. Hardening soil model and Mohr-Coulomb model parameters of Bangkok clays for finite element analysis were evaluated in this study. To achieve this purpose, a case study of Sukhumvit MRT Station was selected to model in three dimensions with hardening soil and Mohr-Coulomb models. The instrumented data during construction was used to compare with the results from finite element analysis. PLAXIS 3D software was adopted as solving tool in this study. Lateral wall movement and ground surface settlement predictions were used to compare with the data. The outcomes were concluded that the hardening soil model characterised the Bangkok clay better than Mohr-Coulomb model in 3D finite element analysis for excavation."
"Chemical constituents from the root bark of calophyllum inophyllum  2018 Natural Product Incorporation. All rights reserved.A new chromanone derivative, namely caloinophyllin B (1), along with seventeen known compounds 2-18 were isolated from the root bark of Calophyllum inophyllum. The structures of all isolated compounds (1-18) were determined by spectroscopic methods as well as comparison with previous reports in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, compounds 1, 3, 6, 8, 11-14 and 16 were isolated from this plant for the first time. Moreover, all isolated compounds (1-18) were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against KB and Hela S-3 cell lines. Compound 8 exhibited moderate activity toward KB and Hela S-3cells with the IC50 values of 25.8 and 18.1μM, respectively."
"Measurement of prompt and nonprompt charmonium suppression in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.The nuclear modification factors of J / ψ and ψ(2S) mesons are measured in PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of sNN=5.02TeV. The analysis is based on PbPb and p p data samples collected by CMS at the LHC in 2015, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 464μb-1 and 28pb-1, respectively. The measurements are performed in the dimuon rapidity range of | y| < 2.4 as a function of centrality, rapidity, and transverse momentum (pT) from pT= 3 GeV/c in the most forward region and up to 50GeV/c. Both prompt and nonprompt (coming from b hadron decays) J / ψ mesons are observed to be increasingly suppressed with centrality, with a magnitude similar to the one observed at sNN=2.76TeV for the two J / ψ meson components. No dependence on rapidity is observed for either prompt or nonprompt J / ψ mesons. An indication of a lower prompt J / ψ meson suppression at pT> 25 GeV/c is seen with respect to that observed at intermediate pT. The prompt ψ(2S) meson yield is found to be more suppressed than that of the prompt J / ψ mesons in the entire pT range."
"Safety and efficacy of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with end-stage renal disease: Meta-analysis  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: At the present, apixaban is the only nonvitamin K oral anticoagulant approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use with patients with creatinine clearance <15 mL/min or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, the recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data and there was lack of clinical trial evidence. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of apixaban in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or ESRD. Methods: Databases were searched through November 2017. Studies that reported incidence or odd ratios of bleeding complications or thromboembolic events in the use of apixaban in patients with CKD stage 4–5 or ESRD on dialysis were included. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Five studies were included into the analysis consisting of 43,850 patients in observational cohort studies. The majority of patients (87%) used apixaban for atrial fibrillation. The pooled estimated incidence of any bleeding complications on apixaban was 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.0%–23.0%). Compared to warfarin, apixaban was significantly associated with reduced risk of major bleeding (pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28–0.61). In studies in ESRD patients on dialysis, the pooled OR of major bleeding was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.07–0.95). There was no significant difference in risk of thromboembolic events in advanced CKD or ESRD patients on apixaban versus vitamin K antagonists (pooled OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.23–1.39). Conclusions: Among patients with advanced CKD and ESRD, the use of apixaban was associated with lower risk of major bleeding compared to warfarin, and was found to be relatively effective with no excess risk of thromboembolic events."
"Pattern of video game use in children with attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder and typical development  2018 Japan Pediatric SocietyBackground: Video game playing is a favorite leisure activity among children worldwide. Individuals with attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often lack self-control, making them at risk for substance abuse and game addiction. There are conflicting results, however, between studies on the pattern of video gaming and game addiction between those with ADHD and healthy controls. We therefore compared the pattern of video game use and game addiction between Thai children with ADHD and healthy controls. Methods: A total of 80 participants with ADHD (median age, 9.5 years) and 102 controls (median age, 10 years) were recruited in this study. ADHD was diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician. Each control subject's teacher completed the ADHD questionnaire to ensure that they did not have the diagnosis of ADHD. Pattern of video game use and Game Addiction Screening Test (GAST) were completed by participants’ parents. Results: More than half of the children with and without ADHD spent >2 h/day playing video games rather than engaging in other age-appropriate leisure activities, particularly on weekends. Participants with ADHD, however, had a higher rate of compulsive video game use than controls (37.5% vs 11.8%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although video game playing was relatively prevalent in children regardless of ADHD status, those with ADHD had a higher rate of problematic video game use than controls. The pattern of leisure activities including video game use should be assessed during health supervision visits. As such, those at risk for game addiction could be identified early, resulting in appropriate intervention."
"Greybody factor for black holes in dRGT massive gravity  2018, The Author(s).In general relativity, greybody factor is a quantity related to the quantum nature of a black hole. A high value of greybody factor indicates a high probability that Hawking radiation can reach infinity. Although general relativity is correct and has been successful in describing many phenomena, there are some questions that general relativity cannot answer. Therefore, general relativity is often modified to attain answers. One of the modifications is the ‘massive gravity’. The viable model of the massive gravity theory belongs to de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT). In this paper, we calculate the gravitational potential for the de Sitter black hole and for the dRGT black hole. We also derive the rigorous bound on the greybody factor for the de Sitter black hole and the dRGT black hole. It is found that the structure of potentials determines how much the rigorous bound on the greybody factor should be. That is, the higher the potential, the lesser the bound on the greybody factor will be. Moreover, we compare the greybody factor derived from the rigorous bound with the greybody factor derived from the matching technique. The result shows that the rigorous bound is a true lower bound because it is less than the greybody factor obtained from the matching technique."
"Sustainable dimension adaptation measure in green township assessment criteria  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Urbanized areas are typically the most significant sources of environmental degradation, thus, an urban assessment criteria tools aiming at equally adapted sustainability dimensions need to be firmly embedded in benchmarking planning and design framework and upon occupancy. The need for integral systematic rating is recognized in order to evaluate the performance of sustainable neighborhood and to promote sustainable urban development. In this study, Green Building Index Township Assessment Criteria (GBI-TAC) will be measure on holistic sustainable dimension pillar (SDP) adaptation in order to assess and redefine the current sustainability assessment criteria for future sustainable neighborhood development (SND). The objective of the research is to find-out whether the current GBI-TAC and its variables fulfilled the holistic SDP adaptations towards sustainable neighborhood development in Malaysia. The stakeholder-inclusion approached is used in this research in order to gather professional's stakeholders' opinions regarding the SDP adaptations for sustainable neighborhood development. The data were analysed using IBM SPSS AMOS22 Structural Equation Modelling. The findings suggested an adaptation gap of SDP in current GBI-TAC even though all core-criteria supported SDP adaptation, hence lead to further review and refinement for future Neighborhood Assessment Criteria in Malaysia."
"Search for single production of vector-like quarks decaying to a b quark and a Higgs boson  2018, The Author(s).A search is presented for single production of heavy vector-like quarks (B) that decay to a Higgs boson and a b quark, with the Higgs boson decaying to a highly boosted b b ¯ pair reconstructed as a single collimated jet. The analysis is based on data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The data are consistent with background expectations, and upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the B quark cross section and the branching fraction are obtained in the range 1.28–0.07 pb, for a narrow B quark with a mass between 700 and 1800 GeV. The production of B quarks with widths of 10, 20 and 30% of the resonance mass is also considered, and the sensitivities obtained are similar to those achieved in the narrow width case. This is the first search at the CERN LHC for the single production of a B quark through its fully hadronic decay channel, and the first study considering finite resonance widths of the B quark."
"Changes in free amino acid concentrations and associated gene expression profiles in the abdominal muscle of kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) acclimated at different salinities  2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Shrimps inhabiting coastalwaters can survive in a wide range of salinity. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in their acclimation to different environmental salinities have remained largely unknown. In the present study, we acclimated kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) at 1.7%, 3.4% and 4.0% salinities. After acclimating for 6, 12, 24 and 72 h, we determined free amino acid concentrations in their abdominal muscle, and performed RNA sequencing analysis on this muscle. The concentrations of free amino acids were clearly altered depending on salinity after 24 h of acclimation. Glutamine and alanine concentrations were markedly increased following the increase of salinity. In associationwith such changes,many genes related to amino acid metabolism changed their expression levels. In particular, the increase of the expression level of the gene encoding glutamateammonia ligase, which functions in glutaminemetabolism, appeared to be associated with the increased glutamine concentration at high salinity. Furthermore, the increased alanine concentration at high salinity was likely associated with the decrease in the expression levels of the the gene encoding alanine-glyoxylate transaminase. Thus, there is a possibility that changes in the concentration of free amino acids for osmoregulation in kuruma shrimp are regulated by changes in the expression levels of genes related to amino acid metabolism."
"Arsenic, manganese, and cyanide removal in a tailing storage facility for a gold mine using phytoremediation 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.In this study, six selected plants (Acacia mangium, A. auriculiformis, Leucaena leucocepphala, bamboo, Pennisetum purpureum, and Vetiveria zizanioides) were cultivated in a mine tailing storage facility in a gold mine area. P. purpureum, a monocot species, provided the highest phytoremediation efficiency. Therefore, it is a potentially appropriate plant for site remediation. It is interesting that P. purpureum is perennial, meaning it can be easily planted and requires less effort and input for care with the ability to flourish year round. Thus, this study recommends using P. purpureum for phytoremediation of heavy metals and cyanide in gold mine areas."
"Notch signaling regulates the responses of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages in the presence of immune complexes  2018 Wongchana et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Macrophages exhibit diverse effector phenotypes depending on the stimuli and their micro-environment. Classically activated macrophages are primed with interferon (IFN)γ and stimulated with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. They produce inflammatory mediators and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12. In the presence of immune complexes (ICs), activated macrophages have decreased IL-12 production and increased IL-10 production and presumably act as regulatory macrophages. Notch signaling has been shown to regulate the effector functions of classically activated macrophages. In this study, we investigated whether Notch signaling is active in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages in the presence of ICs. LPS/IC stimulation increased the level of cleaved Notch1 in murine macrophages, while IC stimulation alone did not. Delta-like 4, but not Jagged1, was responsible for generating cleaved Notch1. The activation of Notch signaling by LPS/ICs depended upon NF-κB and MEK/Erk pathway activation. Macrophages with the targeted deletion of Rbpj, which encodes a DNA-binding protein central to canonical Notch signaling, produced significantly less IL-10 upon LPS/IC stimulation. A similar impact on IL-10 production was observed when Notch signaling was inhibited with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI). Defects in NF-κB p50 nuclear localization were observed in GSI-treated macrophages and in Rbpj-/- macrophages, suggesting cross-regulation between the Notch and NF-κB pathways. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Notch signaling regulates the transcription of genes involved in the cell cycle, macrophage activation, leukocyte migration and cytokine production in LPS/IC-stimulated macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that the Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating the functions of macrophages activated by LPS and ICs."
"Measurement of b hadron lifetimes in pp collisions at √s=8TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.Measurements are presented of the lifetimes of the B 0, Bs0, Λb0, and Bc+ hadrons using the decay channels B0→J/ψK∗(892)0, B0→J/ψKS0, Bs0→J/ψπ+π-, Bs0→J/ψϕ(1020), Λb0→J/ψΛ0, and Bc+→J/ψπ+. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7fb-1, was collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in proton–proton collisions at s=8TeV. The B 0 lifetime is measured to be 453.0±1.6(stat)±1.8(syst)μm in J / ψK ∗(892) 0and 457.8±2.7(stat)±2.8(syst)μm in J/ψKS0, which results in a combined measurement of cτB0=454.1±1.4(stat)±1.7(syst)μm. The effective lifetime of the Bs0 meson is measured in two decay modes, with contributions from different amounts of the heavy and light eigenstates. This results in two different measured lifetimes: cτBs0→J/ψπ+π-=502.7±10.2(stat)±3.4(syst)μm and cτBs0→J/ψϕ(1020)=443.9±2.0(stat)±1.5(syst)μm. The Λb0 lifetime is found to be 442.9±8.2(stat)±2.8(syst)μm. The precision from each of these channels is as good as or better than previous measurements. The Bc+ lifetime, measured with respect to the B + to reduce the systematic uncertainty, is 162.3±7.8(stat)±4.2(syst)±0.1(τB+)μm. All results are in agreement with current world-average values."
"Search for dark matter in events with energetic, hadronically decaying top quarks and missing transverse momentum at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for dark matter is conducted in events with large missing transverse momentum and a hadronically decaying, Lorentz-boosted top quark. This study is performed using proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, in data recorded by the CMS detector in 2016 at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb−1. New substructure techniques, including the novel use of energy correlation functions, are utilized to identify the decay products of the top quark. With no significant deviations observed from predictions of the standard model, limits are placed on the production of new heavy bosons coupling to dark matter particles. For a scenario with purely vector-like or purely axial-vector-like flavor changing neutral currents, mediator masses between 0.20 and 1.75 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, given a sufficiently small dark matter mass. Scalar resonances decaying into a top quark and a dark matter fermion are excluded for masses below 3.4 TeV, assuming a dark matter mass of 100 GeV.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."

"Molecular Evidence of Rickettsia in Human and Dog Blood in Bangkok  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Rickettsia spp. has been detected in dog fleas in Bangkok, Thailand. With the intent of collecting evidence to confirm the presence of rickettsioses in dogs and to assess the level of associated potential for accidental human infection, human buffy coat from patients with fever of unknown origin (n = 168), whole blood samples from dogs (n = 353), and 19 flea groups from our dog sample population were studied during the 2012 to 2014 study period. The presence of Rickettsia was investigated by molecular detection of 23S rRNA gene of Rickettsia genus, citrate synthase (gltA) gene, and 17-kDa outer membrane gene. All positive samples were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Using phylogenetic analysis, three groups of Rickettsia were detected, as follows: Rickettsia felis in 8 patients and 8 dogs; R. felis-like sp. in 2 patients, 5 dogs, and 11 flea samples; and Rickettsia typhi in 3 patients. In addition to confirming the presence of R. felis in Thai patients, the findings of this study suggest that R. felis-like sp. isolated from fleas that were symbiotically coexisting with dogs that we evaluated in this study can transmit and cause disease in dogs and humans in Bangkok."
"Development of ultra-short PCR assay to reveal BRAF V600 mutation status in Thai colorectal cancer tissues  2018 Chat-Uthai et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The protein kinase BRAF is one of the key players in regulating cellular responses to extracellular signals. Somatic mutations of the BRAF gene, causing constitutive activation of BRAF, have been found in various types of human cancers such as malignant melanoma, and colorectal cancer. BRAF V600E and V600K, most commonly observed mutations in these cancers, may predict response to targeted therapies. Many techniques suffer from a lack of diagnostic sensitivity in mutation analysis in clinical samples with a low cancer cell percentage or poor-quality fragmented DNA. Here we present allele-specific real-time PCR assay for amplifying 35- to 45-base target sequences in BRAF gene. Forward primer designed for BRAF V600E detection is capable of recognizing both types of BRAF V600E mutation, i.e. V600E1 (c.1799T>;A) and V600E2 (c.1799_1800delTGinsAA), as well as complex tandem mutation caused by nucleotide changes in codons 600 and 601. We utilized this assay to analyze Thai formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Forty-eight percent of 178 Thai colorectal cancer tissues has KRAS mutation detected by highly sensitive commercial assays. Although these DNA samples contain low overall yield of amplifiable DNA, our newly-developed assay successfully revealed BRAF V600 mutations in 6 of 93 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer tissues which KRAS mutation was not detected. Ultra-short PCR assay with forward mutation-specific primers is potentially useful to detect BRAF V600 mutations in highly fragmented DNA specimens from cancer patients."
"Search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson to μτ and eτ in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson in the μτ and eτ decay modes is presented. The search is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector in 2016, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess over the standard model expectation is observed. The observed (expected) upper limits on the lepton flavour violating branching fractions of the Higgs boson are ℬ(H → μτ) < 0.25% (0.25%) and ℬ(H → eτ) < 0.61% (0.37%), at 95% confidence level. These results are used to derive upper limits on the off-diagonal μτ and eτ Yukawa couplings |Yμτ|2+|Yτμ|2<1.43×10−3 and |Yeτ|2+|Yτe|2<2.26×10−3 at 95% confidence level. The limits on the lepton flavour violating branching fractions of the Higgs boson and on the associated Yukawa couplings are the most stringent to date.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Insight into the substrate specificity change caused by the Y227H mutation of α-glucosidase III from the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) through molecular dynamics simulations  2018 Na Ayutthaya et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Honey from the European honeybee, Apis mellifera, is produced by α-glucosidases (HBGases) and is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Categorized by their substrate specificities, HBGases have three isoforms: HBGase I, II and III. Previous experimental investigations showed that wild-type HBGase III from Apis mellifera (WT) preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while the Y227H mutant (MT) preferred maltose to sucrose. This mutant can potentially be used for malt hydrolysis because it can efficiently hydrolyze maltose. In this work, to elucidate important factors contributing to substrate specificity of this enzyme and gain insight into how the Y227H mutation causes substrate specificity change, WT and MT homology models were constructed, and sucrose/ maltose was docked into active sites of the WT and MT. AMBER14 was employed to perform three independent molecular dynamics runs for these four complexes. Based on the relative binding free energies calculated by the MM-GBSA method, sucrose is better than maltose for WT binding, while maltose is better than sucrose for MT binding. These rankings support the experimentally observed substrate specificity that WT preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while MT preferred maltose to sucrose, suggesting the importance of binding affinity for substrate specificity. We also found that the Y227H mutation caused changes in the proximities between the atoms necessary for sucrose/maltose hydrolysis that may affect enzyme efficiency in the hydrolysis of sucrose/maltose. Moreover, the per-residue binding free energy decomposition results show that Y227/H227 may be a key residue for preference binding of sucrose/maltose in the WT/MT active site. Our study provides important and novel insight into the binding of sucrose/maltose in the active site of Apis mellifera HBGase III and into how the Y227H mutation leads to the substrate specificity change at the molecular level. This knowledge could be beneficial in the design of this enzyme for increased production of desired products."
"Chitosan-adjuvanted Mycoplasma gallisepticum bacterin via intraocular administration enhances Mycoplasma gallisepticum protection in commercial layers  2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) causes respiratory signs and economic losses in the poultry industry. MG vaccination is one of the effective prevention and control measures that have been used around the world. Our previous study demonstrated that chitosan-adjuvanted MG bacterin could effectively reduce pathological lesions induced by MG and that chitosan could be used as an adjuvant in MG bacterin. The present study determining the efficacy of MG bacterins against the Thai MG strain was based on vaccine programs. Seven groups (25 layers/group) were received MG bacterins containing 0.5% chitosan or a commercial bacterin via intramuscular (IM) or intraocular (IO) route at 6 and 10 wk of age. Sham-negative and sham-positive controls were groups 1 and 2, respectively. Group 3: IM route of chitosan bacterin followed by IM route of chitosan bacterin; group 4: commercial bacterin via IM route followed by chitosan bacterin via IO route; group 5: commercial bacterin via IM route followed by commercial bacterin via IM route; group 6: chitosan bacterin via IM followed by chitosan bacterin via IO route; and group 7: chitosan bacterin via IO route followed by chitosan bacterin via IO route were determined. At 16 wk of age, all groups, excluding group 1, were challenged intratracheally with 0.1 mL containing Thai MG strain 10 7 colony-forming unit. At 17, 18, and 20 wk of age, 5 birds in each group were bled for serological testing and swabbed at the choanal cleft for the quantitative real-time PCR assay, the euthanized and necropsied. The results showed that birds vaccinated with a commercial intramuscular bacterin followed by an intraocularly chitosan adjuvant bacterin showed the best protection against the MG challenge. The study indicated that chitosan could be the effective mucosal adjuvant and increased the effectiveness of MG bacterin."
"Public health significance of companion animals in emergence and re-emergence of bacterial zoonoses  2018 Network for the Veterinarians of Bangladesh.Companion animals especially cats and dogs can provide a bridge for transmission of emerging bacterial diseases that are zoonotic in nature. Zoonotic diseases had posed numerous risk to ownership of companion animals by human either through directed or indirect contact especially in recent years where livestock species are being used as pets. Furthermore, companion animals could play a significant role in zoonosis as a potential reservoirs of various infections. These diseases have impacted greatly to the definition of new paradigms posed by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases particularly relating to biosecurity policies and broadly to the protection of public health. Multi-sectorial collaboration for disease containment should be emphasized towards curtailing and managing health risks regarding infectious zoonotic diseases."
"Enterotoxin gene profile of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from dogs, humans and the environment  2018 The Authors.Purpose. This study aimed to detect and identify staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains from different sources, and to investigate the relationship between their sequence types (STs) and SE gene patterns. Methodology. The profiles of 17 SE genes in 93 MRSP strains isolated from dogs (n=43), humans (n=18) and the environment (n=32) were detected by PCR. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), SCCmec typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used to analyse the clonal relatedness between the molecular type and SE gene profiles. Results/Key findings. The human MRSP strains harboured the greatest number of SE genes (12/17; sea, sec, seg, sei, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, sep, seq and tst-1) compared to those from dogs (5/17; sec, sel, sem, seq and tst-1) and environmental sources (3/17; sec, seq and tst-1). Using MLST and PFGE, different SE gene profiles were found within the same clonal type. Conclusion. We show that isolates of MRSP vary in their virulence gene profiles, depending on the source from which they have been isolated. This insight should encourage the development of appropriate monitoring and mitigation strategies to reduce the transmission of MRSP in veterinary hospitals and households."
"Prevalence of Antibody against Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor (AT1R) Among Thai Kidney Transplant Patients  2018 Elsevier Inc.Background: Non-HLA antibodies specific to angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R-Ab) are associated with antibody-mediated rejection after kidney transplantation. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of AT1R-Ab among pre-transplantation Thai patients and to compare the association of patient demographics with AT1R-Ab levels. Methods: This cohort study enrolled nonsensitized kidney transplant patients with negative panel reactive antibodies at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. AT1R-Ab level was measured with the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit in all pre-transplantation serum samples with the use of a cutoff of >17.0 U/mL to distinguish AT1R-Ab+ from AT1R-Ab at risk and AT1R-Ab− groups. Results: In all, 70 patients were enrolled with a mean age of 45 (range, 17–68) years, of which 52 were male. Six patients (8.6%) were positive for AT1R-Ab (>17.0 U/mL). The mean age in the AT1R-Ab+ group was lower than in the AT1R-Ab at risk and AT1R-Ab− groups (P =.06). Moreover, the AT1R-Ab+ group had significantly more patients ≤30 years of age (P =.01). No differences were found regarding sex, body mass index, transplant characteristics, causes of end-stage renal disease, or kidney biopsy diagnosis. Conclusions: This study is the first to report the prevalence of AT1R-Ab among Thai kidney transplant patients. Further studies are suggested for the application of AT1R-Ab detection for routine testing."
"A Tale of Two Hybrid Regimes: A Study of Cabinets and Parliaments in Indonesia and Thailand Copyright  Cambridge University Press 2018.This article applies the concept of hybrid regimes to evaluate the state of political transition in Indonesia and Thailand. It aims to answer why the transition to democracy in Indonesia during 1999-2004 was successful, while the transition in Thailand during 1997-2006 culminated in a reversion to authoritarianism by examining the social profiles and formation of cabinet and parliament members as well as the design of constitutions. The study suggests that the lack of inclusiveness helps explain why democratization in Thailand was in failure. During the transition period, inclusiveness has not markedly increased because of the leadership strongman style, the flaws in the recruitment process, and the problem with the party system. This was unlike Indonesia, where cabinet, parliament, and multiparty system were able to include a variety groups and broad societal segments that played a significant role in deliberating political rules of the game. Indonesia's institutional rearrangements appear to sustain popular participation and engender momentum for fostering democracy, while Thailand's constitutional re-engineering contains many provisions to disempower the elected bodies. The perpetuation of the hybrid regime in Thailand is foreseeable as the hybridity satisfies the needs and concerns of the traditional elites and the urban middle class."
"Encapsulation of the reductase component of p-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase in poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles by three different emulsification techniques  The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.p-Hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase component 1 (C1) is a useful enzyme for generating reduced flavin and NAD+ intermediates. In this study, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) were used to encapsulate the C1 (PLGA-C1 NPs). Enzymatic activity, stability, and reusability of PLGA-C1 NPs prepared using three different methods [oil in water (o/w), water in oil in water (w/o/w), and solid in oil in water (s/o/w)] were compared. The s/o/w provided the optimal conditions for encapsulation of C1(PLGA-C1,s NPs), giving the highest enzyme activity, stability, and reusability. The s/o/w method improves enzyme activity ∼11 and 9-fold compared to w/o/w (PLGA-C1,w NPs) and o/w (PLGA-C1,o NPs). In addition, s/o/w prepared PLGA-C1,s NPs could be reused 14 times with nearly 50% activity remaining, a much higher reusability compared to PLGA-C1,o NPs and PLGA-C1,w NPs. These nanovesicles were successfully utilised to generate reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and supply this cofactor to a hydroxylase enzyme that has application for synthesising anti-inflammatory compounds. Therefore, this recycling biocatalyst prepared using the s/o/w method is effective and has the potential for use in combination with other enzymes that require reduced FMN. Application of PLGA-C1,s NPs may be possible in additional biocatalytic processes for chemical or biochemical production."
"Feminising the workforce in ageing East Asia? The potential of skilled female labour in four advanced economies  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The populations of Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore are ageing rapidly, triggering fears of labour shortages. In spite of the widely acknowledged importance of worker’s skill levels, traditional labour supply projections do not account for ongoing changes in populations’ education composition and educational differentials in economic activity. By focusing on the role of educational expansion in general and female labour potential in particular, this study analyses past trends and projects future labour supply in four advanced Asian economies. We first offer an in-depth overview of developments of labour force participation, emphasising each country-specific context. We then provide selected scenarios of labour force projections up to 2050 which consider changing population compositions by education and differentials in labour participation patterns. We find that due to continued improvements in education, post-secondary educated workers will make up at least two-thirds of the future labour force in each economy. If female labour force participation saw increases in line with the assumptions of our benchmark scenario, the share of post-secondary educated women could exceed 30% of the entire workforce by 2050. Hence, the pressing problem of labour shrinkage could partly be offset by particularly incorporating better-educated women. Our findings underscore the effects of different participation scenarios (especially of women) on the total size of the labour force and the importance of including the education dimension in considerations about future labour supply. While we are not the first to make the latter argument, we are the first to quantify this potential for the analysed four advanced Asian economies."
"The Performance of Controlled Low-strength Material Base Supporting a High-volume Asphalt Pavement  2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.A lack of proper base and subbase materials in pavement construction is one of the common problems in the tropical region worldwide. In many countries such as Thailand, cementitious materials are usually used for ground improvement. Controlled Lowstrength Material (CLSM) was considered in this study as a pavement base material. The CLSM mixes were prepared by varying cement, fly ash and fine aggregate content. Each mixed component was studied for their physical and chemical properties. After mixing, properties of the CLSM were investigated based on the standard testing of fresh concrete and cement-treated base material. The flowability, setting time and bleeding were checked to ensure that the CLSM were self-compacting. The mechanical properties of hardened CLSM were determined by means of CBR, unconfined compressive strength and resilient modulus tests. The resilient modulus results were used in the analytical design of flexible pavement with CLSM base. The critical traffic data under high-volume road collected by the Thailand Department of Highway was adopted in this study. Results show that the CLSM base considerably increased the performance as well as design life of asphalt pavement compared with the conventional crush rock base pavement."
"Survey of laboratory practices for diagnosis of fungal infection in seven Asian countries: An Asia Fungal Working Group (AFWG) initiative  2018 The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.An online survey of mycology laboratories in seven Asian countries was conducted to assess the status, competence, and services available. Country representatives from the Asia Fungal Working Group (AFWG) contacted as many laboratories performing mycology diagnosis as possible in their respective countries, requesting that the laboratory heads complete the online survey. In total, 241 laboratories responded, including 71 in China, 104 in India, 11 in Indonesia, 26 in the Philippines, four in Singapore, 18 in Taiwan, and seven in Thailand. Overall, 129/241 (53.5%) surveyed mycology laboratories operate as separate designated mycology laboratories, 75/241 (31.1%) conduct regular formal staff training, 103/241 (42.7%) are accredited, and 88/157 (56.1%) participate in external quality assurance scheme (EQAS) programs. Microscopy and culture methods are available in nearly all laboratories, although few perform DNA sequencing (37/219; 16.9%) or use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) (27/219; 12.3%) for isolate identification. Antifungal susceptibility testing is performed in 142/241 (58.9%) laboratories, mainly for yeasts. The most commonly performed nonculture diagnostic is cryptococcal antigen testing (66 laboratories), followed by galactomannan testing (55), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis (37), and beta-D-glucan testing (24). Therapeutic drug monitoring is conducted in 21 laboratories. There is almost no access to advanced diagnostic tests, like galactomannan, β-D-glucan, and PCR, in the surveyed laboratories in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. These results highlight the need for development of quality laboratories, accreditation and training of manpower in existing laboratories, and access to advanced non-culture-based diagnostic tests to facilitate the diagnosis of fungal infections in Asia."
"Modelling and electrical characteristics of the Thailand plasma focus-II (TPF-II)  2018, Walailak University. All rights reserved.The Thailand Plasma Focus II (TPF-II) is a 3.3 kJ dense plasma focus that was developed at Walailak University, Thailand. The aim of the device is to study the production of ion beams in the keV energy range and their applications for the color modification of gemstones. A high-energy ion beam is produced by heating and acceleration in the pinch phase of the plasma focus. The heating process is determined by the maximum electrical current, which can be optimized by variation of the system’s inductance. Lee model code was implemented to optimize the configuration of the electrodes. The current waveforms for the different initial conditions were used to obtain the system’s inductance, which was verified by a short circuit test. It was found that the inductance and resistance were about 153 nH and 12 mΩ, respectively."
"Low cost and easy rice husk modification to efficiently enhance ammonium and nitrate adsorption  2018, The Author(s).Purpose: This research aimed to study the adsorption of ammonium and nitrate by simply modifying the surface of the rice husk using slow pyrolysis and surfactants modification. Methods: Rice husk biochar was prepared by slowly pyrolyzing at 500 °C, 2 h. The rice husk and its biochar were modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate. FTIR, BET and zeta potential measurements were used to characterize the obtained adsorbents. Results: Slow pyrolysis increased the specific surface area and decreased the surface charge of rice husk while surfactant clogged the pore but could change the charge of a surface. Adsorption of both ammonium and nitrate on rice husk, its biochar, and their modification with surfactants fitted Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, indicating heterogeneity in adsorption. Slow pyrolysis gave the highest ammonium removal with maximum adsorption capacity of 44 mgN/g and it was a physical process. The cetyltrimethylammonium bromide modification gave a significant nitrate removal on both rice husk and its biochar with maximum adsorption of 278 and 213 mgN/g, respectively, which is higher than a commercial adsorbent. Conclusions: These two modification techniques gave great adsorption enhancement with cost-effectiveness as compared to other reviewed methods which could use as a nitrogen-rich fertilizer and fertilizer retainment in crop production."
"Preparations for Old Age and Well-Being in Later Life in Thailand: Gender Matters?  2016,  The Author(s) 2016.Data from the 2011 Survey of Older Persons in Thailand examines the association between preparations for old age (financial, health, caregiving, living arrangements, and spiritual) and three measures of well-being: financial satisfaction, life satisfaction, and physical health. The study further explores the role of social stratification and the gendered nature of these relationships. The sample (N = 10,235) is restricted to adults 60 years and above, who are retired and answered the survey independently. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicate that different forms of preparation are positively associated with post-retirement well-being for men and women but socioeconomic resources are positively associated with all three well-being outcomes. Furthermore, for women, there are significant negative interaction effects of income and financial preparation on life satisfaction, as well as negative interaction effects of disability and caregiver preparation on self-rated health. Implications for long-term care, socioeconomic inequality, and gender inequality in paid labor are discussed."
"Clinicopathological features and outcomes of pythiosis  2018 The Author(s)Objectives: Vascular pythiosis is a life-threatening infection caused by the oomycete Pythium insidiosum. This article reports the clinical presentation, serodiagnosis, pathology, and outcomes seen at the authors’ institution. Methods: The cases of patients with proven vascular pythiosis at Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand from January 2006 to December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Thirteen patients were analyzed, eight of whom had underlying thalassemias. Of the remaining five patients, one had aplastic anemia, one had myelodysplasia, one had acute leukemia, one had cirrhosis, and one had alcoholism. Neutropenic patients showed a rapid clinical deterioration. Atypical presentations including carotid arteritis, aneurysm, brain abscess, and stroke occurred in the non-thalassemic patients. Serology yielded positive results in all cases, with a rapid turnaround time. Serology has the advantage of providing a presurgical diagnosis, which allows prompt surgery and clinical cure to be achieved. Pathology revealed a neutrophilic response in the acute phase and a later shift to granuloma. Immunotherapy in combination with itraconazole and terbinafine was given. The amputation rate was 77%, and disease-free surgical margins were achieved in five cases (38%). The mortality rate was 31%. Conclusions: This study highlights new aspects of pythiosis, such as the unusual host, clinical presentation, serology as a marker for rapid diagnosis, histopathology, and outcomes. Early recognition of the disease with prompt multimodality treatment may improve survival."
"Oral diseases associated with condition-specific oral health-related quality of life and school performance of Thai primary school children: A hierarchical approach  2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjectives: To assess the hierarchical associations between children's school performance and condition-specific (CS) oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), school absence, oral status, sociodemographic and economic status (SDES) and social capital; and to investigate the associations between CS OHRQoL and related oral status, adjusting for SDES and social capital. Methods: Data on 925 sixth grade children in Sakaeo province, Thailand, were collected through oral examinations for dental caries and oral hygiene, social capital questionnaires, OHRQoL interviews using the Child-Oral Impacts on Daily Performances index, parental self-administered questionnaires and school documents. A hierarchical conceptual framework was developed, and independent variables were hierarchically entered into multiple logistic models for CS OHRQoL and linear regression models for school performance. Results: After adjusting for SDES and social capital, children with high DMFT or DT scores were significantly threefold more likely to have CS impacts attributed to dental caries. However, poor oral hygiene was not significantly associated with CS impacts attributed to gingival disease. High DMFT scores were significantly associated with lower school performance, whereas high Simplified Oral Hygiene Index scores were not. The final model showed that CS impacts attributed to dental caries and school absence accounted for the association between DMFT score and school performance. Conclusions: Dental caries was associated with CS impacts on OHRQoL, and exerted its effect on school performance through the CS impacts and school absence. There was no association between oral hygiene and CS impacts on OHRQoL or school performance."
"Captive breeding reveals larval performance and adult body size differences between two geographical populations of the stag beetle Aegus chelifer chelifer (Coleoptera: Lucanidae)  2018Stag beetles usually have great intraspecific variation in their body sizes, which can be affected by both environmental and genetic factors. However, direct studies on wild-caught specimens may be insufficient to clarify such variation due to the confounding effects of ecological variance in natural habitats. To evaluate this, the stag beetle Aegus chelifer chelifer MacLeay, 1819 was collected from within two localities (Bangkok metropolitan area and Chanthaburi province) in Thailand and then reared under the same condition to investigate the differences in morphological characteristics between the wild-caught and captive-bred beetles and between the two geographical populations. Narrow-sense heritabilities (h2) of the observed traits in adults were not significant. Variation in the body size of captive-bred specimens was less than in the wild-caught specimens and the overlap of the body size variation between the two populations was lower in the captive-bred beetles. The Chanthaburi population had a significantly larger body size than the Bangkok population. Allometric slopes and intercepts were also significantly different between the two geographic populations. Captive-bred larvae showed similar relative growth rates, but male larvae from the Chanthaburi population had a longer feeding period, and so a larger adult body size, than those from the Bangkok population. The differences between the two populations could be explained by adaptation through larval performances and body size in order to respond to their habitats."
"PCR-reverse dot blot of the nucleotide signature sequences of matK for the identification of Mitragyna speciosa, a narcotic species  2018 The AuthorsFour species of Mitragyna plants exist in Thailand, including Mitragyna speciosa, M. rotundifolia, M. hirsuta, and M. diversifolia. M. speciosa, or “Kratom” in Thai, is the only narcotic species that has been prohibited by law in Thailand. It causes addiction and sometimes fatalities when overdosed. The accurate detection of this species is needed in forensic justice for legal proceedings. In this study, we aim to develop an assay based on DNA barcoding for the detection of M. speciosa in forensic specimens. DNA barcodes of the matK, rbcL, psbA-trnH and ITS2 regions of the four Mitragyna species were established. The matK nucleotide signature site was selected as a target for the discrimination of M. speciosa, a narcotic species, from non-narcotics by using PCR-reverse dot blot (RDB) hybridization assay. This RDB assay is highly specific and selective for M. speciosa, costs little and is easily performed without advanced analytical equipment. This method is an alternative to DNA sequencing for the detection of M. speciosa in suspected samples. Using PCR-RDB to detect the polymorphisms of matK holds promise as a routine method to test for the presence of M. speciosa in forensic specimens."
"Development and psychometrics of a short-form pharmaceutical care-specific measure for quality of life  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.Background The validated patient-reported outcomes measure of pharmaceutical therapy for quality of life (PROMPT-QoL) contains 43-items, and can be too lengthy for some applications. Objectives To develop a brief version called the PROMPT, and test its psychometric properties. Setting Four public hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand. Method Secondary analysis of three databases used to develop and evaluate the original PROMPT-QoL. Items for the short-form PROMPT were selected based on expert and patient evaluations of content and importance, and lack of redundancy. All domains of the original version are represented in the PROMPT. Main outcome measures Psychometric properties (internal consistency and test–retest reliability, criterion, convergent and discriminant validity, and responsiveness), and indicators of practicality (e.g., administration time, missing data). Results Analyses of the PROMPT and its domain subscales demonstrated good internal consistency and fair-to-excellent test–retest reliability. Correlations between the original and short-form, overall and by domain, were high. Expectations for convergent and discriminant validity were met as correlations between the PROMPT and generic health-related quality of life measures (WHOQoL-BREF domains and summary scores of the SF-12v2) were modest (< 0.40). Based on data from a trial of pharmaceutical care, the PROMPT short-form was very responsive to reductions in medication related problems. Administration time for the PROMPT is estimated to be about 5 min, and across all datasets used, no missing data were found amongst the 16 items of the PROMPT. Conclusion The 16-item PROMPT appears to be a practical, reliable, valid, and responsive instrument to identify patient’s drug-related needs and to assess the humanistic impact of patient-centered pharmaceutical care."
"Irradiation provided by dental radiological procedures in a pediatric population  2018 Elsevier B.V.Background: Children are more sensitive to ionizing radiation effects due to their high radiosensitivity. Purpose: To estimate doses and risks for dental radiological examinations in children. Material and methods: A pediatric population consisting of 7150 children and young adults which underwent 12252 dental radiological examinations (4220 intraoral, 1324 cephalometric, 5284 panoramic radiographs and 1424 CBCTs) within two years were included. Two groups were studied: CBCT group (exposed to CBCT ± conventional radiographs) and 2D group (exposed only to 2D radiological examinations). The effective doses were corrected according to age at exposure and settings parameters (mA;FOV) by using logarithmic fit equations for dose interpolation. The individual cumulative dose, per-caput collective dose and radiation risk were calculated for each group. Results: The median effective and cumulative doses for conventional radiographs were lower than 20 μSv and did not vary with age. Children exposed to CBCT had a higher median effective dose (127.2 μSv) and cumulative dose (156.5 μSv) with a significant increased cumulative dose between 11 and 14 years. The CBCT contributed with 70% to the collective dose and per caput collective dose was 184 μSv for CBCT exposures. The Life Attributable Risk (LAR) and Relative Radiation Level (RRL) were significantly higher for children exposed to CBCT under the age of 18. The highest radiation dose for CBCT was equivalent with 34.1 days of natural background radiation and it was found for ages between 11 and 15. Conclusion: The CBCT doses and radiation risk vary but remain in the lower levels of the relative risk of medical exposures."
"Topical drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye: Dexamethasone concentrations in various eye tissues after topical administration for up to 15 days to rabbits  2018 Elsevier B.V.Delivering drug to the back of the eye remains a challenging task owning to the anatomical and physiological barrier of the eye. Today injection and implants are routinely used to treat diseases in the posterior segment of the eye. Both methods require repeated injection or insertion with potential complication such as retinal detachment, endophtalmitis and retinal haemorrhage, a better non-invasive approach is therefore needed. The aim of this study was to investigate if topically applied dexamethasone in cyclodextrin micro-suspension could deliver dexamethasone to the posterior segment of the eye in therapeutic concentrations in rabbits. Un-anesthetized pigmented rabbits were used in this study where they received eye drop in the left eye and were sacrificed 1, 2, 6 h after administration, and 7 and 15 days after receiving eye drop to the left eye 3 times a day. The result showed that dexamethasone was detectable in all ophthalmic tissues tested and at relatively high concentrations in tissues at the back of the eye. Furthermore, dexamethasone did not accumulate in the ocular tissues after multiple daily dosing for up to 15 days. This novel delivery technique could therefore be used to deliver lipophilic drug to the posterior segment of the eye."
"An assessment of the longevity of samarium cobalt trioxide perovskite catalyst during the conversion of greenhouse gases into syngas  2018 Elsevier LtdCatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reforming of methane (CH4) has gained interest because it reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in the environment. In addition, the products from the reforming process are utilized as feedstock in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. However, rapid catalyst deactivation and sintering due to carbon deposition often accompany the CO2 reforming of CH4 reaction. In this study, samarium cobalt trioxides perovskite catalyst was synthesized and employed as catalyst in a 72 h longevity test conducted at 1073 K using CO2 to reform CH4 with gas-hourly-space velocity of 30,000 h−1. Feed ratios (0.5–2.0) were varied and excellent catalytic longevity, maximum conversion (above 90%) and yield (above 60%), were obtained at 1.0 feed ratio. Physicochemical properties of the fresh catalyst revealed uniform metallic particles distribution on a single phase perovskite structure, while spent catalyst showed evidence of carbon which was graphitic at 0.5–1.33 feed ratio with C–C and C–H bonds, and formed contaminant of carbon at 2.0 feed ratio with O–C[dbnd]O bond."
"miR-302a-3p regulates RANKL expression in human mandibular osteoblast-like cells  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) is important substance during osteoclastogenesis that resulted in alveolar bone loss of periodontitis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression in several biological processes including osteoclastogenesis. We investigated the function of microRNA-302a-3p (miR-302a-3p) to regulate receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) expression in human mandibular osteoblast-like cells (HMOBs). HMOBs were incubated with prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) to mimic inflammation, or with PGE 2 and interferon gamma (IFNγ) to mimic homeostasis. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiles related to RANKL expression were demonstrated by PCR array, and miR-302a-3p was identified. Using TargetScanHuman 7.0, a target of miR-302a-3p was predicted. To confirm its function, miR-302a-3p was overexpressed, or silenced, by transfection with miR-302a-3p mimic, or inhibitor, respectively. Level of miR-302a-3p and RANKL mRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR. Soluble RANKL (sRANKL), and membrane-bound RANKL (mRANKL) were measured by ELISA and by Western blot, respectively. When PGE 2 stimulated RANKL in HMOBs, miR-302a-3p was lower than baseline level. However, upregulation of miR-302a-3p is observed when IFNγ suppressed RANKL expression in PGE 2 -stimulated HMOBs. miR-302a-3p was predicted to target PRKACB mRNA encoding the catalytic subunit in cAMP/PKA pathway. Overexpression of miR-302a-3p could decrease RANKL expression during PGE 2 stimulation. In contrast, silencing of miR-302a-3p by its inhibitor increased RANKL expression in PGE 2 -IFNγ conditioned HMOBs. miR-302a-3p regulates RANKL expression in HMOBs within PGE 2 -IFNγ regulatory network."
"Relaxation Effect on Intrapore Diffusivities of Highly Charged Colloidal Particles Confined in Porous Membranes  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.During the particle intrapore diffusion, the particle–pore hydrodynamic interaction enhances the drag on the particle, resulting in a particle diffusivity reduction. For charged particles submerged in an electrolytic solution, the distortion of electrical double layer caused by particle motion creates an additional drag: a phenomenon known as the relaxation effect. Such effect on intrapore diffusivities of rigid spherical particles confined in long cylindrical pores is determined by employing a perturbation scheme involving particle Peclet number. Comparison between present simulation results and previous results from perturbations involving both particle Peclet number and surface charge density indicates that the perturbation involving surface charge density overestimates the electrokinetic retardation. Our results demonstrate that, whereas a particle surface charge density increase always amplifies the excess drag due to relaxation, effects of pore surface charge density are more complicated and dependent on values of particle surface charge density and Debye length. If a highly charged particle is confined in a charged pore, this additional drag increases as a function of Debye length if the Debye length is small, but becomes constant despite the increasing Debye length if the Debye length is comparable or larger than the pore radius. For particles confined in uncharged pores, however, the Debye length increase always amplifies the electrokinetic retardation, causing the particle diffusivity reduction of a highly charged particle in an uncharged pore to be larger than that of a similar particle confined in a charged pore if the Debye length is comparable to or larger than the pore radius."
"Age estimation methods using hand and wrist radiographs in a group of contemporary Thais  2018 Elsevier B.V.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of three commonly used age estimation methods in Thailand: Greulich–Pyle, Tanner–Whitehouse and Fishman. Materials and methods: Three hundred and sixty-five hand and wrist radiographs of 8–20 years old Thai patients were retrospectively collected. The radiographs were taken between 2011–2016. Greulich–Pyle, Tanner–Whitehouse 3 radius, ulna and selected short bones (RUS), and Fishman method were applied for each radiograph. Comparisons between the estimated age from each method and the chronological age were done using Wilcoxon signed ranks test with Bonferroni correction. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy tests were performed on the important legal age thresholds in Thailand (10, 13, 15 and 18 years old). Intra- and inter-observer reliability were evaluated by weighted kappa analysis. Results: The estimated ages from the three methods were significantly different from the chronological age, except for Tanner–Whitehouse 3 RUS in males. Regarding the legal age thresholds, Greulich–Pyle showed the best accuracy (83.2% for females and 79.63% for males) for legal age threshold of 10 years old. Fishman method showed the best accuracy for legal age threshold of 13 (77.5% for females and 74.31% for males) and 15 years old (83.08% for females and 73.77% for males). For age threshold of 18 years old, Greulich–Pyle showed an accuracy of 53.85% for females and 54.44% for males. The reliability tests showed substantial to almost perfect agreement. Conclusions: This study showed no significant difference between Tanner–Whitehouse 3 RUS age and chronological age for male subjects of contemporary Thai children and adolescents. However, Greulich–Pyle and Fishman method were superior regarding the accuracy of prediction based on Thai legal age thresholds. Due to the possible effects from ethnical difference and secular changes, adaptation of age estimation methods specifically for contemporary Thai population should be further studied."
"Salicylaldimine-functionalized poly(m-phenyleneethynylene) as turn-on chemosensor for ferric ion  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.A new turn on fluorescent probe for ferric ion based on poly(m-phenyleneethynylene salicylaldimine) (PPE-IM) has been developed. The preparation of PPE-IM involves post-polymerization functionalization of the corresponding polymeric amine, PPE-AM, via the condensation with salicylaldehyde. The degree of polymerization of both PPE-IM and PPE-IM is 17 with polydispersity index of 1.5. In aqueous solution, the polymeric PPE-IM is highly stable unlike its small molecule analog which is gradually hydrolyzed. The weak fluorescence of initial PPE-IM (λem = 470) is greatly enhanced by 300 folds upon the addition of Fe3+. The 1H NMR reveals that the fluorescence enhancement is caused by Fe3+-induced hydrolysis of the imine group. The sensing system shows a detection limit of 0.14 μM of Fe3+.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem. 2018, 56, 1155–1161."
"Autochthonous lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig faeces in Thailand show probiotic properties and antibacterial activity against enteric pathogenic bacteria  2018 Elsevier LtdLactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in pig health and performance that arises from their beneficial impacts on the balance of gastrointestinal microbes, ability to fight enteric pathogens, and capacity to support the immune system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional and safety aspects of five previously isolated autochthonous LAB strains, (Lactobacillus plantarum 22F, 25F and 31F, Pediococcus acidilactici 72N and Pediococcus pentosaceus 77F) from pig faeces as potential probiotics for a pig feed supplement. The functional and safety properties of the strains were assessed by in vitro tests. The functional properties tested were their abilities in tolerating low pH values under simulated gastric conditions, their cell surface properties (hydrophobicity, auto- and co-aggregation), antibacterial activity against the common enteric pathogenic bacteria in pigs (such as pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella Choleraesuis and Streptococcus suis), and diacetyl production. The safety of the strains was analyzed based on the absent of haemolysis on blood and bile salt hydrolase activity. Although all strains demonstrated diacetyl production, good survivability and antibacterial activities, L. plantarum 22F and 25F showed the best performance with the strongest antibacterial actions against the indicator pathogens. Of the strains, only P. pentosaceus 77F exhibited haemolysis or bile salt hydrolase activity. Furthermore, a principal component analysis revealed that L. plantarum 22F possessed superior functional and safety aspects compared to the other four autochthonous strains and to reference strains L. plantarum JCM 1149 and P. acidilactici DSM 20284. Further in vivo studies using oral administration of the strains are justified to assess their effectiveness as feed supplements for pigs."
"Design of multi-grip patterns prosthetic hand with single actuator  2001-2011 IEEE.In hand prosthesis design, the important characteristics that directly affect hand performance are the ability to grasp various type of objects, grasping force that provides stability for holding objects, and cosmetic appearance that resembles the human hand. The presence of all of these characteristics is currently a challenging task for prosthesis design. This paper presents the design of a five-fingered prosthetic hand that has multiple grip patterns with the use of only one actuator in order to perform important tasks in daily life and which achieves significant grip force from the large size of the actuator. The prosthetic hand is capable of performing one neutral position and two grip patterns that are dominant in daily life tasks. Different move patterns are achieved through the use of multiple sets of rigid four-bar linkages which provide different motions to fingers and thumb when the mechanism is actuated to the opposite direction. This paper describes the design of the prosthesis, mechanism synthesis, and achieved performance. The prosthetic hand developed here, having one degree of freedom, is an improvement from conventional single-actuator hands, which can only perform open/close motion. Whereas achieved grip force (34.5 N) is higher than multiple-actuator hands in market. Thus, this design could be an alternative answer of improvement between conventional and multiple degree of freedom prosthetic hands."
"Characteristics of authentic self-esteem of violent juvenile delinquents in Thailand  2018 American Psychological Association.Violent juvenile delinquents often have a problem with self-esteem by acting like people with high self-esteem but in an unstable way. The aim of the study was to investigate the characteristics of authentic self-esteem of male violent juvenile delinquents. A mixedmethods study was conducted by using the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Inventory, followed by an in-depth interview and observation. The results indicated that there were 3 characteristics of authentic self-esteem of male violent Thai juvenile delinquents (a) willingness to improve shortcomings, (b) trying to control oneself by living within reality, and (c) being oneself by trying to be less noticeable. Moreover, from a humanistic perspective, there were 3 individual characteristics: (a) readiness for self-disclosure, (b) affective expression, and (c) authenticity. Consequently, these characteristics should be encouraged by parents and teachers to generate a process of transformative learning."
"Hybrid transdermal drug delivery patch made from poly(p-phenylene vinylene)/natural rubber latex and controlled by an electric field  2018 Society of Chemical IndustryA flexible, natural rubber (NR) patch was developed for electrically controllable transdermal drug delivery. NR latex was crosslinked at various crosslinking ratios under the UV curing method. Ibuprofen (Ibu) was the model drug and was used as the dopant for poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) acting as the drug encapsulating host. For the pristine Ibu-loaded NR patch, the amount of Ibu permeation increased with decreasing crosslink density and increasing electrical potential. For the Ibu-doped PPV/NR patch, the amount of Ibu release−permeation also increased with increasing electrical potential and was higher than that of the pristine NR matrices. Without an applied electric field, the drug remained attached to the PPV during an initial period of 6 h. Under an applied electric field, the oxidation state of the conductive polymer was altered, the iontophoretic effect, pore formation in the NR matrix, expansion of the pore size in hair follicles and PPV chain expansion combined to increase the Ibu release−permeation amount. Thus, the flexible PPV/NR transdermal drug delivery patch was demonstrated to be effective in drug release−permeation based on the strength of the electrical potential, the crosslinking density and the presence of PPV as the encapsulation host.  2018 Society of Chemical Industry."
"Melissopalynological analysis of stingless bee (Tetragonula pagdeni) honey in Eastern Thailand  2018Melissopalynological analysis of 72 Tetragonula pagdeni honey samples, collected from various locations in Chanthaburi (A) and Trat (B) provinces, Eastern Thailand during March 2015, was performed. Overall, 45 pollen types species belonging to 22 plant families were identified. The predominant pollen type was from Nephelium lappaceum and comprised 48.5% of the pollen in honey from location A2 (Pathavee district) and 45.3% in location B1 (AoYai district). The secondary pollen types, Wodyetia bifurcata and Mimosa pudica, accounted for 20.1% and 17.0%, respectively, in location B3 (Nhongsamed district), while Cocos nucifera accounted for 17.2% in location A2. In addition, pollen types of C. nucifera, M. pudica, N. lappaceum, Asystasia gangetica, Amaranthus lividus, Areca catechu, Chromolaena odorata and Durio zibethinus were found in T. pagdeni honey from all sampled locations. Furthermore, in the dearth period, T. pagdeni foraged food (as in pollen was present) from Musa sp., Acacia mangium and various weed species, such as A. gangetica, A. lividus, Ageratum conyzoides, Bidens pilosa, C. odorata, Melampodium divaricatum, Mikania cordata, Merremia umbellata, M. pudica, Pennisetum pedicellarum and Thysanoleana maxima, from within a 500 m radius around the hive to maintain their colonies."
"Impact of non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features on the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology: a multi-institutional study in five Asian countries  2018 Royal College of Pathologists of AustralasiaSeveral Western studies showed that the recent introduction of non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) significantly decreased risk of malignancy for cytological diagnostic categories. We aimed to determine the impact of NIFTP on risk of malignancy within a cohort of thyroid nodules from Asian countries, and to compare distribution of diagnostic categories between NIFTP and invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (eFV-PTC). Consecutive thyroid fine-needle aspirates from six institutions were retrospectively analysed. Histopathology slides with a diagnosis of eFV-PTC were reviewed and reclassified into invasive eFV-PTC and NIFTP. The risk of malignancy was calculated with and without NIFTP. Of 11,372 thyroid nodules, 2044 had available surgical follow-up. NIFTP was diagnosed in 59 cases, which constituted 2.9% of all excised nodules, and 5.3% of malignant nodules. Preoperative cytological diagnoses for NIFTP were non-diagnostic (10.2%), benign (18.6%), atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (22.0%), follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN) (32.2%), suspicious for malignancy (SM) (11.9%), and malignant (5.1%). The only category which showed a relative reduction in risk of malignancy after reclassification of more than 20%, was FN/SFN (24.4%). There was a significantly higher prevalence of benign cytology in NIFTP (p = 0.04) and SM/malignant in invasive eFV-PTC (p = 0.05). A majority of NIFTP cases were classified in indeterminate categories, which decreased the corresponding risk of malignancy. However, the magnitude of NIFTP impact was much lower than in the Western reports. Asian countries may not experience significant effects of NIFTP reclassification on the practice of thyroid cytopathology."
"Innovative Educational Initiatives to Train Psychodynamic Psychiatrists in Underserved Areas of the World  2018 Elsevier Inc.Psychodynamic psychiatry remains a challenging subject to teach in underserved areas, where enthusiasm to learn is substantial. Besides logistical and psychiatric workforce shortcomings, sensible cultural adaptations to make psychodynamic psychiatry relevant outside of high-income countries require creative effort. Innovative pedagogical methods that include carefully crafted mentoring and incorporate videoconferencing in combination with site visits can be implemented through international collaborations. Emphasis on mentoring is essential to adequately train future psychodynamic psychotherapy supervisors. Examples of World Psychiatric Association initiatives in countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, and Thailand are presented as possible models to emulate elsewhere."
"Techno-economic analysis of biodiesel production from palm oil with supercritical methanol at a low molar ratio  2018 Elsevier LtdThe techno-economic analysis of biodiesel production with supercritical methanol (SCM) at a low methanol: oil molar ratio (L-SCM) of 12:1, as well as with a homogeneous alkali-catalyzed process (Alkali-cat) and conventional SCM (C-SCM) with a methanol: oil molar ratio of 42:1 was investigated. The process simulation was performed using the Aspen plus® software based on the plant biodiesel production capacity of 40,000 tonnes/y. Even though the L-SCM had a higher total capital investment than the Alkali-cat process ($7.19 million versus $4.91 million), it was economically viable. The L-SCM process provided a lower manufacturing cost of $37.28 million and the highest net present value (NPV) of $45.48 million. However, the C-SCM process was not financially profitable because of the large amount of methanol employed in the recycling loop. Sensitivity analysis of all the processes was investigated based on variations in the feedstock and products selling price and revealed that the biodiesel selling price and palm oil price were the major effects on the sensitivity of the NPV."
"The role of conserved QXG and binding affinity of S23G & S26G receptors on avian H5, swine H1 and human H1 of influenza A virus hemagglutinin  2018 Elsevier Inc.Outbreaks of avian, human and swine influenza are a serious concern for public health. In the reproductive cycle of the influenza virus, hemagglutinin (HA) is the primary protein responsible for binding to glycan receptor sites on the host cell surface. MD simulations of avian H5, swine H1 and human H1 complexed with S23G and S26G receptors were performed to study the role of key residues on the receptor conformational behaviors, hydrogen bond formation, binding free energy and residue-wise energy contribution. The obtained results indicated that the relative energies of swH1_S23G and swH1_S26G were found to be close to each other (3.1 kcal/mol) while the relative energies of AvH5 and HuH1 were found to be significantly different (11.1 ± 6.8 and 29.0 ± 8.2 kcal/mol for AvH5 and HuH1, respectively)."
"Photocatalytic activity of Nitrogen and Silica doping on TiO2 nanocatalyst and grafted onto PMMA film  2018 Elsevier B.V.In this paper, N-doped and Si-doped TiO2 nanocatalyst as powder and grafted onto PMMA film have been prepared and tested for the photocatalysis toward methylene blue dye under UV and visible light irradiation. The samples were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2-physisorption, UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin resonance (ESR), scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and photoluminescence (PL). The kinetic were used to investigate the performance of grafted film of modified materials compared with pristine TiO2 grafted onto PMMA film. The results showed that, kinetic constant parameter of modified TiO2 were improved both as powder and grafted film."
"Antimicrobial activity of a serine proteinase inhibitor SPIPm5 from the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon  2018 Elsevier LtdA two-domain Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor, SPIPm5, from Penaeus monodon was studied. Its transcript was expressed in all tissues tested including the hemocytes, stomach, gill, lymphoid organ, muscle, intestine and heart albeit less in hepatopancreas and eyestalk. The expression of SPIPm5 gene was also up-regulated by heat stress, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection and yellow head virus (YHV) infection. Injection of recombinant rSPIPm5 protein into normal shrimp to mimic heat stress condition did not have or had little stimulating effect on the expression of other immune genes: crustinPm1, penaeidin3, penaeidin5, Hsp70, SPIPm2 and SPIPm5. Like some other proteinase inhibitors, the rSPIPm5 could inhibit the hemolymph proPO activity. In survival experiments, the rSPIPm5 could prolong the life of WSSV-infected shrimp similar to the effect of heat stress. The rSPIPm5 also helped the YHV-, Vibrio harveyi- and V. parahaemolyticus-infected shrimp survive longer. The increased endurance against microbial infection was due to the inhibitory effects presumably activated by rSPIPm5 on viral replication and bacterial growth but not the expression of antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, the SPIPm5 plays an important role in shrimp innate immunity against the viral and bacterial infection."
"High prevalence of ceftriaxone resistance among invasive Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis isolates in Thailand: The emergence and increase of CTX-M-55 in ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Choleraesuis isolates  2018 Elsevier GmbHS. Choleraesuis is a highly invasive zoonotic pathogen that causes a serious systemic infection in humans. The emergence and increase of resistance to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin among S. Choleraesuis has become a serious therapeutic problem. The present study demonstrated high frequency of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella Choleraesuis among 414 nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates from bacteremic patients in Thailand. High rates of ceftriaxone (58.3%) and ciprofloxacin (19.6%) resistances were observed in S. Choleraesuis isolates. The dissemination of the self-transferable blaCTX-M-14-carrying IncFIIs, IncFII, and IncI1 plasmids and blaCMY-2-carrying IncA/C plasmid along with the clonal spread of blaCMY-2-harbouring S. Choleraesuis isolates contributed to the high frequency of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs; third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) during 2005–2007. We reported the first occurrence of ceftazidime-hydrolysing CTX-M-55 in S. Choleraesuis isolates which dramatically increased and became the most abundant CTX-M variant among ESC-resistant S. Choleraesuis isolates during 2012–2016. The spread of clone pulsotype B3 was due to the dissemination of IncA/C plasmids carrying both blaCTX-M-55 and qnrS1 among ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Choleraesuis isolates harbouring D87G in GyrA. These isolates were apparently responsible for the high rates of co-resistance to ESCs and ciprofloxacin (51.3%) during 2012–2016. This study emphasizes the importance to have an action plan to control the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in S. Choleraesuis since this poses a threat to global health due to travel and trade in animal food products."
"Solution processed blue-emitting and hole-transporting materials from truxene-carbazole-pyrene triads  2018 Elsevier B.V.A new series of truxene derivatives containing different numbers of dipyrenylcarbazole substituents are prepared and evaluated as emissive and hole-transporting layers in electroluminescent devices.

"Effect of sodium thiosulfate on arterial stiffness in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (Sodium Thiosulfate-Hemodialysis Study): A Randomized Controlled Trial  2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.Background: Arterial stiffness (AS) and vascular calcification are significantly related to a high cardiovascular mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate (IV STS) can prevent and delay the vascular calcification progression in uremic states; however, the STS effect on AS has not been assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the STS efficacy on vascular calcification and AS in HD patients. Methods: Fifty HD patients with abnormal AS, as measured via the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI ≥8), were prospectively randomized to open-label 12.5 g IV STS during the last HD hour twice weekly for 6 months (n = 24) or the usual care (control group; n = 26). Patients and treating physicians were not blinded. The CAVI, coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, hemodynamics, and biochemical parameters were measured at the baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Results: All the baseline parameters were comparable. The IV STS significantly reduced the CAVI when compared to the control group (mean CAVI difference = -0.53; 95% CI -1.00 to -0.06; p = 0.03). A significant CAVI improvement was seen in those patients without diabetes mellitus. The natural logarithm of the CAC volume score was significantly increased in the control group. The high sensitivity C-reactive protein level was slightly lowered in the IV STS group (not significant). Conclusion: The intradialytic STS treatment significantly reduced the AS, as measured by the CAVI, and stabilized the vascular calcification in the HD patients. STS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for delaying and treating the structural and functional vascular wall abnormalities in HD patients."
"Use of Nd:YAG laser to recanalize occluded Cypass Micro-Stent in the early post-operative period  2018Purpose: To report the first case of Neodymium Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser use to recanalize a CyPass occluded with a clot in the early postoperative follow-up. Observations: A 66 year-old woman with primary open angle glaucoma and cataract received combined cataract surgery plus CyPass in the right eye. Surgery was uneventful, however, there was a small amount of hyphema related to bleeding around the site of Cypass insertion. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was between 6 and 7 mmHg in the first week on no glaucoma medications. At the second postoperative week, IOP jumped to 30 mmHg and a clot was observed obstructing the CyPass lumen. We disrupted the clot with a single shot from a Nd:YAG laser. Twenty minutes after the laser, the IOP was 8 mmHg. CyPass was recanalized without complications. IOP was 11 mmHg at 1 month postoperatively with timolol 0.5% twice a day. Conclusions and importance: It is important to perform gonioscopy to evaluate for CyPass obstruction in cases of IOP spike. Nd:YAG laser may be a useful approach to recanalize the CyPass in the early postoperative follow-up."
"The effects of sex, skeletal age, and sagittal skeletal pattern on pharyngeal airway dimensions and related structures in growing Thai orthodontic patients  2018 Elsevier Ltd and the Japanese Orthodontic SocietyPurpose: To evaluate the effects of sex, skeletal age, sagittal skeletal pattern, and the interaction among these three factors on the pharyngeal airway widths and areas, and the positions and dimensions of surrounding structures. Materials and methods: Pretreatment lateral cephalometric radiographs of 418 growing orthodontic patients (183 males, 235 females); 6–20 years old (mean age, 13.95 ± 3.62 years), were collected from 2007–2014, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, and divided into 3 skeletal ages according to cervical vertebral maturation stages, pre-pubertal (cervical stages (CS) 1,2), pubertal (CS 3,4), and post-pubertal (CS 5,6). Ten angular, 13 linear, and 3 cephalometric area measurements were analyzed. Three-way ANOVA and Factor analysis were applied to compare sex, skeletal age, and sagittal skeletal pattern differences in the pharyngeal airway dimensions and the surrounding structure dimensions and positions. Results: Sex–skeletal age interactions existed in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airway dimensions, and dimensions and positions (vertical, horizontal) of surrounding structures. Skeletal age–sagittal skeletal pattern interactions also affected the pharyngeal airway dimensions. In the post-pubertal period, male and skeletal Class III subjects tended to have larger pharyngeal airway, tongue, and soft palate dimensions; more anterior positions of the hyoid and tongue; and less obtuse soft palate angulation. The post-pubertal males also had more inferior positions of the hyoid and tongue. Conclusion: Interactions between sex–skeletal age and skeletal age–sagittal skeletal pattern affected the pharyngeal airway dimensions. The surrounding structure positions and dimensions varied according to sex–skeletal age interaction and sagittal skeletal difference."
"A cross-continental comparison of assemblages of seed- and fruit-feeding insects in tropical rain forests: Faunal composition and rates of attack  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: Insects feeding on seeds and fruits represent interesting study systems, potentially able to lower the fitness of their host plants. In addition to true seed eaters, a suite of insects feed on the fleshy parts of fruits. We examined the likelihood of community convergence in whole insect assemblages attacking seeds/fruits in three tropical rain forests. Location: Three ForestGEO permanent forest plots within different biogeographical regions: Barro Colorado Island (Panama), Khao Chong (Thailand) and Wanang (Papua New Guinea). Methods: We surveyed 1,186 plant species and reared 1.1 ton of seeds/fruits that yielded 80,600 insects representing at least 1,678 species. We assigned seeds/fruits to predation syndromes on the basis of plant traits relevant to insects, seed/fruit appearance and mesocarp thickness. Results: We observed large differences in insect faunal composition, species richness and guild structure between our three study sites. We hypothesize that the high species richness of insect feeding on seeds/fruits in Panama may result from a conjunction of low plant species richness and high availability of dry fruits. Insect assemblages were weakly influenced by seed predation syndromes, both at the local and regional scale, and the effect of host phylogeny varied also among sites. At the driest site (Panama), the probability of seeds of a plant species being attacked depended more on seed availability than on the measured seed traits of that plant species. However, when seeds were attacked, plant traits shaping insect assemblages were difficult to identify and not related to seed availability. Main conclusions: We observed only weak evidence of community convergence at the intercontinental scale among these assemblages. Our study suggests that seed eaters may be most commonly associated with dry fruits at relatively dry tropical sites where fleshy fruits may be less prevalent."
"Tuning poly(p-phenylene) nano-size for enhancing electrical conductivity based on surfactant templates and doping  2018 Korean Physical SocietyNanoparticles play a vital role in the material property improvement. For conductive polymers, nanoparticles have been known to affect various electrical properties. This work reports the size-controlled synthesis of poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) nanoparticles using benzene, AlCl3, and CuCl2 as a monomer, catalyst, and oxidant respectively, incorporated with a surfactant template and subsequently doped with various doping agents to increase the electrical conductivity. The effects of surfactant types namely Span65, Tween80, and TritonX100 and surfactant concentrations were investigated. The PPP structure was confirmed by NMR, FT-IR, and XPS techniques. SEM images showed different undoped-PPP (uPPP) morphologies: irregular shape, coral reef shape, spherical shape, and worm-like shape with the particle sizes between ∼30 and ∼120 nm not previously reported. The electrical conductivity of the uPPP with a surfactant was higher than that without a surfactant due to the smaller particle size. From the doping, the electrical conductivity of the doped-PPP (dPPP) increased with the doping agent to monomer mole ratio up to 50:1. The dPPP doped with HClO4 (dPPP/HClO4) at the doping agent to monomer mole ratio of 50:1 exhibited the highest electrical conductivity of 74.34 S cm−1 along with the long term stability in air."
"Nurses' turnover intention: The impact of leader-member exchange, organizational identification and job embeddedness  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: The aim of this study was to examine the influence of three factors on turnover intention: leader-member exchange quality, organizational identification and job embeddedness. This area of inquiry has not been fully investigated in the literature. Background: Employee turnover, particularly of professionals, becomes a very challenging issue. It continually affects organizations in terms of resourcing and developmental costs, manpower instability, day-to-day operations, perception of quality care and efficiency. Therefore, employees' working attitude and behaviour have drawn increasing attention for further research to determine which factors keep them with their employer. Design: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with self-report questionnaires. Methods: Data were collected from 1,966 nurses from sixteen private general hospitals in Thailand during February–June 2016. Hypotheses were tested and analysed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modelling and a bootstrapping procedure. Results: The results revealed the direct relationship between leader-member exchange quality and job embeddedness. Organizational identification played an intermediary role that partially mediated the relationship between leader-member exchange quality on job embeddedness. Analysis also provided support for the mediating effect of organizational identification and turnover intention through job embeddedness. Conclusion: This study extends the job embeddedness theory and gains understanding of the antecedent factors that directly and indirectly cause employees to become embedded and lead to predict turnover intention. The findings are pertinent, as few studies have investigated such relationships. The implications provide insights into how organizations can better retain their workforce."
"Toward non-toxic and simple recovery process of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) using the green solvent 1,3-dioxolane  2018 Elsevier LtdWe aimed to develop a non-toxic and simple recovery procedure for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) based on the use of green solvent. In this study, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 1,3-propanediol, 1,3-dioxolane and ethyl lactate were investigated and compared with chloroform in the extraction of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) from Cupriavidus necator strain A-04. A water-miscible system was developed using 1,3-dioxolane and water. PHB was extracted from dried cells at 80 °C for 6 h in 1,3-dioxolane then water was used to cause phase separation of PHB film from 1,3-dioxolane solution resulted in the recovery yield 92.7% ± 1.4% and purity up to 97.9% ± 1.8%. The physical properties and molecular weight distribution of the PHB recovered were not significantly affected by the 1,3-dioxolane extraction. The PHB obtained from wet cells by 1,3-dioxolane extraction at 80 °C for 6 h had a MW of 4.86 × 105, MN of 3.74 × 105, polydispersity index of 1.30. The recovery process is non-toxic and very simple, thus reducing purification costs."
"Intravital endoscopic technology for real-time monitoring of inflammation caused in experimental periodontitis  2018 Elsevier B.V.We report a novel method for in situ imaging of microvascular permeability in inflamed gingival tissue, using state-of-the-art Cellvizio™ intravital endoscopic technology and a mouse model of ligature-induced periodontitis. The silk ligature was first placed at the upper left second molar. Seven days later, the ligature was removed, and the animals were intravenously injected with Evans blue. Evans blue dye, which selectively binds to blood albumin, was used to monitor the level of inflammation by monitoring vascular permeability in control non-diseased and ligature-induced experimental periodontitis tissue. More specifically, leakage of Evans blue-bound albumin from the micro-capillary to connective tissue indicates the state of inflammation occurring in the specific site. Evans blue leakage from blood vessels was imaged in situ by directly attaching the endoscope (mini Z tip) of the Cellvizio™ system to the gingival tissue without any surgical incision. Evans blue emission intensity was significantly elevated in gingiva of periodontitis lesions, but not control non-ligature placed gingiva, indicating that this technology can be used as a potential minimally invasive diagnostic tool to monitor the level of inflammation at the periodontal disease site."
"Predictive Factors for Death After Snake Envenomation in Myanmar  2018 Wilderness Medical SocietyIntroduction: Factors predictive for death from snake envenomation vary between studies, possibly due to variation in host genetic factors and venom composition. This study aimed to evaluate predictive factors for death from snake envenomation in Myanmar. Methods: A prospective study was performed among adult patients with snakebite admitted to tertiary hospitals in Yangon, Myanmar, from May 2015 to August 2016. Data including clinical variables and laboratory parameters, management, and outcomes were evaluated. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate factors predictive for death at the time of presentation to the hospital. Results: Of the 246 patients with snake envenomation recruited into the study, 225 (92%) survived and 21 (8%) died during hospitalization. The snake species responsible for a bite was identified in 74 (30%) of the patients; the majority of bites were from Russell's vipers (63 patients, 85%). The independent factors predictive for death included 1) duration from bite to arrival at the hospital >1 h (odds ratio [OR]: 9.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1–75.2; P=0.04); 2) white blood cell counts >20 ×103 cells·μL-1 (OR: 8.9, 95% CI: 2.3–33.7; P=0.001); and 3) the presence of capillary leakage (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.2–11.2; P=0.02). A delay in antivenom administration >4 h increases risk of death (11/21 deaths). Conclusions: Patients who present with these independent predictive factors should be recognized and provided with early appropriate intervention to reduce the mortality rate among adults with snake envenomation in Myanmar."

"New design equation for undrained pullout capacity of suction caissons considering combined effects of caisson aspect ratio, adhesion factor at interface, and linearly increasing strength  2018 Elsevier LtdUndrained pullout capacity of suction caisson in clays with homogeneous and linearly increasing strengths with depth was investigated by two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element analysis. Effects of the caisson aspect ratios, the complete range of adhesion factors at soil-caisson interface, and the full range of dimensionless strength gradients on the dimensionless pullout factor of suction caissons were comprehensively examined. Based on a nonlinear regression to the derived finite element solutions, a new design equation of the undrained pullout capacity of suction caissons was proposed, considering the practical ranges of caisson aspect ratios, the complete range of adhesion factors at soil-caisson interface, and a general profile of both homogeneous and linearly increasing strengths with depth. The proposed equation was validated through a comparison of existing solutions and published experimental data."

Karger AG, Basel.Background: Cinacalcet could decrease serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in previous meta-analyses. However, the effect of cinacalcet on the new biomarkers such as fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), bone markers, and vascular calcification are still unestablished. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effects of cinacalcet on all laboratory and clinical spectrums of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD). Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials.gov to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of cinacalcet relative to standard treatment on CKD-MBD surrogate markers and clinical outcomes. Random-effect models were used to compute the weighted mean difference for continuous variables and the risk ratio for binary variables. Results: Twenty-four RCTs (10,031 dialysis patients) were identified. Besides lowering effects on calcium, phosphate, and PTH, cinacalcet significantly reduced bone resorptive marker (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b) but unaltered bone formation markers (bone alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin). Cinacalcet also resulted in significant higher risk of hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Cinacalcet significantly lowered serum FGF-23 level, although unaltered all-cause mortalities. Conclusions: Use of cinacalcet in dialysis patients improves several CKD-MBD-related surrogate markers. However, the benefit on all-cause mortalities was not demonstrated."
"The measurement of drug-induced interferon γ-releasing cells and lymphocyte proliferation in severe cutaneous adverse reactions  2018 European Academy of Dermatology and VenereologyBackground: The lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) is a standard laboratory method to identify culprit drugs in patients with a history of drug-induced non-immediate hypersensitivity and is mainly performed during the recovery phase. The measurement of drug-specific interferon γ (IFN-γ)-releasing cells has been introduced to confirm culprit drugs, even during the acute phase of drug allergy. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the capability of the enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) to detect drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells during the acute phase and the capability of LTT to identify culprit drugs during the recovery phase in patients presenting with severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 23 SCAR patients were collected during the acute and recovery phases and assayed for drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells and lymphocyte proliferation, respectively. Results: Drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells were detectable in 73.9% of SCAR subjects (55.6% and 85.7% in patients who were and were not taking systemic steroids, respectively), whereas LTT results were positive in 52.2% of SCAR subjects. The frequencies of drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells were significantly higher in patients with positive LTT than in those with negative LTT (260.1 ± 110.0 and 46.6 ± 20.7 cells/106 PBMCs, P = 0.01). A significant correlation between the results of the IFN-γ ELISpot assay and LTT was demonstrated (r = 0.65, P value <0.01). Conclusion: The IFN-γ ELISpot assay could be a useful tool to identify culprit drugs in SCAR patients when culprit drug identification is urgently needed during the acute phase of drug allergy."
"Incubation of Aquilaria subintegra with Microbial Culture Supernatants Enhances Production of Volatile Compounds and Improves Quality of Agarwood Oil  2018, Association of Microbiologists of India.Incubation with microbial culture supernatants improved essential oil yield from Aquilaria subintegra woodchips. The harvested woodchips were incubated with de man, rogosa and sharpe (MRS) agar, yeast mold (YM) agar medium and six different microbial culture supernatants obtained from Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and S. cerevisiae prior to hydrodistillation. Incubation with lactic acid bacteria supernatants provided higher yield of agarwood oil (0.45% w/w) than that obtained from yeast (0.25% w/w), agar media (0.23% w/w) and water (0.22% w/w). The composition of agarwood oil from all media and microbial supernatant incubations was investigated by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Overall, three major volatile profiles were obtained, which corresponded to water soaking (control), as well as, both YM and MRS media, lactic acid bacteria, and yeast supernatant incubations. Sesquiterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives were key components of agarwood oil. Fifty-two volatile components were tentatively identified in all samples. Beta-agarofuran, α-eudesmol, karanone, α-agarofuran and agarospirol were major components present in most of the incubated samples, while S. cerevisiae-incubated A. subintegra provided higher amount of phenyl acetaldehyde. Microbial culture supernatant incubation numerically provided the highest yield of agarwood oil compared to water soaking traditional method, possibly resulting from activity of extracellular enzymes produced by the microbes. Incubation of agarwood with lactic acid bacteria supernatant significantly enhanced oil yields without changing volatile profile/composition of agarwood essential oil, thus this is a promising method for future use."

"Electrochemical detection of c-reactive protein based on anthraquinone-labeled antibody using a screen-printed graphene electrode  2018 Elsevier B.V.In this present work, a novel electrochemical immunosensor employing a screen-printed graphene electrode (SPGE) for a simple and highly sensitive determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in a sandwich-type format was proposed. The sensor comprised of two CRP-specific antibodies: an unlabeled capture primary antibody (Anti-1°Ab) and an electrochemically detectable anthraquinone-labeled signaling secondary (AQ-2°Ab) antibody. The Anti-1°Ab was first covalently anchored onto an L-cysteine/gold-modified disposable SPGE (L-Cys/Au/SPGE) to create the anti-CRP surface. After binding of the CRP and the AQ-2°Ab, the electrochemical signal response was measured using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In the presence of CRP, the sensor exhibited a significant increase in the AQ current at AQ-2°Ab compared to the negative control. The CRP concentration was detected in the range of 0.01–150 µg/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) (10 SD/Slope) were 1.5 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL, respectively. This sensor exhibited very high sensitivity in determining CRP and was successfully applied to detect CRP in certified human serum with satisfactory results. The developed sensor is suitable as an alternative method for determination of CRP and the same principle may be further applied to determine other clinically important target molecules."
"Design of a globally stable position estimator for surface permanent-magnet synchronous motors  2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Position estimators of surface permanent-magnet synchronous motors are often designed with local stability and thus may be unstable under a large estimation error. To overcome the risk of instability, a globally stable position estimator is proposed in this paper. The proposed estimator is derived from an alternative expression of the stator model, which has the rotor position as the only parameter inside. Stability analysis of the estimator and conditions for global stability are obtained without any approximation. Design rules for global stability, dynamic, and tracking performances are clearly given. All theoretical results are finally verified by experiment.  2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

"A bibenzyl from Dendrobium ellipsophyllum induces apoptosis in human lung cancer cells  2018, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.Failure of current chemotherapeutic drugs leads to the recurrence of tumor pathology and mortality in lung cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity and related mechanisms of 4,5,4′-trihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxybibenzyl (TDB), a bibenzyl extracted from Dendrobium ellipsophyllum Tang and Wang, in human lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity of TDB (0–300 µM) in different types of human lung cancer cells (H460, H292 and H23) and human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) was evaluated via MTT viability assay. Selective anticancer activity of TDB against human lung cancer cells was demonstrated with a high IC50 (approximately > 300 µM) in DPCs, while IC50 in human lung cancer H460, H292 and H23 cells was approximately 100 ± 5.18, 100 ± 8.73 and 188.89 ± 8.30 µM, respectively. After treatment with 50 µM of TDB for 24 h, flow cytometry analysis revealed the significant increase of early and late apoptosis with absence of necrosis cell death in human lung cancer cells. The up-regulation of p53, a tumor-suppressor protein, was elucidated in human lung cancer cells treated with 10–50 µM of TDB. Alteration to down-stream signaling of p53 including activation of pro-apoptosis protein (Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bax), reduction of anti-apoptosis (B cell lymphoma 2; Bcl-2 and myeloid cell leukemia 1; Mcl-1) and suppression on protein kinase B (Akt) survival pathway were notified in TDB-treated lung cancer cells. The information obtained from this study strengthens the potential development of TDB as an anticancer compound with a favorable human safety profile and high efficacy."
"Occupational exposure to BTEX compounds among enclosed multi-storey car park workers in central Bangkok area  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.Multi-storey parking structures have potentially high concentrations of benzene (B), toluene (T), ethylbenzene (E) and xylene (X) – known as BTEX which could cause adverse health effects to humans. This study sought to estimate BTEX exposure concentrations among car park workers and to evaluate the extent to which, if at all, changes in urine metabolites are associated with BTEX exposure. Personal BTEX samples were collected from workers. Pre-shift and post-shift urinary metabolites, trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA), hippuric acid (HA) and methyl hippuric acid were assessed using standard procedures. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between BTEX exposure concentrations and changes in urinary metabolites. BTEX concentrations in the car park on Sunday were lower than other days of the week, for instance median concentrations of toluene were 23.3 µg/m3 on Sunday and 48.3 µg/m3 during average weekdays (Tuesday–Friday). Benzene and toluene concentrations adjusted for day of week differences were associated with changes from pre-shift to post-shift in urine t,t-MA and HA, respectively. Car park workers were more likely to be exposed to lower concentrations of BTEX during weekdays compared to weekends. Provision of personal chemical safety protection and rigorous evaluation of its effectiveness in reducing BTEX exposure should be provided to protect workers of car parks."
"New insights from Thailand into the maternal genetic history of Mainland Southeast Asia  The Author(s) 2018.Tai-Kadai (TK) is one of the major language families in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), with a concentration in the area of Thailand and Laos. Our previous study of 1234 mtDNA genome sequences supported a demic diffusion scenario in the spread of TK languages from southern China to Laos as well as northern and northeastern Thailand. Here we add an additional 560 mtDNA genomes from 22 groups, with a focus on the TK-speaking central Thai people and the Sino-Tibetan speaking Karen. We find extensive diversity, including 62 haplogroups not reported previously from this region. Demic diffusion is still a preferable scenario for central Thais, emphasizing the expansion of TK people through MSEA, although there is also some support for gene flow between central Thai and native Austroasiatic speaking Mon and Khmer. We also tested competing models concerning the genetic relationships of groups from the major MSEA languages, and found support for an ancestral relationship of TK and Austronesian-speaking groups."
"Complexometric and argentometric titrations using thread-based analytical devices  2018 Elsevier B.V.This work describes analytical approaches based on simple complexometric and argentometric titrations leading to the color change of a novel microfluidic thread-based analytical device (µTAD). The device was fabricated from a cotton thread (15 cm) treated with indicator solution, providing an easy-to-use platform for rapid measurement of analyte concentration in aqueous solution. The thread was immobilized onto a support, being a polypropylene sheet or box platform, to facilitate loading of liquid samples. Interaction between the deposited reagents and analytes in the samples then occurred within a few minutes. This resulted in zones of color change with different lengths along the thread depending on the analyte concentration. The interaction zones can be analyzed by human eyes based on comparison of the zone lengths with the printed scales which are correlated with the analyte concentrations. Complexometric titration using µTADs was initially investigated for Mg(II) determination in water and rubber latex samples. These devices consisted of two threads which were pretreated with Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and then treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer at pH 10. Both threads were tied together with a central knot before being attached to the box platform prior to the analysis. Load of sample solution (6 µL) resulted in the length of red-violet color product on the threads being proportional to the concentration of Mg(II) in waters and rubber latex samples with the working concentration range of 25–1000 mg L−1. In addition, µTAD with a supporting polypropylene sheet consisting of several threads treated with AgNO3 and K2CrO4 indicators was applied for argentometric titration of chloride ion in water and food seasoning samples. After sample loading (3 µL), the initially red-brown threads turned into white corresponding to formation of AgCl(s) on the threads with a working concentration range of 75–600 mg L−1. Greater selectivity towards Mg(II) and chloride compared with potential interference ions was also observed. All the developed μTADs were applied for analysis of real samples which showed results being in agreement with those obtained by classical titrations."
"Electrical conductivity response of methanol sensor based on conductive polyindole  2018 Elsevier B.V.A methanol sensor based on polyindole was investigated and reported in this work. The polyindole sensor response was monitored by the electrical conductivity change at room temperature. The sensor responses of various vapors from non-polar, low polar, and high polar solvents were investigated; the highest relative responses of conductivity were observed when exposed to vapors from high polar solvents, especially methanol possessing the highest dielectric constant (ε) and hydrogen bonding interaction (δH) relative to other vapors inducing the highest interaction to the conductive polymer. The discrimination analysis of sensor was evaluated by the principal component analysis (PCA), it demonstrated that the sensor possessed the good discrimination efficiency towards high polar vapors. The sensor response depended on the doping mole ratio which was related to electrical conductivity of the conductive polymer. In this work, the dPIn/FeCl3 with the doping mole ratio of 10:1 provided the highest methanol relative response of conductivity of 57.83 at the low concentration of 11.36 ppm using nitrogen as a base gas. The sensitivity to methanol vapor was 5.27 ppm−1 with the correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9965, the theoretical limit of detection was as low as 0.048 ppm. The sensor based on the dPIn/FeCl3 10:1 is shown here a good candidate for use as a methanol sensing material."
"An 8-aminoquinoline derivative as a molecular platform for fluorescent sensors for Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions  2018 Elsevier B.V.The amide derivatives of 8-aminoquinoline with two types of amino acid pendants, i.e. glycine and β-alanine, are evaluated for fluorescence sensing of various metal ions. In Tris-HCl aqueous buffer solution, the derivative containing glycine exhibits selective fluorescence enhancement with Zn2+. The fluorescence turn-on signal at a longer wavelength is a result of the binding between N-8-aminoquinolinylglycinamide and Zn2+ which is promoted by the deprotonation of the amide proton. However, both Zn2+ and Cd2+ induce the turn-on signal in ethanol solution. X-ray crystallography of single crystals of both Zn2+ and Cd2+ complexes formed in ethanol reveals 1-D coordination polymer structures in which the metal ions are tethered with N and O of the amide groups. Simultaneous detection of Zn2+ and Cd2+ are possible by using paper chromatographic separation and the ligand as a visualizing agent. The fluorescence imaging of either Zn2+ or Cd2+ in plant tissue is demonstrated. The conjugation of the ligand with dimethylaminophenylacetylene effectively tunes the emission color of the ligand while retaining the sensing selectivity. Therefore, N-8-aminoquinolinylglycinamide is a simple yet effective binding probe for Zn2+ and Cd2+ with excellent fluorescence signal transduction."
"Preparation of sulfonated zeolite ZSM-5/sulfonated polysulfone composite membranes as PEM for direct methanol fuel cell application  2018 Elsevier B.V.Sulfonated ZSM-5 zeolite was successfully prepared by organo-functionalization method using poly (2‑acrylamido‑2‑methylpropanesulfonic acid) and pAMPS. The modified ZSM-5 zeolite was characterized by TGA, EDX and XRD. The results showed that the organo-functional groups were incorporated onto the ZSM-5 surface. The structures of the modified ZSM-5/sulfonated polysulfone composite membranes were characterized by SEM. The SEM results showed a uniform and homogeneous distribution of the modified ZSM-5 zeolite in the sulfonated polysulfone matrix. The existence of the modified ZSM-5 in the sulfonated polysulfone, (with the degree of sulfonation equal to 70.57%) significantly improved the water uptake, proton conductivity, methanol permeability, and ion exchange capacity of the composite membranes relative to the pristine sulfonated polysulfone."
"Systematizing Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM): Case of urban flood-prone community in Thailand upstream area  2018 Elsevier LtdFlooding risk in Thailand has been exacerbated by rapid urbanization, deforestation in the uplands and poor disaster management system. Important lessons learned from the long history and experiences of flood disasters point to the need for better solutions to reduce damage to property and life. However, progress in organizing community disaster management is slow and reveals limitations in disaster risk reduction by the community and government in general. Nevertheless, in this limited case study of three flood prone communities, some of them were found to have developed the coping ability to organize and manage the situation to ensure their safety. They innovated their own solutions to reduce the risk posed by floods instead of waiting for and wholly depending on support from the government. The study has found evidence of spontaneous Community Disaster Risk Management Organization (CDRMO) formation in the case study of Thai communities. This important finding leads to the main question raised in this study: ‘how is a system of Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) and CDRMO formed in Thai communities?’ This research is based on an empirical study using field interviews, surveys, participatory observation, focus group discussions and questionnaires to describe how community solutions that can be defined as an organic system of CBDRM and CDRMO in Thailand were achieved. This research discusses possibilities to promote CDRMO in other Thai communities using the lessons learned from the innovations made in some communities and incorporating them in policy design in order to promote a CBDRM system in Thailand."
"Optimization of coconut protein deamidation using protein-glutaminase and its effect on solubility, emulsification, and foaming properties of the proteins  2017 Elsevier LtdThe optimization of deamidation by protein-glutaminase (PG) on coconut protein (CP) and its effect on protein properties were studied. The optimum conditions were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). It was found that the optimum conditions were: enzyme:substrate ratio (E/S) of 36 U/g protein, temperature of 50 °C and pH of 7.0. The selected functional properties of treated CP subjected to deamidation for 15 min, 6 h, and 12 h, respectively were determined. Comparatively to control sample, the solubility of deamidated CP was improved at pH = 3.0 (p ≤.05). Water-holding and oil-holding capacities were not different from control after PG deamidation. Emulsifying activity index (EAI) of 15 min deamidated sample was decreased, while EAIs of 6 and 12 h deamidated protein were not different from control. Emulsifying stability index of all deamidated samples were increased. Foaming capacity was increased after PG deamidation, while the foaming stability was decreased. It was also found that small molecular proteins were increased after PG deamidation."
"Seroprevalence of brucellosis in goats and sheep in Thailand: Results from the Thai National Brucellosis Surveillance System from 2013 to 2015  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbHIn Thailand, brucellosis re-emerged in humans in 2003 and is considered a public health risk to goat farmers as the disease is endemic in small ruminants. The Thai Department of Livestock Development (DLD) established a nationwide surveillance system for brucellosis in goats and sheep in 1997. Using data from this surveillance system, we describe the seroprevalence of brucellosis from 2013 to 2015 in small ruminants and the spatial distribution of the disease throughout Thailand. Surveillance data collected included the number of animals and herds tested, the province of the animal and herd and the laboratory results. Seroprevalence was estimated at both the animal and herd levels. During the 3-year period, 443,561 goats and sheep were tested for brucellosis by the DLD throughout Thailand using the Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for Brucella. Among the 3 years, 2013 had the highest proportion of herds that tested positive for brucellosis at 13.80% (95% CI, 12.52, 15.16). Overall, this study found that brucellosis seroprevalence in small ruminants is decreasing throughout Thailand. However, there is variability in the spread of the disease with provinces in the eastern and western regions of Thailand having higher proportions of animals and herds testing positive. Overall provinces in the south had the lowest proportion of animals and herds testing positive for brucellosis. Periodic review of surveillance data documents the impact of the current brucellosis control programme and supports a targeted response in higher prevalence regions when there are limited financial resources for control measures."
"Goat milk: Non-invasive source for mammary epithelial cell isolation and in vitro culture  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbHMammary epithelial cells (MECs) used to study mammary gland function in vitro are typically isolated from mammary tissue. Breast milk offers an alternative source of MECs to replace mammary gland tissue. This study aimed to isolate and culture MECs from goat milk. Samples of fresh goat milk were collected from early and late-lactating Saanen goats. Samples were subjected to isolation, culture and characterization for putative MECs. The cells adhered to the culture dishes 1 day after isolation and displayed a monolayer pattern, epithelial-like cobblestone morphology, and formed alveoli-like structures that are typical of MECs. We identified the epithelial origin of the isolated cell by staining with antibodies against cytokeratin 8, 18 and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, some of the isolated cells expressed the stem cell marker stage-specific embryonic antigen-4. The transcription of Capra hircus β-casein (CNS2) gene, a candidate gene for analysis of lactational function, was detected in MECs after induced differentiation. In addition, green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing cells could be generated from goat milk-derived MECs. This study demonstrated that goat MECs can be easily isolated from milk samples collected from early and late-lactating goats. Our MECs model could be an effective model for in vitro studies of milk synthesis and gene targeting in the goat mammary gland. Isolation of MECs from goat milk rather than mammary tissue improves animal welfare and can be used as a replacement for the animal in future studies."
"Corrosion of metal orthodontic brackets and archwires caused by fluoride-containing products: Cytotoxicity, metal ion release and surface roughness  2018 Elsevier Ltd and the Japanese Orthodontic SocietyPurpose: The aims of this study were to determine the cytotoxicity, metal ion release and surface roughness of metal orthodontic appliances after immersion in different fluoride product solutions. Materials and methods: Twelve sets of 20 brackets and four tubes were ligated with three types of archwires: stainless steel, nickel-titanium, and beta-titanium. The samples in each archwire group were divided into three subgroups and immersed in solutions of fluoride toothpaste, 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF), or artificial saliva without fluoride as a control group. The immersion times were estimated from the recommended time of using each fluoride product for 3 months. The samples were immersed in cell culture medium for 7 days. Primary gingival fibroblast cell viability was determined by an MTT assay. Metal ion (nickel, chromium, iron, and molybdenum) release and surface roughness were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and a noncontact optical 3-dimensional surface characterization and roughness measuring device, respectively. The bracket and wire surface morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The data were analysed by Two-way ANOVA. Results: In the APF groups, the four metal ion levels and surface roughness of the brackets and archwires significantly increased, while cell viability significantly decreased, especially in the TMA subgroup. The SEM results showed that the brackets and wires in the APF groups demonstrated more lines and grooves compared with the other groups. Conclusion: Using APF gel during orthodontic treatment with fixed metal appliances should be avoided."
"The Synergy of Endotoxin and (1→3)-β-D-Glucan, from Gut Translocation, Worsens Sepsis Severity in a Lupus Model of Fc Gamma Receptor IIb-Deficient Mice  2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.We investigated the influence of spontaneous gut leakage upon polymicrobial sepsis in a lupus model with Fc gamma receptor IIb-deficient (FcGRIIb-/-) mice aged 8 and 40 weeks, as representing asymptomatic and symptomatic lupus, respectively. Spontaneous gut leakage, determined by (i) the presence of FITC-dextran, (ii) elevated serum endotoxin, and (iii) elevated serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG), was demonstrated in symptomatic lupus but not in the asymptomatic group. In parallel, spontaneous gut leakage, detected by elevated serum BG without fungal infection, was demonstrated in patients with active lupus nephritis. Gut leakage induced by dextran sulfate solution (DSS) or endotoxin administration together with BG or endotoxin alone, but not BG alone, enhanced the severity of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis more prominently in 8-week-old FcGRIIb-/- mice. Additionally, the bone marrow-derived macrophages of FcGRIIb-/- mice produced higher cytokine levels when coexposed to endotoxin and BG, when compared to wild-type mice. In summary, spontaneous gut leakage was demonstrated in symptomatic FcGRIIb-/- mice and the induction of gut permeability worsened sepsis severity. Gut translocation of endotoxin and BG had a minor effect on wild-type mice, but the synergistic effect of BG and endotoxin was prominent in FcGRIIb-/- mice. The data suggest that therapeutic strategies addressing gut leakage may be of interest in sepsis conditions in patients with lupus."
"Comparison of water-use characteristics of landscape tree (Tabebuia argentea) and palm (Ptychosperma macarthurii) species in a tropical roof garden with implications for urban water management  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.In cities, landscape palms and trees are planted for scenic views and normally maintained with frequent irrigation. With similar water input, their morphological difference may lead to different water-use that varies seasonally. Thus, evaluating their water-use patterns is necessary to achieve proper urban water management. Here, we examined water-use characteristics of Tabebuia argentea and Ptychosperma macarthurii, a tree and a palm species, in a roof garden in Bangkok, Thailand. Self-constructed Granier’s probes were used for sap flux measurement and monitored for five months in 2016. Results showed that palm transpired 3–4 times higher water than tree daily. With frequent watering, tree was more sensitive to increasing vapor pressure deficit (D) than palm on rain-free days. When rainfall occurred, however, both species became less sensitive to D and continued consuming more water at high D. Extending the analysis to include a hypothetical warming climate with +4.8 °C temperature, we found that tree saved more water than palm on rain-free days. However, daily transpiration of both species increased similarly by 14–18% on rainy days. These results imply that Tabebuia argentea may provide ecosystem benefits by conservatively using water under drought and decelerating runoff from the garden when storms come. In contrast, Ptychosperma macarthurii may provide ecosystem disservice with high water-use in dry season but may slow down runoff in wet season and therefore benefiting downstream ecosystems. These findings are useful for selective planting associated with future changes in precipitation patterns, leading to sustainable urban water management."
"The impact of wire caliber on ERCP outcomes: a multicenter randomized controlled trial of 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewires  2018Background and Aims: Wire-guided biliary cannulation has been demonstrated to improve cannulation rates and reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), but the impact of wire caliber has not been studied. This study compares successful cannulation rates and ERCP adverse events by using a 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewire. Methods: A randomized, single blinded, prospective, multicenter trial at 9 high-volume tertiary-care referral centers in the Asia-Pacific region was performed. Patients with an intact papilla and conventional anatomy who did not have malignancy in the head of the pancreas or ampulla and were undergoing ERCP were recruited. ERCP was performed by using a standardized cannulation algorithm, and patients were randomized to either a 0.025-inch or 0.035-inch guidewire. The primary outcomes of the study were successful wire-guided cannulation and the incidence of PEP. Overall successful cannulation and ERCP adverse events also were studied. Results: A total of 710 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary wire-guided biliary cannulation rate was similar in 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch wire groups (80.7% vs 80.3%; P =.90). The rate of PEP between the 0.025-inch and the 0.035-inch wire groups did not differ significantly (7.8% vs 9.3%; P =.51). No differences were noted in secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Similar rates of successful cannulation and PEP were demonstrated in the use of 0.025-inch and 0.035-inch guidewires. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01408264.)"
"In vitro activities of carbapenems in combination with amikacin, colistin, or fosfomycin against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates  2018 Elsevier Inc.Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates (n=23) were investigated for carbapenem resistance mechanisms and in vitro activities of carbapenems in combination with amikacin, colistin, or fosfomycin. Major carbapenem resistance mechanism was OXA-23 production. The vast majority of these isolates were OXA-23–producing A. baumannii ST195 and ST542, followed by novel STs, ST1417, and ST1423. The interuption of carO by a novel insertion sequence, ISAba40, was found in two isolates. The combinations of imipenem and fosfomycin, meropenem and amikacin, imipenem and amikacin, and imipenem and colistin were synergistic against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii by 65.2%, 46.2%, 30.8%, and 17.4%, respectively. Surprisingly, the combination of imipenem and fosfomycin was the most effective in this study against A. baumannii, which is intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin. Imipenem and fosfomycin inhibit cell wall synthesis; therefore, fosfomycin may be an adjuvant and enhance the inhibition of cell wall synthesis of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii when combined with imipenem."
"Active packaging from chitosan-titanium dioxide nanocomposite film for prolonging storage life of tomato fruit  2018 Elsevier B.V.The feasibility of active packaging from chitosan (CS) and chitosan containing nanosized titanium dioxide (CT) to maintain quality and extend storage life of climacteric fruit was investigated. The CT nanocomposite film and CS film were fabricated using a solution casting method and used as active packaging to delay ripening process of cherry tomatoes. Changes in firmness, weight loss, a*/b* color, lycopene content, total soluble solid, ascorbic acid, and concentration of ethylene and carbon dioxide of the tomatoes packaged in CT film, CS film, and control (without CT or CS films) were monitored during storage at 20 °C. Classification of fruit quality as a function of different packaging treatments was visualized using linear discriminant analysis. Tomatoes packaged in the CT film evolved lower quality changes than those in the CS film and control. The results suggested that the CT film exhibited ethylene photodegradation activity when exposed to UV light and consequently delayed the ripening process and changes in the quality of the tomatoes."
"Effects of turmeric extract on hemin-induced low-density lipoprotein oxidation  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Hemin is an oxidative mediator elevated in disease states including sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. The rhizome of Curcuma longa L. contains yellow pigments called curcuminoids which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of the study was to compare the protective effects of curcuminoids, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and tetrahydrocurcumin on hemin-induced LDL oxidation (he-oxLDL). He-oxLDL showed the depletion of α-tocopherol, an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs), and alteration of the lipid composition in low-density lipoprotein. The levels of cholesteryl arachidonate, cholesteryl linoleate and the cholesteryl linoleate/cholesteryl oleate ratio were decreased. All test compounds showed antioxidant activity that protected against hemin-induced lipid peroxidation, based on the inhibition of TBARs formation, reduced depletion of α-tocopherol, decreased damage to lipids, and a reduced decrease in the cholesteryl linoleate/cholesteryl oleate ratio. A significant protective effect against he-oxLDL was found to be tetrahydrocurcumin ≥ curcumin ≥ curcuminoids > demethoxycurcumin ≥ bisdemethoxycurcumin ≥ α-tocopherol (p <.05). Practical applications: Curcuma longa L. has traditionally been used in Ayurvedic medicine for treatment of conditions such as arthritis, ulcer, jaundice, wounds, and skin diseases. It has also been used as a food additive. The results from this study demonstrated that curcuminoids derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L. are the potential substances for protecting hemin-induced LDL oxidation which may be developed as a functional food for the prevention of diseases related to low-density lipoprotein oxidation."
"Acceptability of Self-Sample Human Papillomavirus Testing Among Thai Women Visiting a Colposcopy Clinic  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.We offered self-sampling devices to 250 women who visited the colposcopy clinic at Chulabhorn Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand from March 1 to June 30, 2015. Participants received instruction about the vaginal self-sample method and collected the specimen themselves, before being examined by the physician who obtained a conventional cervical specimen. Participating women’s attitudes and feelings regarding the self-sample method were explored using a short questionnaire. Of the 247 eligible women, more than 90% of participants rated the self-sample method as very good to excellent for convenience, comfort, and safety. In addition, 80% of participants reported the overall experience of using the self-sample device was very good to excellent compared with the physician-collected method. Self-sample HPV testing appears to be highly accepted and perceived as convenient, comfortable, and safe. More studies on self-sample HPV testing should be conducted in Thailand to investigate this as an alternative method of cervical cancer screening, particularly among women who do not attend the screening program."
"Thai Norms for Name, Image, and Category Agreement, Object Familiarity, Visual Complexity, Manipulability, and Age of Acquisition for 480 Color Photographic Objects  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Normative databases containing psycholinguistic variables are commonly used to aid stimulus selection for investigations into language and other cognitive processes. Norms exist for many languages, but not for Thai. The aim of the present research, therefore, was to obtain Thai normative data for the BOSS, a set of 480 high resolution color photographic images of real objects (Brodeur et al. in PLoS ONE 5(5), 2010. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010773). Norms were provided by 584 Thai university students on eight dimensions: name agreement, object familiarity, visual complexity, category agreement, image agreement, two types of manipulability (graspability and mimeability), and age of acquisition. The results revealed comparatively similar levels of name agreement to Brodeur et al. especially when unfamiliar items were factored out. The pattern of intercorrelations among the Thai psycholinguistic norms was comparable to previous studies and our cross-linguistic correlations were robust for the same set of pictures in English and French. Conjointly, the findings extend the relevancy of the BOSS to Thailand, supporting this photographic resource for investigations of language and other cognitive processes in monolingual, multilingual, and brain-impaired populations."
"Uncomplicated common bile duct stone removal guided by cholangioscopy versus conventional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Background: Although previous studies have reported the possibility of therapeutic ERCP without fluoroscopy, more robust documentation of fluoroscopy-free common bile duct stone (CBDS) clearance is needed. Technically, “digital cholangioscopy” (DCS) may be used to confirm CBDS clearance. We aimed to compare the feasibility, safety, and radiation exposure between patients with CBDS undergoing stone removal by DCS and conventional ERCP (cERCP). Methods: Fifty (50) consecutive patients with a CBDS size < 15 mm underwent DCS (SpyGlass DS Direct Visualization System, Boston Scientific, Marlboro, MA, USA) between December 2015 and October 2016. Of 202 consecutive patients undergoing cERCP during the same time frame, 50 matched pairs were created using propensity score matching analysis. In the DCS group, patients underwent biliary cannulation and CBDS removal without fluoroscopy followed by DCS to confirm complete CBDS clearance. A final occlusion cholangiogram was performed as the current standard of care to confirm CBDS clearance. Results: Cannulation success rates were similar between the DCS and cERCP groups (98 vs. 98%). By intention-to-treat analysis, CBDS clearance in the DCS and cERCP groups was not different (90 vs. 98%; p = 0.20, respectively). DCS had successful CBDS removal in 45 cases, whereas 5 (10%) failed for clearance by DCS due to technical limitations. Adverse events were not different between both groups. Conclusions: In the management of uncomplicated CBDS, our data confirmed the feasibility of DCS for CBDS clearance as it showed efficacy and safety comparable to those of cERCP. Although certain conditions may limit its effectiveness, DCS offers the ability to perform CBDS clearance without the need for fluoroscopy unit and can avoid radiation exposure while ERCP under fluoroscopy remains the current standard of care in patients with CBDS."
"Long-term renal outcome in pediatric glomerulonephritis associated with crescent formation  2017, Japanese Society of Nephrology.Background: Information on long-term renal outcome of pediatric glomerulonephritis associated with crescent formation is limited. A single center retrospective study was conducted to assess long-term renal survival and to determine whether the 2010 classification for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis can predict renal outcome in pediatric glomerulonephritis associated with crescent formation. Methods: Biopsy and clinical data of children, aged ≤ 18 years with ≥ 10 glomeruli and ≥ 10% crescentic glomeruli during January 1998 to December 2015, were reviewed. Biopsies were classified according to the 2010 classification into focal, crescentic, mixed, and sclerotic classes. The clinical endpoint was end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Results: Of 72 children, 14 patients (19.4%) had positive ANCA. The biopsy indication was rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in 38 patients (52.8%) and 22 patients (30.6%) required dialysis at onset. Lupus nephritis was the most common diagnosis (43.1%), followed by IgA nephropathy/Henoch–Schoenlein purpura (HSP) (22.2%). ESRD occurred in 18 patients (25%) and the risk of ESRD differed among the histological classifications (p < 0.001). Dialysis at onset and sclerotic class was independent predictors of ESRD in an adjusted model. The risk of ESRD was four-fold higher in patients requiring dialysis at onset and 7.7-fold higher in sclerotic patients than in crescentic patients. Conclusions: The probability of ESRD was substantial in pediatric glomerulonephritis associated with crescent formation. The 2010 classification is useful for establishing long-term renal prognosis. Future research is required to validate whether histological classification could be a determinant in therapeutic guideline modification, since long-term renal prognosis is different in each class."
"Fabrication of Admicelled Natural Rubber by Polycaprolactone for Toughening Poly(lactic acid)  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Natural rubber (NR) with polycaprolactone (PCL) core–shell (NR-ad-PCL), synthesized by admicellar polymerization, was acted as an impact modifier for poly(lactic acid) (PLA). PLA and NR-ad-PCL were melt-blended using a co-rotating twin screw extruder. The morphology of PLA/NR-ad-PCL blends showed good adhesion as smooth boundary around rubber particles and PLA matrix. Only 5 wt% of rubber phase, NR-ad-PCL was more effective than NR to enhance toughness and mechanical properties of PLA. The contents of the NR-ad-PCL were varied from 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%. From thermal results, the incorporation of the NR-ad-PCL decreased the glass transition temperature and slightly increased degree of crystallinity of PLA. Mechanical properties of the PLA/NR-ad-PCL blends were investigated by dynamic mechanical analyser, pendulum impact tester and universal testing machine for tension and flexural properties. The increasing NR-ad-PCL contents led to decreasing Young’s and storage moduli but increasing loss modulus. Impact strength and elongation at break of the PLA/NR-ad-PCL blends increased with increasing NR-ad-PCL content up to 15 wt% where the maximum impact strength was about three times higher than that of pure PLA and the elongation at break increased to 79%."
"Gain-of-function mutation in PTPN11 in histiocytic sarcomas of Bernese Mountain Dogs  2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdHistiocytic sarcoma (HS) is an aggressive malignant neoplasm of dendritic cell origin that is common in certain breeds of dogs. High prevalence of fatal, disseminated HS has been described in Bernese Mountain Dogs (BMDs). Support for genetic predisposition to develop HS has been presented in several studies, but to date, causative genetic events have not been reported. In addition, no driver mutations have been identified in tumours. Recently, E76K gain-of-function mutation in SHP2 encoded by the PTPN11 gene has been described in human histiocytic malignancies. In our study, we identified the PTPN11E76K in HS of BMDs. Amplification of exon 3 of the PTPN11 gene followed by Sanger sequencing was used to detect the mutation and estimate the prevalence in HS from 30 BMDs, 13 Golden Retrievers and 10 other dog breeds. The overall prevalence of PTPN11E76K in HS of BMDs was 36.67% compared with 8.69% in other breeds. No mutation was identified in normal tissues from 10 BMDs with HS that carried the mutation and 12 control dogs with no neoplastic disease, including 6 BMDs. Increased immunoreactivity for AKT, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated AKT in a small subset of BMDs with PTPN11E76K suggests that a gain-of-function might be mediated by the ERK and AKT pathways. These data suggest PTPN11E76K as an important driver mutation of HS in BMDs. This information may not only aid in unravelling the tumourigenic events associated with HS in BMDs, but also help in identifying more promising therapeutic strategies."
"Morphological characteristics of the tongue and lingual papillae of the large bamboo rat (Rhizomys sumatrensis)  2017, Japanese Association of Anatomists.The large bamboo rat (Rhizomys sumatrensis) is a fossorial rodent found throughout Indochina that has a distinct habitat dominated by bamboo thickets. In the study reported here, the lingual biology of this rodent is described in detail, based on characteristic features of the tongue and lingual papillae as determined by light and scanning electron microscopy studies. The tongue was found to be elongated with a rounded apex and possessed a median groove and a well-developed intermolar prominence. Three types of the papillae were found on the dorsal lingual surface: filiform, fungiform and vallate papillae. The most abundant papillae were the filiform papillae, the majority of which had a wide base and fork-like processes. Rounded fungiform papillae with one to four taste buds were randomly distributed among the filiform papillae, with a high density found at the anterior tongue, particularly the apex. Two oval vallate papillae were observed on the posterior part of the tongue, surrounded by a circumferential groove into which their numerous gustatory pores opened. The lingual radix had no papillae but contained mucus-secreting Weber’s salivary glands. Structural adaptations of the tongue to meet the functional demands of food ingestion and food manipulation in the oral cavity are also discussed."
"Changes in Tryptophan Catabolite (TRYCAT) Pathway Patterning Are Associated with Mild Impairments in Declarative Memory in Schizophrenia and Deficits in Semantic and Episodic Memory Coupled with Increased False-Memory Creation in Deficit Schizophrenia  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Evidence indicates that schizophrenia and in particular negative symptoms and deficit schizophrenia are accompanied by neurocognitive impairments and changes in the patterning of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway. This cross-sectional study was carried out to examine the associations between cognitive functions (as measured with Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD)) and TRYCAT pathway patterning in patients with (n = 40) and without (n = 40) deficit schizophrenia and normal controls (n = 40). Cognitive measures were assessed with the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Word List Memory (WLM), Constructional Praxis, Word List Recall (WLRecall), and Word List Recognition (WLRecognition), while TRYCAT measurements assessed the IgA/IgM responses to noxious TRYCATs, namely quinolinic acid (QA), 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), picolinic acid (PA), and xanthurenic (XA) acid, and more protective (PRO) TRYCATs, including kynurenic acid (KA) and anthranilic acid (AA). IgA NOX/PRO, IgM KA/3HK, and IgA/IgM NOX/PRO ratios were computed. Schizophrenia was accompanied by lower VFT and WLM, while BNT (dysnomia) and MMSE are significantly lower in multiple- than first-episode schizophrenia. Deficit schizophrenia is strongly associated with worse outcomes on VFT, MMSE, WLM, WLRecall, WLRecognition, and delayed recall savings and increased false memories. Around 40–50% of the variance in negative symptoms’ scores was explained by VFT, WLM, WLRecall, and MMSE. Increases in IgA NOX/PRO, IgM KA/3HK, and/or IgA/IgM NOX/PRO ratios were associated with impairments in VFT, BNT, MMSE, WLM, WLRecall, WLRecognition, and false-memory creation. In conclusion, nondeficit schizophrenia is accompanied by mild memory impairments, while disease progression is accompanied by broader cognitive impairments. Deficit schizophrenia and negative symptoms are strongly associated with deficits in working memory, delayed recall and recognition, and increased false-memory creation. These cognitive impairments and memory deficits are in part explained by increased production and/or attenuated regulation of TRYCATs with neurotoxic, excitotoxic, immune-inflammatory, oxidative, and nitrosative potential, which may contribute to neuroprogression."
"Identification of Ethanol-inducible Genes and Isolation of the Myb-related Protein-like Promoter in Oryza sativa L  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.The ethanol-inducible system derived from Aspergillus nidulans has been used for gene expression analysis in plants. However, the response of non-transformed plants to ethanol suggests that this system may be present in plants. Therefore, it is possible to use an ethanol-inducible promoter derived from plants for gene regulation. In this study, effects of ethanol on rice growth were examined and an ethanol-inducible gene from rice was identified. The ethanol-inducible transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were identified using cDNA-AFLP. These TDFs corresponded to genes involving different pathways including stress response. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, five TDFs, which were homologous to Os07g0240300, Os02g0175700, Os05g0392100, Os03g0569000, Os07g0627300, and adh2, were up-regulated. Among them, Os07g0627300 is highly conserved and expressed in several tissues; therefore, the promoter of Os07g0627300 was isolated and analyzed for motifs and promoter activity. The results indicated that it was a TATA-less promoter containing a number of motifs involved in stress responses. Transient expression results revealed that this promoter had ethanol-inducible promoter activity. These findings suggested that the Os07g0627300 promoter could be used as a useful tool for regulating gene expression in plants and could be used to generate transgenic crops with desirable traits."
"The Putative Role of Environmental Mercury in the Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders and Subtypes  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Exposure to organic forms of mercury has the theoretical capacity to generate a range of immune abnormalities coupled with chronic nitro-oxidative stress seen in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The paper discusses possible mechanisms explaining the neurotoxic effects of mercury and possible associations between mercury exposure and ASD subtypes. Environmental mercury is neurotoxic at doses well below the current reference levels considered to be safe, with evidence of neurotoxicity in children exposed to environmental sources including fish consumption and ethylmercury-containing vaccines. Possible neurotoxic mechanisms of mercury include direct effects on sulfhydryl groups, pericytes and cerebral endothelial cells, accumulation within astrocytes, microglial activation, induction of chronic oxidative stress, activation of immune-inflammatory pathways and impairment of mitochondrial functioning. (Epi-)genetic factors which may increase susceptibility to the toxic effects of mercury in ASD include the following: a greater propensity of males to the long-term neurotoxic effects of postnatal exposure and genetic polymorphisms in glutathione transferases and other glutathione-related genes and in selenoproteins. Furthermore, immune and inflammatory responses to immunisations with mercury-containing adjuvants are strongly influenced by polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and by genes encoding effector proteins such as cytokines and pattern recognition receptors. Some epidemiological studies investigating a possible relationship between high environmental exposure to methylmercury and impaired neurodevelopment have reported a positive dose-dependent effect. Retrospective studies, on the other hand, reported no relationship between a range of ethylmercury-containing vaccines and chronic neuropathology or ASD. On the basis of these results, we would argue that more clinically relevant research is required to examine whether environmental mercury is associated with ASD or subtypes. Specific recommendations for future research are discussed."
"Lime powder treatment reduces urinary excretion of total protein and transferrin but increases uromodulin excretion in patients with urolithiasis  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Our previous study has shown that lime powder (LP) had an inhibitory effect against calcium oxalate stone formation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying such beneficial effect remained unclear. Our present study thus aimed to address the effect of LP on excretory level and compositions of urinary proteins using a proteomics approach. From a total of 80 calcium oxalate stone formers recruited into our 2-year randomized clinical trial of LP effect, 10 patients with comparable age and clinical parameters were selected for this proteomic study. 24-h urine specimens were collected from all subjects, at baseline (before) and after LP treatment for 6 months, and then subjected to quantitative proteomics analysis and subsequent validation by ELISA. Total urinary protein excretion was significantly decreased by LP treatment, but unaffected by placebo. Nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC–MS/MS) followed by quantitative analysis revealed 17 proteins whose levels were significantly altered (16 decreased and 1 increased) exclusively by LP treatment. Among these, the decrease of transferrin and increase of uromodulin were validated by ELISA. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between microalbuminuria and urinary transferrin level by Pearson’s correlation test. In summary, LP treatment caused significant reduction in total urinary protein excretion and changes in urinary protein compositions that could be linked to stone inhibitory effects and might be relevant mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of LP to prevent kidney stone formation and recurrence."
"The benefit of punishment sensitivity on motor performance under pressure  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Objective: Humans are often required to perform demanding cognitive and motor tasks under pressure. However, in such environments there is considerable interindividual variability in the ability to successfully execute actions. Here, we consider how individual differences in self-reported sensitivity to punishment influence skilled motor performance under pressure and whether this relationship is moderated by the temporal detection of threat. Method: Across two studies, 160 UK participants (Study 1: N = 80, Mage = 21.6, 52 males; Study 2: N = 80, Mage = 24.95, 45 males) performed a precision-grip task and received either early or late warning of an upcoming stressful manipulation involving social evaluation and performance-dependent incentives. Results: In both studies, we report an interaction where punishment sensitivity was adaptive for motor performance only when threats were detected early and there was opportunity to prepare for the upcoming stressor. Further, our results suggest that the benefits of punishment sensitivity are likely underpinned by the effective use of cognitive strategies. Conclusion: Heightened sensitivity to punishment is adaptive for performance under pressure, provided threats are detected early and effective cognitive strategies are implemented."
"Protective Effects of Cell-Free Supernatant and Live Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from Thai Pigs Against a Pandemic Strain of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus  2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus which causes severe diarrhea and fatal dehydration in piglets. In general, probiotic supplements could enhance recovery and protect piglets against enteric pathogens. Seven local lactic acid bacteria (LAB), (Ent. faecium 79N and 40N, Lact. plantarum 22F, 25F and 31F, Ped. acidilactici 72N and Ped. pentosaceus 77F) from pig feces were well-characterized as high potential probiotics. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) and live LAB were evaluated for antiviral activities by co-incubation on Vero cells and challenged with a pandemic strain of PEDV isolated from pigs in Thailand. Cell survival and viral inhibition were determined by cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay and confirmed by immunofluorescence. At 1:16, CFS dilution (pH 6.3–6.8) showed no cytotoxicity in Vero cells and was therefore used as the dilution for antiviral assays. The diluted CFS of all Lact. plantarum showed the antiviral effect against PEDV; however, the same antiviral effect could not be observed in Ent. faecium and Pediococcus strains. In competitive experiment, only live Lact. plantarum 25F and Ped. pentosaceus 77F showed CPE reduction in the viral infected cells to <50% observed field area. This study concluded that the CFS of all tested lactobacilli, and live Lact. plantarum (22F and 25F) and Pediococcus strains 72N and 77F could reduce infectivity of the pandemic strain of PEDV from pigs in Thailand on the target Vero cells."
"Influence of Hydrogen on Catalytic Properties of Ziegler-Natta Catalysts Prepared by Different Methods in Ethylene Polymerization  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Ethylene homopolymerization by two types of Ziegler-Natta catalyst including ZN-THF and ZN-EtOH catalysts was compared. The influences of hydrogen pressure and reaction time on catalytic activity using different types of catalyst were investigated. The EDX analysis and surface area measurement confirmed that ZN-EtOH catalyst had better active center distribution than that of ZN-THF. Thus, the ZN-EtOH catalyst could retard the effect of hydrogen and show higher activity with increased hydrogen pressures. However, catalytic activity was lower with high hydrogen pressure. Moreover, polymerization time also has an influence on activity. Both catalysts showed the similar result where an increase in polymerization time can improve yield of polymer, but it decreased activity. In addition, it is seen that the increase in hydrogen pressure leads to decrease the melting temperature for polyethylenes, but it increases the crystallinity."
"Impact of Mixing Method on Rheological Instability for Binary Mixture of Linear Low-Density Polyethylene  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The impact of different mixing methods on flow instability in capillary extrusion was examined using binary mixtures of linear low-density polyethylene with different molecular weights. The polymers were blended using a single-screw extruder, a twin-screw extruder, and a twin-screw mixer. The onset of flow instability changed depending on the mixing method used, even though their linear viscoelastic properties were almost identical. The mixtures that were subjected to mixing methods with weak mixing capability exhibit sharkskin failure even at low shear stress and low values of the maximum draw ratio without rupture in the molten state. The results suggested that mechanically weak points were present, which led to cohesive failure at the strand surface following abrupt stretching at the die exit (i.e., sharkskin failure). In contrast, the mixture that was subjected to thorough mixing exhibited smooth surface at high shear stress and a large maximum draw ratio."
"Synchronization of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions in the tokay gecko  2018 Author(s).Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) are a universal feature of all classes of tetrapods. Although the generation mechanism of SOAEs are incompletely understood, these emissions are undoubtedly associated with the active process of the inner ear. In most lizards, unlike mammals and amphibians, robust SOAEs can ordinarily be detected from both ears. In this work, we investigated the interactions between emissions recorded simultaneously from the two ears of tokay geckos. We found that the frequency spectra of SOAEs from both ears of an individual animal are partially correlated: The peaks of several emissions occur at identical frequencies. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of these identical-frequency SOAEs, we perturbed the emissions from one or both ears by manipulating the pressure in the ear canals or by decreasing the local temperature in the vicinity of one inner ear. Suppression of SOAEs due to large positive pressures revealed that some identical-frequency emissions were generated unilaterally, whereas others were contributed by both ears at identical or slightly different frequencies. These bilaterally generated SOAEs became desynchronized as their frequency detuning grew sufficiently large, a phenomenon consistent with the synchronization of two active oscillators. Finally, we found that manipulations of the volume of the oral cavity or altering the impedance of the tympanum strongly affected the synchronization of SOAEs. These findings agreed with previous studies suggesting that the tokay gecko, like other lizards, exhibits strong acoustic coupling between its tympani through the oral cavity."

Funded by SCOAP3.A search for a heavy neutral lepton N of Majorana nature decaying into a W boson and a charged lepton is performed using the CMS detector at the LHC. The targeted signature consists of three prompt charged leptons in any flavor combination of electrons and muons. The data were collected in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The search is performed in the N mass range between 1 GeV and 1.2 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the expected standard model background. Upper limits are set on the values of |VeN|2 and |VμN|2, where V N is the matrix element describing the mixing of N with the standard model neutrino of flavor. These are the first direct limits for N masses above 500 GeV and the first limits obtained at a hadron collider for N masses below 40 GeV."
"Reforming of CO2-containing natural gas with steam in AC gliding arc discharge for hydrogen production  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.In this study, a low-temperature gliding arc discharge system was used to investigate the effects of steam content and operational parameters, i.e. total feed flow rate, applied voltage, and input frequency, on the reforming performance of CO2-containing natural gas. The addition of steam less than 10% was found to enhance both selectivities for hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a significant reduction of power consumptions. The highest hydrogen selectivity and yield with the lowest power consumptions were achieved at a steam content of 10 mol%, a total feed flow rate of 100 cm3/min (corresponding to a very short residence time of 1.37 s), an applied voltage of 13.5 kV and an input frequency of 300 Hz. Under these optimum conditions, the oxidative dehydrogenation reactions to produce hydrogen were dominant with the minimum activities of all undesired reactions of cracking and coupling. Both of the short residence time (1.37 s) with a low bulk temperature (lower than 200°C) in the plasma zone under atmospheric pressure, indicate that the studied plasma reactor (gliding arc system) is superior to conventional catalytic reactors for reforming of natural gas."
"Extension of specification language for soundness and completeness of service workflow  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.A Service Workflow is an aggregation of distributed services to fulfill specific functionalities. With ever increasing available services, the methodologies for the selections of the services against the given requirements become main research subjects in multiple disciplines. A few of researchers have contributed to the formal specification languages and the methods for model checking; however, existing methods have the difficulties to tackle with the complexity of workflow compositions. In this paper, we propose to formalize the specification language to reduce the complexity of the workflow composition. To this end, we extend a specification language with the consideration of formal logic, so that some effective theorems can be derived for the verification of syntax, semantics, and inference rules in the workflow composition. The logic-based approach automates compliance checking effectively. The Service Workflow Specification (SWSpec) has been extended and formulated, and the soundness, completeness, and consistency of SWSpec applications have been verified; note that a logic-based SWSpec is mandatory for the development of model checking. The application of the proposed SWSpec has been demonstrated by the examples with the addressed soundness, completeness, and consistency."
"Three-dimensional Frankfort horizontal plane for 3D cephalometry: A comparative assessment of conventional versus novel landmarks and horizontal planes  The Author(s) 2018.Background: To assess the reproducibility of landmarks in three dimensions that determine the Frankfort horizontal plane (FH) as well as two new landmarks, and to evaluate the angular differences of newly introduced planes to the FH. Methods: Three-dimensional (3D) surface models were created from CBCT scans of 26 dry human skulls. Porion (Po), orbitale (Or), internal acoustic foramen (IAF), and zygomatico-maxillary suture (ZyMS) were indicated in the software by three observers twice with a 4-week interval. Angles between two FHs (FH 1: Or-R, Or-L, mid-Po; FH 2: Po-R, Po-L, mid-Or) and between FHs and new planes (Plane 1-6) were measured. Coordinates were exported to a spreadsheet. A statistical analysis was performed to define the landmark reproducibility and 3D angles. Results: Intra- and inter-observer landmark reproducibility showed mean difference more than 1 mm for x-coordinates of all landmarks except IAF. IAF showed significantly better reproducibility than other landmarks (P < 0.0018). The mean angular difference between FH 1 and FH 2 was 0.7 degrees. Plane 3, connecting Or-R, Or-L and mid-IAF, and Plane 4, connecting Po-R, Po-L and mid-ZyMS, both showed an angular difference of less than 1 degree when compared to FHs. Conclusions: This study revealed poor reproducibility of the traditional FH landmarks on the x-axis and good reproducibility of a new landmark tested to replace Po, the IAF. Yet, Or showed superior results compared to ZyMS. The potential of using new horizontal planes was demonstrated. Future studies should focus on identification of a valid alternative for Or and ZyMS and on clinical implementation of the findings."
"Absolute oral bioavailability and disposition kinetics of puerarin in female rats  2018 The Author(s).Background: Pueraria candollei var. mirifica is a medicinal plant that is promoted as a ""Champion Product"" by the Government of Thailand. This plant has been reported to relieve postmenopausal symptoms, prevent and reverse bone loss, inhibit the growth of breast cancer, and alleviate cardiovascular diseases in preclinical and clinical studies. However, there is little information on the oral bioavailability and tissue distribution of puerarin with respect to its pharmacodynamic activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of puerarin, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, in rats. Moreover, this is the first study to examine the tissue distribution of puerarin in the hippocampus, femur, tibia, and mammary gland. Methods: Adult female rats were administered puerarin at 1 mg/kg intravenously or 5 and 10 mg/kg orally. Blood, tissue, urine, and feces were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Puerarin reached a maximum concentration in the blood of 140-230 μg/L within 1 h of oral dosing, and had an absolute oral bioavailability of approximately 7%. Following intravenous administration, puerarin was widely distributed in several tissues, including the hippocampus, heart, lung, stomach, liver, mammary gland, kidney, spleen, femur, and tibia. Approximately 50% of the intravenous dose was excreted as glucuronide metabolites via the urinary route. Conclusions: The absolute oral bioavailability of puerarin was approximately 7% at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. Puerarin was widely distributed to several organs related to the diseases of aging, including the hippocampus, femur, tibia, and mammary gland. Glucuronides were the major metabolites of puerarin and were mainly excreted in the urine. These results are useful for the development of puerarin and Pueraria candollei var. mirifica as phytopharmaceutical products."
"Sanctis A–C: Three Racemic Procyanidin Analogues from The Lichen Parmotrema sancti-angelii  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe phytochemical investigation of the lichen Parmotrema sancti-angelii afforded three racemic compounds, sanctis A–C, which feature an original dibenzo-2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane scaffold. These compounds were structurally characterized by extensive NMR spectroscopy analyses, comparison between experimental and theoretical NMR spectroscopic data, and X-ray crystallography. These metabolites are similar to procyanidin A and display a methyl group instead of a pendant aromatic ring at C-9, a so far unprecedented structural feature. A biosynthetic route to sanctis A–C is proposed."
"Accuracy of axial length measurements obtained by optical biometry and acoustic biometry in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: A prospective study  2018 Pongsachareonnont and Tangjanyatam.Purpose: We compared the accuracy of axial length (AL) measurement obtained by optical biometry with that obtained by acoustic biometry in eyes with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Patients and methods: This prospective descriptive analytic study measured the AL of eyes with RRD preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively using optical biometry (intraocular lens [IOL] master group) and acoustic biometry (immersion A-scan group). Preoperative and postoperative measurements were compared by paired t-test. The agreement between preoperative and postoperative measurements was analyzed using a Bland-Altman plot. Subgroup analysis of macular involvement status was performed. Results: Twenty-seven eyes were analyzed in this study. The mean AL in the IOL master group was 23.58±0.97 mm preoperatively and 24.17±1.16 mm postoperatively; the mean difference was -0.59±0.90 mm (P = 0.007). The mean AL in the immersion A-scan group was 24.29±1.59 mm preoperatively and 24.27±1.69 mm postoperatively; the mean difference was 0.02±0.48 mm (P = 0.827). Bland-Altman analysis revealed disagreement between preoperative and postoperative AL measurements in both techniques. In subgroup analysis of macula with RRD, there were significant differences between preoperative and postoperative AL measurements in the IOL master group (P = 0.014). Conclusion: Significant underestimation of AL measurement was observed when using the IOL master in eyes with RRD with macular involvement, which could affect IOL power selection."
"Using a Distributed Roadside Unit for the Data Dissemination Protocol in VANET with the Named Data Architecture  2018 IEEE.Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) has recently become one of the highly active research areas for wireless networking. Since VANET is a multi-hop wireless network with very high mobility and intermittent connection lifetime, it is important to effectively handle the data dissemination issue in this rapidly changing environment. However, the existing TCP/IP implementation may not fit into such a highly dynamic environment because the nodes in the network must often perform rerouting due to their inconsistency of connectivity. In addition, the drivers in the vehicles may want to acquire some data, but they do not know the address/location of such data storage. Hence, the named data networking (NDN) approach may be more desirable here. The NDN architecture is proposed for the future Internet, which focuses on the delivering mechanism based on the message contents instead of relying on the host addresses of the data. In this paper, a new protocol named roadside unit (RSU) assisted of named data network (RA-NDN) is presented. The RSU can operate as a standalone node [standalone RSU (SA-RSU)]. One benefit of deploying SA-RSUs is the improved network connectivity. This study uses the NS3 and SUMO software packages for the network simulator and traffic simulator software, respectively, to verify the performance of the RA-NDN protocol. To reduce the latency under various vehicular densities, vehicular transmission ranges, and number of requesters, the proposed approach is compared with vehicular NDN via a real-world data set in the urban area of Sathorn road in Bangkok, Thailand. The simulation results show that the RA-NDN protocol improves the performance of ad hoc communications with the increase in data received ratio and throughput and the decrease in total dissemination time and traffic load."
"Sorption characteristics of cadmium in a clay soil of Mae Ku creek, Tak Province, Thailand  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Mae Sot is a district in Tak province, the northern part of Thailand where has encountered with cadmium (Cd) contaminated in soils. Exposure of Cd can lead to severe health effect, for examples, bone softening, osteoporosis, renal dysfunction, and Itai-Itai disease. This study aims at elucidating sorption behavior of Cd in the contaminated soil collected from Mae Ku creek, Mae Sot district, Thailand. Batch sorption experiment was conducted in order to investigate sorption characteristics of Cd onto the contaminated soil. The soil sample taken from the study area consists of 26% sand, 16% silt 58% clay, which categorized as a clay soil, based on USDA classification. Soil pH is slightly alkaline (pH∼7.7) and organic matter in the soil is 2.93%. The initial concentration in the batch sorption experiment was in the range from 0- 200 ppm. The result from the batch sorption experiment showed that soil sample can adsorb Cd up to 173.5 ppm and the sorption behavior of the soil sample can be well described by Freundlich isotherm, indicating the multilayer sorption (R2 = 0.9964), with Freundlich constants of 0.312 and 1.760 L g-1 for 1/n and Kf, respectively."
"Dust attenuation in 2 < z < 3 star-forming galaxies from deep ALMA observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field  2018 The Author(s).We present the results of a new study of the relationship between infrared excess (IRX ≡ LIR/LUV), ultraviolet (UV) spectral slope (β) and stellar mass at redshifts 2 < z < 3, based on a deep Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3-mm continuum mosaic of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Excluding the most heavily obscured sources, we use a stacking analysis to show that z ≃ 2.5 star-forming galaxies in the mass range 9.25 ≤ log(M*/M⊙) ≤ 10.75 are fully consistent with the IRX-β relation expected for a relatively grey attenuation curve, similar to the commonly adopted Calzetti law. Based on a large, mass-complete sample of 2 ≤ z ≤ 3 star-forming galaxies drawn frommultiple surveys, we proceed to derive a new empirical relationship between β and stellar mass, making it possible to predict UV attenuation (A1600) and IRX as a function of stellar mass, for any assumed attenuation law. Once again, we find that z ≃ 2.5 star-forming galaxies follow A1600-M* and IRX-M* relations consistent with a relatively grey attenuation law, and find no compelling evidence that star-forming galaxies at this epoch follow a reddening law as steep as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve. In fact, we use a simple simulation to demonstrate that previous determinations of the IRX-β relation may have been biased towards low values of IRX at red values of β, mimicking the signature expected for an SMC-like dust law. We show that this provides a plausible mechanism for reconciling apparently contradictory results in the literature and that, based on typical measurement uncertainties, stellar mass provides a cleaner prediction of UV attenuation than β. Although the situation at lower stellar masses remains uncertain, we conclude that for 2 < z < 3 star-forming galaxies with log(M*/M⊙) ≥ 9.75, both the IRX-β and IRX-M* relations are well described by a Calzetti-like attenuation law."
"Revolutionizing Our Understanding of AGN Feedback and its Importance to Galaxy Evolution in the Era of the Next Generation Very Large Array  2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..Energetic feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) plays an important evolutionary role in the regulation of star formation on galactic scales. However, the effects of this feedback as a function of redshift and galaxy properties such as mass, environment, and cold gas content remain poorly understood. The broad frequency coverage (1 to 116 GHz), high sensitivity (up to ten times higher than the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array), and superb angular resolution (maximum baselines of at least a few hundred kilometers) of the proposed next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) are uniquely poised to revolutionize our understanding of AGNs and their role in galaxy evolution. Here, we provide an overview of the science related to AGN feedback that will be possible in the ngVLA era and present new continuum ngVLA imaging simulations of resolved radio jets spanning a wide range of intrinsic extents. We also consider key computational challenges and discuss exciting opportunities for multiwavelength synergy with other next-generation instruments, such as the Square Kilometer Array and the James Webb Space Telescope. The unique combination of high-resolution, large collecting area, and wide frequency range will enable significant advancements in our understanding of the effects of jet-driven feedback on sub-galactic scales, particularly for sources with extents of a few parsec to a few kiloparsec, such as young and/or lower-power radio AGNs, AGNs hosted by low-mass galaxies, radio jets that are interacting strongly with the interstellar medium of the host galaxy, and AGNs at high redshift."
"Stability enhancement of mulberry-extracted anthocyanin using alginate/chitosan microencapsulation for food supplement application  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The stability of mulberry-extracted anthocyanin is a main concern in food supplement application. In this article, the alginate/chitosan beads were fabricated by spray drying and external gelation techniques using different processes: (1) dropping a sodium alginate solution into a CaCl2 solution containing chitosan and (2) incubating calcium alginate beads in a solution of chitosan. These beads were introduced as microcarrier to enhance the stability and bioavailability of anthocyanin. We showed that the beads fabricated by different processes could encapsulate the anthocyanin at different amounts. All alginate/chitosan beads had high swelling percentage under pH 6 and 7.4 but not completely swell at pH 1 and 4. The alginate/chitosan beads degraded in a simulated gastric fluid condition (SGF) in the faster rate than that in a simulated intestinal fluid condition (SIF). Under SGF condition, the release of anthocyanin seemed to be governed by electrostatic interaction while the release of anthocyanin under SIF condition may be manipulated by the beads’ degradation. Herein, we showed that the beads produced by incubating calcium alginate beads in 0.05% chitosan solution were the most appropriate microcarriers for encapsulation of mulberry-extracted anthocyanin which showed high encapsulation efficiency and had resistance to gastric condition."
"Bearing capacity of shallow foundations in clay with linear increase in strength and adhesion factor  2017 Taylor & Francis.In this paper, the computational lower bound (LB) limit analysis using finite element with second-order cone programming was used to investigate the LB solutions of the undrained bearing capacity of continuous footing with a linear increase in the strength profile and an adhesion factor at the soil–footing interface. A full range of parametric studies of the dimensionless strength gradients and adhesion factors at the soil–footing interface were performed in the LB calculations. The results were verified by comparison with the available solution from the method of characteristics (slip-line analysis) for perfectly smooth and rough footings. The LB analyses were able to complete a prior solution of undrained bearing capacity with a linear increase in the strength profile by incorporating the influence of adhesion factor at the soil–footing interface. Based on the nonlinear regression to the computed LB solutions, an approximate expression of the LB solution regression was proposed, which is applicable to an accurate prediction of a safe load for offshore shallow foundations in clay with an arbitrary linear increase in strength and adhesion factor at soil–foundation interface in practice."
"Search for the X (5568) State Decaying into Bs0 π± in Proton-Proton Collisions at s =8 TeV  2018 CERN.A search for resonancelike structures in the Bs0π± invariant mass spectrum is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at s=8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb-1. The Bs0 mesons are reconstructed in the decay chain Bs0→J/ψφ, with J/ψ→μ+μ- and φ→K+K-. The Bs0π± invariant mass distribution shows no statistically significant peaks for different selection requirements on the reconstructed Bs0 and π± candidates. Upper limits are set on the relative production rates of the X(5568) and Bs0 states times the branching fraction of the decay X(5568)±→Bs0π±. In addition, upper limits are obtained as a function of the mass and the natural width of possible exotic states decaying into Bs0π±."
"Exploring bedroom usability and accessibility in Parkinson'S disease (PD): The utility of a PD home safety questionnaire and implications for adaptations  2018 Bhidayasiri, Jitkritsadakul, Sringean, Jantanapornchai, Kantachadvanich, Phumphid, Boonpang, Pensook, Aungkab, Hattori and Chaudhuri.Background: Although bedrooms are identified as a major location for accidents among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, there are no studies that specifically evaluate the bedroom environments of PD patients. Objective: To examine the physical bedroom environment of patients with PD by generating a home safety questionnaire to rate bedroom accessibility and usability specifically for PD patients, and piloting it in a small set of PD patients, to identify environmental barriers and recommend adaptations to reduce accident risks. Methods: Questionnaire development was based on the concept of Personal (P)-Environmental (E) fit. The P component covers five clinical domains that contribute to a patients' current state of health, including PD-related motor symptoms, PD-related non-motor symptoms, gait and balance impairments, comorbidities, and limitations on specific activities. The E component focuses on both indoor (bedroom, bathroom, living room, stairs, and kitchen), and outdoor (outdoor area and entrance) areas within a home where PD patients commonly get injured. Total score for the whole questionnaire is 171. A higher score indicates more P-E problems. Results: Comprehension of questions was tested for content validity with an item-objective congruence index of above 0.6 for all items. High internal consistency (reliability) was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.828 (r). The pilot in five PD patients gave a mean total score of 48.2 ± 7.29 with a mean score on personal and environmental components of 16.8 ± 5.12 and 31.4 ± 4.51, respectively. Conclusion: This PD home safety questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument for examining P-E problems by a multidisciplinary team during their home visits. More studies, involving a large number of PD patients, are needed to establish its utility as a screening instrument in PD patients to assess for home adaptations."
"Measurement of Prompt D0 Meson Azimuthal Anisotropy in Pb-Pb Collisions at sNN =5.02 TeV  2018 CERN.for the CMS Collaboration. Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the »https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/» Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI.The prompt D0 meson azimuthal anisotropy coefficients, v2 and v3, are measured at midrapidity (|y|<1.0) in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy sNN=5.02 TeV per nucleon pair with data collected by the CMS experiment. The measurement is performed in the transverse momentum (pT) range of 1 to 40 GeV/c, for central and midcentral collisions. The v2 coefficient is found to be positive throughout the pT range studied. The first measurement of the prompt D0 meson v3 coefficient is performed, and values up to 0.07 are observed for pT around 4 GeV/c. Compared to measurements of charged particles, a similar pT dependence, but smaller magnitude for pT<6 GeV/c, is found for prompt D0 meson v2 and v3 coefficients. The results are consistent with the presence of collective motion of charm quarks at low pT and a path length dependence of charm quark energy loss at high pT, thereby providing new constraints on the theoretical description of the interactions between charm quarks and the quark-gluon plasma."
"Driver identification using histogram and neural network from acceleration data  2017 IEEE.Sensor technology has continuously improved in term of size and cost. It encourages car companies to embed various types of sensors in their cars. The most common sensors that can be found are location sensor and acceleration sensor. The sensors generate a lot of useful data which could be applied for many future applications such as car tracking or emergency warning. One of the most interesting applications among others is analyzing the driver behavior. There are some previous works using this information to define types of drivers that are related to levels of accident risk. However, the driver behavior not only can separate the type of drivers but also can identify driving characteristic of an individual driver. The driver identification benefits a security application and it can eliminate the global car theft issue. Because the driver behavior cannot be repeated or copied like other anti-theft systems so this is an essential solution to stop increasing the number of stolen cars every year. In this paper, we propose a methodology to identify each driver and classify group of drivers using only accelerating behavior with machine learning technique. In order to identify an individual driver, the acceleration data have been transformed to a histogram in order to represent the accelerating behavior then we utilize a neural network model. We evaluate our methodology with data that have been collected from the acceleration sensors installed on 13 shuttle buses in our campus for more than 10 months. The results show the accuracy of the proposed methodology up to 88.3% for driver identification and up to 92% for driver classification."
"A study of vehicular desynchronization for platooning application  2017 IEEE.Platooning is a challenging application because it requires a frequent rate of beaconing. Performance of traditional Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance method (CSMA/CA) on IEEE 802.11p is unable to satisfy for platooning needs due to unbounded delay especially under high channel load. Several researches about platooning are involved with medium access control (MAC) layer modification in a protocol stack and/or does not support variable number of vehicles and/or have a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose to use a vehicular desynchronization TDMA-based protocol over off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11p, while supporting vehicles joining and leaving a platoon and having no single point of failure. We recommend a range of parameters that are suitable for the platooning application. Our evaluation shows that using our suggested parameters, the vehicular desynchronization protocol could support a high-frequency beaconing with up to 16 vehicles at 100 Hz beaconing."
"Neuroprotective effect of a standardized extract of Centella asiatica ECa233 in rotenone-induced parkinsonism rats  2018 Elsevier GmbHBackground: Mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation cause dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. The neuroprotective approach is a promising strategy to slow disease progression in Parkinson's disease. A standardized extract of Centella asiatica ECa233 has been previously reported to have pharmacological effects in the central nervous system. Purpose: This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective effect and mechanisms of ECa233 in rotenone-induced parkinsonism rats. Methods: Rats were orally given either vehicle or ECa233 (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) for 20 consecutive days. Rotenone (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) was given to parkinsonism (PD) and ECa-treated rats from day 15 to 20. Locomotor activity was recorded on day 1, 14, 17 and 20. Tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunohistological staining was used to determine dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. Furthermore, mitochondrial complex I activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase protein expression were measured in brain tissue. Results: Rats receiving ECa233 30 mg/kg showed a significant increase in distances (p < 0.01) together with a higher number and intensity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum (p < 0.001) compared to PD rats. ECa233 (30 mg/kg) protected against mitochondrial complex I inhibition, decreased MDA levels (p < 0.05) and increased SOD (p < 0.01) and catalase (p < 0.05) expression. Conclusion: ECa233 can protect against rotenone-induced motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal death. These effects are mediated through the protection of mitochondrial complex I activity, the effects of antioxidants and the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme expression."
"No neurocognitive advantage for immediate antiretroviral treatment in adults with greater than 500 CD4+ T-cell counts  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Objective: To compare the effect of immediate versus deferred antiretroviral treatment (ART) on neuropsychological test performance in treatment-naive HIV-positive adults with more than 500 CD4 + cells/μl. Design: Randomized trial. Methods: The START parent study randomized participants to commence immediate versus deferred ART until CD4 + less than 350 cells/μl. The START Neurology substudy used eight neuropsychological tests, at baseline, months 4, 8, 12 and annually, to compare groups for changes in test performance. Test results were internally standardized to z-scores. The primary outcome was the average of the eight test z-scores (QNPZ-8). Mean changes in QNPZ-8 from baseline were compared by intent-to-treat using longitudinal mixed models. Changes from baseline to specific time points were compared using ANCOVA models. Results: The 592 participants had a median age of 34 years; median baseline CD4 + count was 629 cells/μl; the mean follow-up was 3.4 years. ART was used for 94 and 32% of accrued person-years in the immediate and deferred groups, respectively. There was no difference between the immediate and deferred ART groups in QNPZ-8 change through follow-up [-0.018 (95% CI -0.062 to 0.027, P = 0.44)], or at any visit. However, QNPZ-8 scores increased in both arms during the first year, by 0.22 and 0.24, respectively (P < 0.001 for increase from baseline). Conclusion: We observed substantial improvement in neurocognitive test performance during the first year in both study arms, underlining the importance of using a control group in studies assessing neurocognitive performance over time. Immediate ART neither benefitted nor harmed neurocognitive performance in individuals with CD4 + cell counts above 500 cells/μl."
"Analysis of cosmetic residues on a single human hair by ATR FT-IR microspectroscopy  2018 Elsevier B.V.In this work, ATR FT-IR spectra of single human hair and cosmetic residues on hair surface are successfully collected using a homemade dome-shaped Ge μIRE accessary installed on an infrared microscope. By collecting ATR spectra of hairs from the same person, the spectral patterns are identical and superimposed while different spectral features are observed from ATR spectra of hairs collected from different persons. The spectral differences depend on individual hair characteristics, chemical treatments, and cosmetics on hair surface. The “Contact-and-Collect” technique that transfers remarkable materials on the hair surface to the tip of the Ge μIRE enables an identification of cosmetics on a single hair. Moreover, the differences between un-split and split hairs are also studied in this report. These highly specific spectral features can be employed for unique identification or for differentiation of hairs based on the molecular structures of hairs and cosmetics on hairs."
"Effect of Bi2O3 on gamma ray shielding and structural properties of borosilicate glasses recycled from high pressure sodium lamp glass  2018 Elsevier B.V.The borosilicate glass was recycled from high pressure sodium lamp glass (HPSg) and investigated as a starting material for radiation shielding glass. Bi2O3 was expected to improve radiation shielding properties of the glass samples. Mass attenuation coefficients, effective atomic number (Zeff) and effective electron density (Ne) of the glass samples ((80 – x)HPSg – (20)Na2O – (x)Bi2O3 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mol%) were determined at different photon energies. The energy absorption buildup factor (EABF) and fast neutron removal cross sections were also calculated for the given materials. The results clearly revealed that mass attenuation coefficient and other parameters depends on concentration of Bi2O3 and addition of Bi2O3 significantly increased shielding capability of glass samples against gamma rays as well as fast neutrons. The results of Zeff and Ne confirmed the ability of shielding of the glass samples with Bi2O3 as well. Physical properties of glass samples were also investigated in the present work. The obtained ultrasonic velocities and Young's modulus of the glass samples led us to a conclusion that the network structures of the glass are loss of compact structures due to creation of NBOs when adding the Bi2O3. The FTIR measurements confirmed NBOs forming in the network structures of the glass samples with increase of Bi2O3 contents. The reported structural and radiation attenuation properties of recycled glass with Bi2O3 should be important in radiation shielding applications which requires high strength of structures at the same time."
"Petrochemistry and zircon U-Pb geochronology of granitic rocks in the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand: Implications for petrogenesis and tectonic setting  2017 Elsevier LtdCarboniferous biotite granite, Late Permian hornblende granite, and Triassic biotite-hornblende granite, all of which belong to the Eastern Granite Belt, expose in the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, northeastern Thailand. The Carboniferous biotite granite is dominated by quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, and biotite. The Late Permian hornblende granite contains dominant assemblages of plagioclase, quartz, K-feldspar, hornblende, and minor amount of biotite, while the Triassic biotite-hornblende granite consists of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar with small amounts of biotite, and hornblende. The REE patterns with steep decrease from light to heavy REE together with the LILE (e.g. K, Sr) enrichment and depletion of some particular HFSE (e.g. Nb, Ti) indicate low degree of partial melting. Mineral chemistry of biotite and hornblende in the granites reflects crystallization from hydrous calc-alkaline arc-derived magmas possibly formed by subduction. Amphibole-plagioclase thermometry and Al-in-hornblende barometry indicate that the Late Permian hornblende granite and the Triassic biotite-hornblende granite may have equilibrated at 3.0–5.8 kbar/700–820 °C and 2.0–3.2 kbar/600–750 °C, respectively, in the middle-upper crust (about 10–15 km depth). Zircon U-Pb geochronology of the Carboniferous biotite granite, Late Permian hornblende granite and Triassic biotite-hornblende granite yielded intrusion ages of 314.6–284.9 Ma, 253.4 Ma, and 237.8 Ma, respectively, which implies multiple episodes of arc-magmatism formed by Palaeo-Tethys subduction beneath Indochina Terrane during Late Carboniferous/Early Permian, Late Permian and Middle Triassic."
"When art meets mall: impact on shopper responses  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the role of artistic elements in a shopping mall’s experiential marketing strategy and the effects of artistic elements on customer shopping value (e.g. utilitarian, hedonic and symbolic) and shopper response (e.g. satisfaction, behavioural intention). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 300 shoppers in a shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand. A partial least square-structural equation model was used to examine the impact of the artistic elements along with other elements in the shopping mall on shopper response through perceived shopping value. Findings: Empirical evidence shows that artistic elements in an artified mall have a positive effect on customer hedonic and symbolic value, which in turn leads to positive shopper response. Artistic elements perform better than other elements in predicting symbolic value. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that artistic elements should be considered a new source of mall differentiation and customer experience enhancement. Unique artistic elements add emotional and symbolic appeal to the mall, and mall managers should carefully choose artistic content that matches the position and target shoppers of their mall. Originality/value: This paper proposed and empirically examined the effect of artistic elements as the new fourth atmospheric element. It extends the art infusion theory by applying it to the “non-luxury” shopping mall context to demonstrate the spillover effect of art on shopping value, which further influence shopper response."
"Immediate effects of temporary bite-raising with light-cured orthodontic band cement on the electromyographic response of masticatory muscles To assess the immediate effects of temporary bite-raising using light-cured orthodontic band cement on the superficial masseter and anterior temporalis electromyography (EMG) activity in healthy adults. Surface EMG signals were recorded bilaterally from the superficial masseter and anterior temporalis muscles of 30 volunteers with a normal occlusion, before and after having temporary bite-raising. The bite-raising was done by adding light-cured orthodontic band cement (3x5x2 mm WxLxH) on the lingual cusps of both upper first molars. The measurements were recorded (i) at rest, (ii) while clenching in centric occluding position and (iii) while chewing on an artificial test food. The EMG activity at rest and during clenching, the maximum voltage, and the duration of the identified EMG signal burst while chewing the artificial test food before and after temporary bite-raising were statistically compared using the paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test based on the normality of the variables. The significance level was set at 5%. After temporary bite-raising, we found no significant change in integral EMG activity at rest position for the superficial masseter (mean difference (MD)=7.5 μVs) and for the anterior temporalis muscle (MD=36.8 μVs); however, the integral EMG activity during clenching was significantly reduced for the superficial masseter (MD=201.2 μVs) and for the anterior temporalis muscle (MD=151.8 μVs). During mastication, the maximum voltage of the identified burst was significantly reduced on the preferred chewing side of the superficial masseter and anterior temporalis muscles (MD=127.9 and 47.7 μV, respectively), while no significant change was found for the duration of the identified burst (MD=-34.1 and 3.4 ms, respectively) after temporary bite-raising. The results point to an altered neuromuscular behavior during clenching and chewing immediately after temporary bite-raising with light-cured orthodontic band cement. This information is relevant for orthodontists to inform their patients what will happen to their masticatory muscle activity when this bite-raising method is used."
"Search for Narrow Resonances in the b -Tagged Dijet Mass Spectrum in Proton-Proton Collisions at s =8 TeV  2018 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.A search for narrow resonances decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs is presented, using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at s=8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb-1. The search is extended to masses lower than those reached in typical searches for resonances decaying into jet pairs at the LHC, by taking advantage of triggers that identify jets originating from bottom quarks. No significant excess of events is observed above the background predictions. Limits are set on the product of cross section and branching fraction to bottom quarks for spin 0, 1, and 2 resonances in the mass range of 325-1200 GeV. These results improve on the limits for resonances decaying into jet pairs in the 325-500 GeV mass range."
"Reduction by enhanced coagulation of dissolved organic nitrogen as a precursor of N-nitrosodimethylamine  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Raw water from the Banglen (BL) water treatment plant (WTP) and Bangkhen (BK) WTP in central Thailand and Hatyai (HY) WTP in southern Thailand was investigated for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) reduction. The DON(mg N/L) and the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)/DON ratio were 0.34 and 21, 0.24 and 18, and 1.12 and 3 for the raw waters from BL, BK, and HY WTPs, respectively. Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) dosages of 150, 80, and 40 mg/L at pH 7 were the optimal coagulation conditions for the raw waters from BL, BK, and HY WTPs, respectively, and could reduce DON by 50%, 42%, and 42%, respectively. PACl and powder activated carbon (PAC, both in mg/L) at 150 and 20, 80 and 20, and 40 and 60 could reduce DON in the raw waters from BL, BK, and HY WTPs by 71%, 67%, and 29%, respectively. DOC/DON values of water treated with PACl were similar to those of raw water. DOC/DON values of water treated with PACl and PAC were lower than those of raw water. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potentials of raw water, water treated with PACl, or both PACl and PAC, and organic fractions of BL, BK, and HY WTPs were below the detection limits of 542 and 237 ng/L, respectively. Reductions in fluorescence intensities of tryptophan-like substances at peaks 240/350 and 280/350 (nmEx/nmEm) were moderately (correlation coefficient, R = 0.85 and 0.86) and fairly (R = 0.59, 0.67, and 0.75) correlated with DON reduction."
"Whole Mitochondrial Genomic and Y-Chromosomal Phylogenies of Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque (Macaca fascicularis aurea) Suggest Ancient Hybridization between fascicularis and sinica Species Groups  The American Genetic Association. 2018. All rights reserved.Macaca fascicularis aurea(Burmese long-tailed macaque) is 1 of the 10 subspecies ofMacaca fascicularis. Despite having few morphological differences from other subspecies, a recent phylogeographic study showed that M. f. aurea is clearly distinct genetically from Macaca fascicularis fascicularis (common long-tailed macaque) and suggests that M. f. aurea experienced a disparate evolutionary pathway versus other subspecies. To construct a detailed evolutionary history of M. f. aurea and its relationships with other macaque species, we performed phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimation of whole mitochondrial genomes (2 M. f. aurea, 8 M. f. fascicularis, and 16 animals of 12 macaque species) and 2871 bp of the Y chromosome (1 M. f. aurea, 2 M. f. fascicularis, and 5 animals of 5 macaque species) and haplotype network analysis of 758 bp of the Y chromosome (1 M. f. aurea, 2 M. f. fascicularis, and 21 animals of 19 macaque species). Whereas the Y chromosome of M. f. aurea clustered with those of the fascicularis species group in the phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses, its mtDNA clustered within the clade of the sinica species group. Based on this phylogenetic incongruence and the estimated divergence times, we propose that proto-M. f. aurea underwent hybridization with a population of the sinica species group between 2.5 and 0.95 MYA after divergence from the common ancestor of M. fascicularis. Hybridization and introgression might have been central in the evolution of M. f. aurea, similar to what occurred in the evolution of other macaque species and subspecies."
"High temperature multidimensional gas chromatographic approach for improved separation of triacylglycerols in olive oil  2018 Elsevier B.V.Heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatographic (H/C MDGC) methods under suitable flow and high temperature (T) program conditions were developed to separate olive oil triacylglycerols (TAGs). Different column sets were selected for further evaluation, each with relatively short non-polar first dimension (1D) and mid-polar second dimension (2D) columns of high T limits (350 °C). The 1D separation displayed three major groups of peaks in an area ratio of approximately 5:33:62 (of increasing retention), using flame ionisation detection (FID). Four groups of minor peaks, with 2 of them located between the major peaks, were also detected. The H/C fractions of the minor peaks, and sub-sampled regions across the major peaks eluting from the 1D outlet, were cryotrapped at the 2D inlet. The trapped TAGs then underwent temperature programmed 2D separation. Each of the ‘H/C’ zones generally gave 2–5 – and in some cases more – separated peaks of TAGs on the 2D column, under suitable flow condition and phase polarity that resulted in improved separation. Six sub-sampled H/Cs from various regions of the individual peaks from the 1D column were simultaneously trapped and released to 2D, resulting in apparently more than 22 individual TAG peaks. According to their different retention times, different TAGs were revealed within each of the 3 major groups, using H/C sub-sampling. A comprehensive sampling strategy that covers most of the 1D peaks further revealed the presence of more TAGs in the olive oil sample. This tandem column strategy was able to resolve more components than that usually observed on a single column."

"Architrypethelium murisporum (Ascomycota, Trypetheliaceae), a remarkable new lichen species from Thailand challenging ascospore septation as an indicator of phylogenetic relationships Copyright T. Luangsuphabool et al.Architrypethelium murisporum Luangsuphabool, Lumbsch & Sangvichien is described for a crustose lichen occurring in dry evergreen forest in Thailand. It is characterised by a green to yellow-green corticated thallus, perithecia fused in black pseudostromata with white rim surrounding the ostiole and small, hyaline and muriform ascospores. Currently, all species in the genus Architrypethelium have transversely septate ascospores, hence the discovery of this new species indicates that ascospore septation is variable within the genus, similar to numerous other groups of lichen-forming ascomycetes. Phylogenetic analyses of two loci (mtSSU and nuLSU) supported the position of the new species within Architrypethelium. This is the first report of the genus in Southeast Asia."
"A retrospective study of bovine tuberculosis at the municipal abattoir of Bauchi State, Northeastern Nigeria  Jajere, et al.Background and Aim: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) still remains a major zoonotic bacterial disease affecting livestock and humans worldwide. The disease remains a poorly managed tropical disease in most developing countries of the world; where in addition to productivity losses and significance in international trade, it posed a major public health threat to both humans and animals. A retrospective study was designed to investigate the occurrence of bTB lesions at Bauchi municipal abattoir. Materials and Methods: The study utilized abattoir records spanning a period of 10 years (2004-2013). The records indicated that a total of 1,08,638 heads of cattle comprising n = 56,070 males and n = 52,570 females were slaughtered at the municipal abattoir during the study period. Result: Of these heads, n = 1230 (1.13%) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.19) had tuberculous lesions. The annual occurrence during the study period varied significantly (p < 0.001) from 0.53% (95% CI: 0.40, 0.67) to 1.87% (95% CI: 1.66, 2.10) in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Females had a significantly higher (p < 0.001) prevalence of 2.10% (95% CI: 1.98, 2.23) compared with the males 0.23% (95% CI: 0.19, 0.27). The distribution of suspected gross bTB lesions in different organs showed 11.87% in the lungs, 5.93% in the liver, 1.14% in the heart, and 0.49% accounted for generalized bTB. However, none was observed on the lymph nodes and intestines. Conclusion: It can be concluded that bTB persists in Bauchi State with annual variations during the study period. This study highlights the importance of meat inspection as an important tool for detecting the presence of bTB lesions."
"CAR T cell therapy for breast cancer: Harnessing the tumor milieu to drive T cell activation  2018 The Author(s).Background: The adoptive transfer of T cells redirected to tumor via chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has produced clinical benefits for the treatment of hematologic diseases. To extend this approach to breast cancer, we generated CAR T cells directed against mucin1 (MUC1), an aberrantly glycosylated neoantigen that is overexpressed by malignant cells and whose expression has been correlated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, to protect our tumor-targeted cells from the elevated levels of immune-inhibitory cytokines present in the tumor milieu, we co-expressed an inverted cytokine receptor linking the IL4 receptor exodomain with the IL7 receptor endodomain (4/7ICR) in order to transform the suppressive IL4 signal into one that would enhance the anti-tumor effects of our CAR T cells at the tumor site. Methods: First (1G - CD3ζ) and second generation (2G - 41BB.CD3ζ) MUC1-specific CARs were constructed using the HMFG2 scFv. Following retroviral transduction transgenic expression of the CAR±ICR was assessed by flow cytometry. In vitro CAR/ICR T cell function was measured by assessing cell proliferation and short- and long-term cytotoxic activity using MUC1+ MDA MB 468 cells as targets. In vivo anti-tumor activity was assessed using IL4-producing MDA MB 468 tumor-bearing mice using calipers to assess tumor volume and bioluminescence imaging to track T cells. Results: In the IL4-rich tumor milieu, 1G CAR.MUC1 T cells failed to expand or kill MUC1+ tumors and while co-expression of the 4/7ICR promoted T cell expansion, in the absence of co-stimulatory signals the outgrowing cells exhibited an exhausted phenotype characterized by PD-1 and TIM3 upregulation and failed to control tumor growth. However, by co-expressing 2G CAR.MUC1 (signal 1 - activation + signal 2 - co-stimulation) and 4/7ICR (signal 3 - cytokine), transgenic T cells selectively expanded at the tumor site and produced potent and durable tumor control in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of targeting breast cancer using transgenic T cells equipped to thrive in the suppressive tumor milieu and highlight the importance of providing transgenic T cells with signals that recapitulate physiologic TCR signaling - [activation (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2) and cytokine support (signal 3)] - to promote in vivo persistence and memory formation."
"Evidence for the Higgs boson decay to a bottom quark–antiquark pair  2018 The Author(s)A search for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson (H) decaying to bb‾ when produced in association with an electroweak vector boson is reported for the following processes: Z(νν)H, W(μν)H, W(eν)H, Z(μμ)H, and Z(ee)H. The search is performed in data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1 at s=13TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC during Run 2 in 2016. An excess of events is observed in data compared to the expectation in the absence of a H→bb‾ signal. The significance of this excess is 3.3 standard deviations, where the expectation from SM Higgs boson production is 2.8. The signal strength corresponding to this excess, relative to that of the SM Higgs boson production, is 1.2±0.4. When combined with the Run 1 measurement of the same processes, the signal significance is 3.8 standard deviations with 3.8 expected. The corresponding signal strength, relative to that of the SM Higgs boson, is 1.06−0.29 +0.31."
"Search for new long-lived particles at s=13 TeV  2018 The Author(s)A search for long-lived particles was performed with data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb−1 collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS experiment in 2015. The analysis exploits two customized topological trigger algorithms, and uses the multiplicity of displaced jets to search for the presence of a signal decay occurring at distances between 1 and 1000 mm. The results can be interpreted in a variety of different models. For pair-produced long-lived particles decaying to two b quarks and two leptons with equal decay rates between lepton flavors, cross sections larger than 2.5 fb are excluded for proper decay lengths between 70–100 mm for a long-lived particle mass of 1130 GeV at 95% confidence. For a specific model of pair-produced, long-lived top squarks with R-parity violating decays to a b quark and a lepton, masses below 550–1130 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence for equal branching fractions between lepton flavors, depending on the squark decay length. This mass bound is the most stringent to date for top squark proper decay lengths greater than 3 mm."
"Search for supersymmetry in events with one lepton and multiple jets exploiting the angular correlation between the lepton and the missing transverse momentum in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The AuthorResults are presented from a search for supersymmetry in events with a single electron or muon and hadronic jets. The data correspond to a sample of proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV with an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1, recorded in 2016 by the CMS experiment. A number of exclusive search regions are defined according to the number of jets, the number of b -tagged jets, the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the jets, and the scalar sum of the missing transverse momentum and the transverse momentum of the lepton. Standard model background events are reduced significantly by requiring a large azimuthal angle between the direction of the lepton and of the reconstructed W boson, computed under the hypothesis that all of the missing transverse momentum in the event arises from a neutrino produced in the leptonic decay of the W boson. The numbers of observed events are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes, and the results are used to set lower limits on supersymmetric particle masses in the context of two simplified models of gluino pair production. In the first model, where each gluino decays to a top quark–antiquark pair and a neutralino, gluino masses up to 1.8 TeV are excluded at the 95% CL. The second model considers a three-body decay to a light quark–antiquark pair and a chargino, which subsequently decays to a W boson and a neutralino. In this model, gluinos are excluded up to 1.9 TeV."
"Search for gauge-mediated supersymmetry in events with at least one photon and missing transverse momentum in pp collisions at √s=13TeV  2018 The AuthorA search for gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) in final states with photons and large missing transverse momentum is presented. The data sample of pp collisions at s=13TeV was collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Data are compared with models in which the lightest neutralino has bino- or wino-like components, resulting in decays to photons and gravitinos, where the gravitinos escape detection. The event selection is optimized for both electroweak (EWK) and strong production SUSY scenarios. The observed data are consistent with standard model predictions, and limits are set in the context of a general gauge mediation model in which gaugino masses up to 980 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Gaugino masses below 780 and 950 GeV are excluded in two simplified models with EWK production of mass-degenerate charginos and neutralinos. Stringent limits are set on simplified models based on gluino and squark pair production, excluding gluino (squark) masses up to 2100 (1750) GeV depending on the assumptions made for the decay modes and intermediate particle masses. This analysis sets the highest mass limits to date in the studied EWK models, and in the considered strong production models when the mass difference between the gauginos and the squarks or gluinos is small."
"Measurement of quarkonium production cross sections in pp collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The Author(s)Differential production cross sections of prompt J/ψ and ψ(2S) charmonium and ϒ(nS) (n=1,2,3) bottomonium states are measured in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV, with data collected by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb−1 for the J/ψ and 2.7 fb−1 for the other mesons. The five quarkonium states are reconstructed in the dimuon decay channel, for dimuon rapidity |y|<1.2. The double-differential cross sections for each state are measured as a function of y and transverse momentum, and compared to theoretical expectations. In addition, ratios are presented of cross sections for prompt ψ(2S) to J/ψ ϒ(2S) to ϒ(1S), and ϒ(3S) to ϒ(1S) production."
"Development of highly reinforced maleated natural rubber nanocomposites based on sol–gel-derived nano alumina  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.In the present study, sol–gel synthesized alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Then, Al2O3 nanoparticles were employed to improve cure, mechanical, and thermal properties of maleated natural rubber (MNR) nanocomposites. The MNR nanocomposite with 2 phr nano Al2O3 exhibited excellent value of cure rate index and exceptionally high value of mechanical properties like modulus and tensile strength in comparison to unfilled MNR compound. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that nano Al2O3 was able to improve the thermal stability of MNR composites to some extent. Additionally, the present study revealed that the interfacial interaction between MNR and nano Al2O3 was far better than that between NR and nano Al2O3 as confirmed from crosslinking degree measurement and morphological analysis. The present article offers a fresh approach to prepare high performance nano Al2O3-based MNR compounds for future industrial application.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

"Effect of Silica and Alumina Ratio on Bed Agglomeration during Fluidized Bed Gasification of Rice Straw  2018 IEEE.Bed agglomeration is one operational challenge during fluidized bed gasification when rice straw is used as raw materials. Rice straw contains high potassium and other components which may lower ash melting point causing bed agglomeration. This study focused on the effect of alumina and silica ratio of bed materials in fluidized bed gasifier. The ratio of alumina bed was 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0. The experiments were performed at 700, 800 and 900°C with equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.2. Rice straw size 425-850 μm was used as raw materials. The result showed that the high ratio of alumina deceased bed agglomeration at 700°C. However, similar alumina ratio increased bed agglomeration at 800 and 900°C. In addition, the effect of temperature on defluidization time was significant. As the operating temperature increased, the defluidization time decreased. Although the ratio of the bed material was different but the result of defluidization time show a similar trend. As a result, high operating temperature may not suitable for fluidized bed gasification with this particular biomass. The SEM/EDS analyzed showed that potassium, calcium and silicate are major element in a linkage between bed particles. As a result, 75% of alumina bed ratio at 700°C was sufficient to avoid bed agglomeration during fluidized bed gasification of rice straw. In conclusion, specific ratio of alumina and silica can prevent agglomeration in fluidized bed gasification of rice straw when operating temperature lower than apparent eutectic melting point of involved alkalis from rice straw. The result from this investigation may lead to options on mitigating the problem of bed agglomeration in fluidized bed gasifier of rice straw."

"The study of the local community products (OTOP) website characteristics toward buyer decision using eye tracking  2017 Infonomics Society.Thai government has launched a policy to encourage local community people to sell their products (OTOP) through e-commerce. One Tambon One Product or OTOP was derived from the concept of One Village One Product (OVOP) in Japan. Currently, people sell their products through the e-commerce web portal such as Facebook rather than having their own OTOP official websites. Therefore, this study aims to study and develop the prototype of the official website. The results show that social influence, perceived ease of use, reliability of website and reliability of product have a positive relationship to the intention to buy a product. Researchers further investigated using eye tracking device to analyze the participants' purchasing behavior. The results show that participants spent time looking at images on the center of the homepage, the product menu bar at the bottom of the center of the homepage, and the components from the product page, respectively. Moreover, participants did not spend time looking or even clicking the social network icon such as Facebook. The results of this study and implications are further discussed."
"Identification of heavy-flavour jets with the CMS detector in pp collisions at 13 TeV  2018 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.Many measurements and searches for physics beyond the standard model at the LHC rely on the efficient identification of heavy-flavour jets, i.e. jets originating from bottom or charm quarks. In this paper, the discriminating variables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during the first years of operation of the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, are presented. Heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. For jets with transverse momenta in the range expected in simulated events, these new developments result in an efficiency of 68% for the correct identification of a b jet for a probability of 1% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is about 15%, compared to previous CMS algorithms. In addition, for the first time algorithms have been developed to identify jets containing two b hadrons in Lorentz-boosted event topologies, as well as to tag c jets. The large data sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has also allowed the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification probability of heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms. The b jet identification efficiency is measured with a precision of a few per cent at moderate jet transverse momenta (between 30 and 300 GeV) and about 5% at the highest jet transverse momenta (between 500 and 1000 GeV)."

"Extranuclear signaling by sex steroid receptors and clinical implications in breast cancer  2017 Elsevier B.V.Estrogen and progesterone play essential roles in the development and progression of breast cancer. Over 70% of breast cancers express estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), emphasizing the need for better understanding of ER and PR signaling. ER and PR are traditionally viewed as transcription factors that directly bind DNA to regulate gene networks. In addition to nuclear signaling, ER and PR mediate hormone-induced, rapid extranuclear signaling at the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm which triggers downstream signaling to regulate rapid or extended cellular responses. Specialized membrane and cytoplasmic proteins may also initiate hormone-induced extranuclear signaling. Rapid extranuclear signaling converges with its nuclear counterpart to amplify ER/PR transcription and specify gene regulatory networks. This review summarizes current understanding and updates on ER and PR extranuclear signaling. Further investigation of ER/PR extranuclear signaling may lead to development of novel targeted therapeutics for breast cancer management."
"A simple and low-cost portable paper-based ABO blood typing device for point-of-care testing  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis.ABO blood group is the most important blood type system for transfusion medicine. A paper-based analytical device (PAD) for ABO blood typing has been proposed. The device was composed of Whatman No. 113 paper, an absorbent gel pad, and a 3D-printing cassette. The 3D-printing cassette contained two circular holes for display of letters “A” and “B” on the PAD. Whole blood was dropped onto hydrophilic letters A and B on the PAD, in which the anti-A and anti-B were pre-immobilized, respectively. An absorbent gel pad was used to adsorb excess blood sample and washing solution during the washing step. The particle size of agglutinated red blood cells (RBCs) could not be eluted out of the paper by the elution solution. In contrast, non-agglutinated RBCs were washed out by means of elution solution. The devices could be used for real blood samples in a wide range of hematocrit levels, 21–59%. Unknown blood group samples (n = 500) were identified by the developed device and the results were compared with the conventional method, revealing 100% accuracy. Because of its compact size with low-cost fabrication, the portable ABO blood typing device has great potential for point-of-care testing, particularly in developing countries."
"Gasification of Furniture Waste Sawdust in a Cyclone Gasifier  2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Sawdust is one of the major biomass that was produced over 1 million ton per year in Thailand. A large amount of sawdust can be used as renewable energy. Gasification is one of the high-efficiency processes to convert biomass to the gaseous product. Sawdust is suitable to be converted to the gaseous product due to its high proportion of volatile (73%). In this work, sawdust thermal conversion was investigated by using a stairmand type cyclone gasifier with 100 mm diameter. The operation of the cyclone with short residence time and high efficiency of particulate separation from the gaseous product is suitable for a small particle like sawdust. The influences of equivalence ratio (0.15-0.60) and reactor temperature (700°C , 800°C and 900°C ) on the waste conversion performance were determined. The gas composition (CO, CO2, CH4, H2, and CnHm), carbon and hydrogen conversions, lower heating value and cold gasification efficiency were reported. The data analysis indicated the optimum equivalence ratio is 0.45. Excessively lower or higher equivalence ratio negatively affected the gas composition and heating value of gaseous product. The optimum of reactor temperature is 900°C . The lower temperature also adversely affected the gaseous product, conversion of carbon and hydrogen. The lower heating value of product gas is range from 0.95-3.45 MJ/m3 and the cold gasification efficiency is range from 28-68%. The optimal condition of sawdust gasification in cyclone gasifier is equivalence ratio of 0.45 and temperature of 900°C at which total carbon and hydrogen conversionsare 90% and 60%, respectively."
"Promoting healthy foods in healthcare system in Thailand  2018 Institute of Health Promotion and Education.Background: Inadequate access to healthy foods is among the most important factors contributing to obesity and chronic illnesses due to over-crowdedness of junk foods and bakery shops. Objective: To address an innovative operational model to mitigate the healthy foods inequity in Thailand. Methods: In 2013, the network of health/allied-health professionals from Chulalongkorn University, domestic sciences experts, food professionals and chronic diseases patients from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) were formed. Healthy foods availability, channel of accessibility and consumer behavior were three main strategies deployed. Ready-to-eat healthy foods (RTEHF) were created to match with simple criteria considering calories per portion, fiber, sugar, fat and salt in accordance with recommended daily intake. Four-squared meter area at outpatient building of the KCMH was provided for operation. The kiosk operated in the morning from Mondays to Fridays during September 2014–May 2015. Consumer survey was done to assess satisfaction and adoption. Results: Sixty-two RTEHF menus were created and >50,000 portions were delivered. Monthly surveys were done with high satisfaction rate. Disease-specific healthy menu book was published and disseminated to the public with >10,000 copies downloaded since December 2016. Large public hospitals expressed their interest to adopt this model. Small/medium foods enterprises voluntarily co-created more healthy foods menus to scale up to all public hospitals. Mass media regarded this as a new way for hospital social responsibility. The KCMH administrators offered permanent healthy-foods-area to serve more patients with integrated on-site health education in 2017. Conclusion: Healthy eating in health care system can be successfully achieved by multi-disciplinary and inter-professional collaboration."

Methods: Two cohorts of participants who had previously received HB vaccine at birth followed by either DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP∼T or DTaP-IPV-HB/PRP∼T co-administered with PCV7 at 2, 4, 6 months of age in a randomized, Phase III, observer-blind study in Thailand, were followed up for anti-HBs antibodies (geometric mean concentrations [GMCs] and seroprotection [SP] rate [% of participants with a titer ≥10 mIU/mL]) at 12–18 months of age and 9–10 years of age. A monovalent HB challenge re-vaccination was administered at 9–10 years of age and the anamnestic response was evaluated. Results: Anti-HBs GMCs and SP rates in the DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP∼T and DTaP-IPV-HB/PRP∼T groups were high and similar post-primary vaccination series (2477 mIU/mL and 99.5% and 2442 mIU/mL and 99.5%, respectively) and declined to a similar extent in each group at 12–18 months (154.5 mIU/mL and 90.8% and 162.3 mIU/mL and 96.5%, respectively). Antibody levels further declined at 9–10 years of age (13.3 mIU/mL and 49.3% and 8.0 mIU/mL and 42.9%) and a strong anamnestic response occurred in each group post-HB challenge re-vaccination (92.8% and 98.7%, respectively). Conclusion: The kinetics of long-term anti-HBs antibody persistence were similar following a primary series of DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP∼T or DTaP-IPV-HB/PRP∼T. The response to a subsequent HB challenge re-vaccination was strong and similar in each group, demonstrating persisting immune memory."
"Continued versus interrupted aspirin use and bleeding risk after endoscopic submucosal dissection of gastric neoplasms: A meta-analysis  2018 Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology.Background Balancing the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events for patients who use aspirin and need to undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric neoplasms is a delicate process. The current guidelines from different associations provide inconsistent recommendations. Methods MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched through August 2017 for studies that compared the risk of post-ESD bleeding in patients who continued aspirin vs. those who discontinued aspirin preoperatively. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results A total of five studies that included 700 patients were identified. Our meta-analysis could not demonstrate a significantly increased risk of post-ESD bleeding among the aspirin-continued group compared to the aspirin-interrupted group, the pooled OR being 1.81 (95%CI 0.85-3.83). The statistical heterogeneity was insignificant, with an I2 of 25%. Nine thrombotic events occurred in the aspirin-interrupted group whereas none occurred in the aspirin-continued group. Conclusions This meta-analysis could not demonstrate that continuation of aspirin significantly increases the risk of post-ESD bleeding. However, the analysis was restricted by the small sample size and the observational nature of the primary studies. Randomized controlled trials are still needed to clarify this risk."
"Meta-analysis of GWAS on both Chinese and European populations identifies GPR173 as a novel X chromosome susceptibility gene for SLE  2018 The Author(s). Background: Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with female predominance, particularly affecting those of childbearing age. We performed analysis of three genome-wide genotyping datasets of populations of both Chinese and European origin. Methods: This study involved 5695 cases and 10,357 controls in the discovery stage. The lead signal on chromosome X was followed by replication in three additional Asian cohorts, with 2300 cases and 4244 controls in total. Conditional analysis of the known associated loci on chromosome X was also performed to further explore independent signals. Results: Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs13440883 in GPR173 was found to be significantly associated with SLE (P meta = 7.53 × 10 -9 , OR meta = 1.16), whereas conditional analysis provided evidence of a potential independent signal in the L1CAM-IRAK1-MECP2 region in Asian populations (rs5987175 [LCA10]). Conclusions: We identified a novel SLE susceptibility locus on the X chromosome. This finding emphasizes the importance of the X chromosome in disease pathogenesis and highlights the role of sex chromosomes in the female bias of SLE."
"Isolation of Chromium(VI) from Aqueous Solution by Electromembrane Extraction  2017 Taylor & Francis.Electromembrane extraction (EME) is a powerful extraction and preconcentration technique for ionizable species. However, the ionic contents in the sample can influence the extraction efficiency and system stability due to electrolysis. In this work, the electromembrane extraction of chromium(VI) was developed using various levels of ionic samples. 2-Nitrophenyl octyl ether was the most suitable supported liquid membrane that delayed the electrolytic occurrence of air bubbles at the electrodes due to its high viscosity and high dielectric constant properties. The electromembrane extraction method was optimized using 5 mM NaCl (630 µS cm−1); the applied potential was 100 V and the extraction time was 15 min. The enrichment factor of 80 was obtained over a linear working range of 10.0–80.0 µg L−1. The method performance was tested using mineral water, drinking water, tap water, and surface water. The method recoveries based on matrix-matched calibration were 95–125% with standard deviations within 15%."
"High dose oral Vitamin C and mesenchymal stem cells aid wound healing in a diabetic mouse model  Philosophy Documentation Center. All rights reserved. Objective: This study sought to determine the effects of oral vitamin C (VitC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in diabetic nude mice. Method: Bilateral, full-skin thickness wounds were created as an in vivo wound model in BALB/C diabetic nude mice. The mice were separated into five groups: control (CON); diabetes mellitus (DM, from a streptozotocin injection); DM treated with MSCs (DM+MSCs); DM treated with VitC (DM+VitC), and DM treated with MSCs and VitC (DM+MSCs+VitC). After wounding, daily oral-feeding of high dose VitC (1.5g/l) was administered, and a single dose of MSCs (1x10 6 cells) was given topically using matrix gel application to the wounded area. Results: At day seven, the lowest rate of wound healing, in terms of percentage of wound closure, appeared in the DM group, as compared with the CON and all other treatment groups (mean percentage of wound closure and standard deviation), CON=75.94±7.09%; DM=55.65±9.59%; DM+MSCs=78.57±6.46%; DM+VitC=77.52±3.31%; and DM+MSCs+VitC=84.61±2.87%, p≤0.05. At day 14 post-wounding, the combination of oral high dose VitC and MSCs accelerated wound healing (91.44±3.19%, p≤0.05). In addition, the highest capillary density in DM+MSCs+VitC was obtained at 14 days post-wounding (29.49±7.30%, p≤0.05). Conclusion: The findings of this study highlight the possibility of using oral high dose VitC in adjunct to MSCs to increase angiogenesis and accelerate diabetic wound healing in an animal model. This novel therapeutic approach should be studied further to test if it could be a useful adjunct of existing therapies to prevent infection and amputation in patients with diabetes."
"Acute Retroviral Syndrome Is Associated with High Viral Burden, CD4 Depletion, and Immune Activation in Systemic and Tissue Compartments .Background Many individuals with acute human immunodeficiency virus infection (AHI) experience acute retroviral syndrome (ARS), which is associated with adverse long-term clinical outcomes. Methods Participants presenting for voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing were enrolled during AHI in Bangkok, Thailand. ARS was defined by ≥3 qualifying signs/symptoms. HIV burden, immunophenotypes, and biomarkers were stratified by ARS diagnosis at enrollment and after up to 96 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results From 212382 samples screened, 430 participants were enrolled during AHI, including 335 (78%) with ARS. Median age was 26 years and 416 (97%) were men. Sixty (14%) underwent sigmoid biopsy and 105 (24%) underwent lumbar puncture during AHI. Common symptoms included fever (93%), fatigue (79%), pharyngitis (67%), and headache (64%). Compared to those without ARS, participants with ARS were in later Fiebig stages with higher HIV RNA in blood, colon, and cerebrospinal fluid; higher total HIV DNA in blood; CD4 depletion in blood and colon; and elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein, and D-dimer (all P <.05). Subgroup analyses of Fiebig I/II participants (95 with ARS, 69 without) demonstrated similar findings. After 96 weeks of ART, TNF-α and interleukin 6 were elevated in the ARS group (P <.05) but other biomarkers equilibrated. Conclusions ARS was associated with high viral burden, CD4 depletion, and immune activation across multiple body compartments during AHI and prior to ART. Persistent inflammation despite suppressive ART could contribute to increased morbidity in individuals who experience ARS."
"Differences in Neuritogenic Activity and Signaling Activation of Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, and Their Aglycones in Neuro-2a cells .Madecassoside (MS) and asiaticoside (AS) along with their aglycones, madecassic acid (MA) and asiatic acid (AA), are considered the major neuroactive triterpenoid constituents of Centella asiatica. In this study, we aimed to compare MS, AS, MA, and AA for their neurite outgrowth activities and mechanisms in Neuro-2a cells. Immunofluorescent cell staining showed MS and AS significantly increased the percentage of neurite-bearing cells (%NBC) and the neurite length with higher potency than MA and AA. The triterpenoid glycosides induced sustained extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, while their aglycones activated only transient signaling of ERK1/2. Suppression of ERK1/2 activation significantly abolished not only cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation but also the increment of %NBC and neurite length in MS- and AS-treated cells. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation did not produce similar blockage of CREB activation and neurite outgrowth in MA- and AA-treated cells. On the other hand, inactivation of protein kinase B (Akt) resulted in a suppression of neurite lengthening in all studied triterpenoids. This is the first study discerning the different signaling pathways of neurite outgrowth activity induced by C. asiatica triterpenoid glycosides and aglycones. Neurite outgrowth activity of the glycosides MS and AS was found to involve the activation of sustained ERK phosphorylation leading to CREB activation, while ERK activation was not associated with MA- and AA-induced neurite outgrowth. In addition, Akt activation was evident to be more involved in neurite elongation process."
"Structure of the heart wall and existence of the blood cells in the heart of the dog-faced water snake cerberus rynchops (Schneider, 1799)  2018, Chiang Mai University - Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. All rights reserved.A plurality of investigations on the heart structure of reptiles has been extensively reported; however, it has yet to conduct studies in Cerberus rynchops, the so-called common estuarine water-snake. In this current study, we histologically started to examine the heart wall of the atrium, ventricle chambers, and study the existence of the blood cells in the heart of sexually mature females. The selected samples were those C. rynchops from the Paknam Pranburi Estuary in Thailand using accurate histochemical techniques. The results showed that the heart structure of C. rynchops consisted of three primary compartments (sinus venosus, atrium, and ventricle). All compartments were surrounded by the heart wall, which was typically classified into three layers (the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium), as likely seen in underlying patterns of reptilian heart. In particular, the myocardium of the ventricle in this snake was the thickest layer of the heart wall. Major com-ponents of the cardiac muscle fibers in the myocardium with green/ pinkness colors were associated with Massonʼs trichrome and Periodic Shift reagent methods, indicating to present various fibers and glycoproteins. Consequently, several blood cells were also detected in different areas. The normal and atretic red blood cells were seen in the cardiac fluid, as referred to the fluid inside the heart sac, whereas the mast cell was also observed in the heart wall especially myocardium."
"Histopathology of kidney and liver in the captive broodstock (Rastrelliger brachysoma) during its juvenile stage  2018, Chiang Mai University - Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. All rights reserved.This is the first study which explained the histopathology in kidney and liver of the captive broodstock (Rastrelliger brachy-soma) during its juvenile stage, to assess the health status. All fishes (n = 24) with a mean of 5.02±0.87 (SD) cm in total length, were collected during October to December 2013 and processed using standard histological protocols. Conforming to histological observation, kidney and liver parenchyma in this species were clearly altered. The most melanomacrophage center had found to be highly organized in these tissues, whereas a large number of the vacuolar structure in the hepatocyte was shown as an empty space, as also called the hepatocellular lipidosis. All lesions in the abnormal kidney and liver may be related to their reduced functions as well as health status of R. brachysoma under captive conditions."

"The outcomes of cochlear implantation in Thailand: Audiologic performance and quality of life  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Cochlear implantation is the one of modalities for restoring hearing function. Recently, trends in cochlear implants are increase but few studies have reported on quality of life and hearing outcomes after cochlear implant placement in Thailand. Objective: To assess the auditory performance and quality of life of patients after receiving cochlear implants. Materials and Methods: An observational study was conducted in 11 cochlear implant centers in Thailand. The study was implemented through a secure web-based platform. Retrieved data concerning cochlear implants were classified into two periods. Prior to October 1, 2016, retrospective chart reviews were performed, whereas the prospective element of the study investigated patients who underwent cochlear implantation after October 1, 2016. Data were collected until August 31, 2017. Results: Two hundred and twenty-six patients were registered. Unfortunately, 10 medical chart records contained insufficient data; thus, data from 216 patients were analyzed. Postoperative hearing outcomes, specifically aided thresholds, PB scores and SRT/ STD scores were superior to pre-implant performance and improved at each successive post-implant assessment point (p = 0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively). It took a median of 36 months to aurally rehabilitate patients: the criterion used was achieving a CAP score of more than 5, indicating good communication performance. Use of sign language alone as a means of preoperative communication was a predictor of poor rehabilitation success (p = 0.013). The QOL of patients with cochlear implants was assessed with questionnaires including EQ5D5L, Pedsql, and HUI3. The outcomes were not clearly significantly better than pre-implantation; however, in the early post-operative period the trend was superior to pre-implantation performance. Complications of cochlear implantation were rare in our series. Conclusion: Cochlear implantation in Thailand seems to be providing good audiologic parameters, communication performances and QOL. A limitation of the study is the small amount of data due to difficulty in retrieving retrospective data. Therefore, a standard system for managing case data should be instituted now to improve the evidence base concerning outcomes of cochlear implant surgery."
"Health effects of using mobile communication devices: A case study in senior citizens, Thailand  2018, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.The trend of using mobile devices amongst the elderly population is continuously increasing. Therefore, the aims of this study were to study the usage status of communication devices and applications amongst the elderly population and to determine factors associated with health effects related to mobile communication device usage among the elderly people in Thailand. A descriptive cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in four main regions of Thailand. Four hundred and forty-eight elderly people who regularly use smartphone or tablet computers participated in the study. Face-to-face interviews were carried out and data was recorded in a prepared questionnaire. Participants whose age averaged 65.11 ±5.26 years old participated in this study. The average time spent on using devices was 2.70 hours/day. The positive health effects of using smartphone or tablet devices were reported to be as follows: an increased sense of self-value and confidence (90.6%) and an increased feeling of intimacy towards others (82.6%). The negative health effects were dim eyes (52.7%), shoulder or neck pain or muscle soreness (52.5%), an increase in social networking activity with strangers (39.5%), and changes in interaction with those around them (32.6%). Moreover, the results showed that the time spent on mobile phones, the type of application used, the time of usage, and rest breaks between using devices were significantly associated with negative health effects (p<0.05). The findings show that Thai elderly people have been confronted by several health effects regarding mobile communication device and application usage. Consequently, practical intervention to reduce those negative health effects should be considered by providing knowledge about using mobile communication devices in proper ways."
"RNA sequencing of kidney distal tubule cells reveals multiple mediators of chronic aldosterone action  2018 the American Physiological Society.The renal aldosterone-sensitive distal tubule (ASDT) is crucial for sodium reabsorption and blood pressure regulation. The ASDT consists of the late distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule (CNT), and collecting duct. Due to difficulties in isolating epithelial cells from the ASDT in large quantities, few transcriptome studies have been performed on this segment. Moreover, no studies exist on isolated DCT2 and CNT cells (excluding intercalated cells), and the role of aldosterone for regulating the transcriptome of these specific cell types is largely unknown. A mouse model expressing eGFP in DCT2/CNT/ initial cortical collecting duct (iCCD) principal cells was exploited to facilitate the isolation of these cells in high number and purity. Combined with deep RNA sequencing technology, a comprehensive catalog of chronic aldosterone-regulated transcripts from enriched DCT2/CNT/ iCCD principal cells was generated. There were 257 significantly down-regulated and 290 upregulated transcripts in response to aldosterone (P < 0.05). The RNA sequencing confirmed aldosterone regulation of well-described aldosterone targets including Sgk1 and Tsc22d3. Changes in selected transcripts such as S100a1 and Cldn4 were confirmed by RT-qPCR. The RNA sequencing showed downregulation of Nr3c2 encoding the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and cell line experiments showed a parallel decrease in MR protein. Furthermore, a large number of transcripts encoding transcription factors were downregu-lated. An extensive mRNA transcriptome reconstruction of an enriched CNT/iCCD principal cell population was also generated. The results provided a comprehensive database of aldosterone-regulated transcripts in the ASDT, allowing development of novel hypotheses for the action of aldosterone."
"Autism phenotype in fragile X premutation males is not associated with FMR1 expression: A preliminary evaluation  2018 Hiroshima University Medical Press.To explore the association between autism phenotype and FMR1 protein (FMRP), FMR1 mRNA and CGG repeat length in 31 male FMR1 premutation carriers aged 3.0 to 27.9 years old (mean 13.0 ± SD 6.5) using the ADOS communication, social interactive and total scores. FMRP levels were determined using the sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method, FMR1 mRNA expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR, and CGG repeat size was determined using Southern blot and PCR analyses. There was no significant difference in FMRP, CGG repeat length, and FMR1 mRNA between fifteen subjects without (ASD / PDDNOS / autism and sixteen subjects with ASD / PDDNOS / autism. ADOS scores were not significantly associated with either FMRP or FMR1 mRNA, This preliminary evaluation found that autism phenotype is not associated with the level of expression of either FMR1 mRNA or FMRP. However, CGG was significantly negative associated with both ADOS communication score (p= 0.0173) and ADOS total score (p= 0.0358)."
"Pertussis in thai adult and pediatric patients presenting with prolonged acute cough  2018, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved.Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. In Thailand, a national passive surveillance system showed a rise in the incidence of pertussis during 2015-2016, especially among infants less than one year of age. In order to investigate the rate of pertussis in children and adult presenting with cough of more than seven days and to evaluate associated factors, a cross-sectional study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok and at Phrasaeng Hospital, Surat Thani, Thailand between September 2016-2017. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from out-patient and hospitalized children and adults who presented with cough of more than seven days. Each specimen was tested for presence of Berdetella pertussis by quantitative real-time PCR and further confirmed by conventional PCR and nucleotide sequencing. Of 70 patients presenting with prolonged acute cough enrolled in this study, seven cases were diagnosed with pertussis by confirmed sequencing, comprising four infants younger than one year of age and three adults 27, 38 and 56 years of age. Patients with pertussis have significantly more reported whooping (p = 0.001), cyanosis (p = 0.002), tachypnea (p = 0.001), and chest retractions (p = 0.009) compared to the enrolled patients. Our results highlight the presence of pertussis in 10% of patients with prolonged acute cough. Physicians should acknowledge the possibility of pertussis in infants presenting with the abovementioned signs and symptoms."
"Phylogenetic relationships of kaempferia plants based on inter-simple sequence repeat fingerprints  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.Plants in genus Kaempferia (Zingiberaceae) have been used as folk medicine in several countries. Identification and classification of Kaempferia plants are difficult because of the morphological similarity between species. In this study, phylogenetic relationships of Kaempferia species were employed by inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) fingerprints. Ten ISSR primers of 45 ISSR primers produced 186 bands with an average 19 bands per primer. The similarity index (SI) ranged from 0.0023-0.9950. A dendrogram was constructed using unweighted pair-group method of the arithmetic average (UPGMA). The results showed that the Kaempferia species could be divided into two main groups. The phylogenetic relationships were associated with the morphological characteristics."
"Line loss reduction by optimal location of battery energy storage system for the daily operation in microgrid with distributed generations  2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.Distributed generations (DGs) such as solar and wind generations are used as generation source in the microgrid. Due to the fluctuation of renewable energy sources, the battery energy storage system (BESS) is one of the essential components to control and improve the quality of power microgrid. However, a placement for BESS installation with minimizing line loss is one of the most concern problems. This paper aims to determine the optimal location of the BESS by using the analytical method with the line loss sensitivity index. A multi-period optimal power flow (OPF) and line loss analysis with BESS parameters were investigated considering the daily operation of a microgrid in connected mode. The simulation performed on the microgrid that wants to keep total power generation from DGs in BESS and low energy consumption from the utility. Microgrid includes 3 DGs (biomass, solar and wind turbine generators) to assess the robustness of BESS placement. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the presented method. The optimal location of BESS can reduce line power loss and power consumption from the utility."

"Double-layered TiO2/activated carbon films with enhanced photocatalytic activity towards methylene blue degradation  2018, National Institute of Optoelectronics. All rights reserved.Double-layered films of TiO2 and activated carbon were fabricated on aluminum substrates by electrophoretic deposition. Moreover, TiO2 powder was synthesized by solvothermal process. The photocatalytic efficiency and reusability of the resulting films were tested for the photodegradation of methylene blue under ultraviolet irradiation. The double-layered films obtained using the synthesized TiO2 exhibited the highest photodegradation efficiency (94%) for removing methylene blue. The immobilized film could solve the problem of separation and recovery of powder cata lyst in practical applications. Therefore, the imobilized systems are an advantage for wastewater treatment because they are cost-effective, eco-friendly and reusable with relatively high photocatalytic performance."
"Urgent pelvic exenteration: Should the indication be extended?   The ASCRS 2018.BACKGROUND: Pelvic exenteration carries significant risks of morbidity and mortality. Preoperative management is therefore crucial, and the exenteration procedure is usually performed in an elective setting. In cases of rectal cancer, however, tumor-related complications may cause a patient's condition to deteriorate rapidly, despite optimal management. Urgent pelvic exenteration then may be an option for these patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the outcomes of pelvic exenteration between the urgent and elective settings. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. SETTING: This study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between February 2006 and June 2012. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were included. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent pelvic exenteration for locally advanced rectal cancer. They were assigned to urgent and elective setting groups according to their preoperative conditions. The urgent setting group included patients who required urgent pelvic exenteration because of intestinal obstruction, bowel perforation, bleeding, or uncontrolled sepsis, despite optimal management preoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twenty-six patients were classified in the urgent setting group, and 27 were classified in the elective setting group. Three-year overall and disease-free survivals were compared between the 2 groups. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity and mortality were also studied. RESULTS: Three-year overall survival was 62.2% and 54.4% in the elective and urgent groups (p = 0.7), whereas three-year disease-free survival was 43% and 63.8% (p = 0.33). The median follow-up time was 33 months. Thirty-day morbidity did not differ between the 2 groups (p = 0.49). A low serum albumin level was a significant risk factor for complications. There was no postoperative mortality in this study. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study performed at 1 institution, and it lacked quality-of-life scores. CONCLUSION: Pelvic exenteration in an urgent setting is feasible and could offer acceptable outcomes. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A591."
"Asiaticoside induces osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells through the Wnt pathway  2018 American Academy of PeriodontologyBackground: Asiaticoside is a compound isolated from Herb Centella asiatica, which has been shown to promote osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells. This study investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the asiaticoside-induced osteogenic differentiation of hPDL cells. Methods: hPDL cells were incubated with various concentrations of asiaticoside to test cell viability by MTT assay. The mRNA expression levels were analyzed by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Osteogenic differentiation was determined by alkaline phosphatase activity assay and alizarin red staining. The subcellular localization of β-catenin was analyzed by both immunofluorescence and western blot. Results: The results showed that asiaticoside had no effect on the cell viability at any of the tested concentrations. Real-time PCR revealed that osterix (OSX) and dentin matrix protein1 (DMP1) mRNA were significantly enhanced by asiaticoside treatment. Alkaline phosphatase activity and in vitro mineralization were also significantly induced. Interestingly, asiaticoside dose-dependently increased WNT3A mRNA expression, but not WNT5A and WNT10B. The activation of Wnt signaling was shown to result in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin as evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. Pre-treatment with recombinant human Dickkopf1 (rhDKK1) inhibited asiaticoside-induced β-catenin nuclear translocation and osteoblast marker gene expression. Moreover, rhDKK1 attenuated asiaticoside-induced DMP1 protein expression. Conclusion: The data demonstrate that asiaticoside induces osteogenic differentiation of hPDL cells by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The findings suggest that asiaticoside could be used as a novel therapeutic drug for periodontal tissue regeneration."

"Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of mangosteen peels as natural antimicrobial/anticancer materials against pathogenic microbes and B16F10 murine melanoma  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.The antimicrobial, anticancer and cytotoxic activities of crude extracts of the pericarps of mangosteen fruits, generated using water or ethanol as the extractant, were evaluated and compared with those of α-mangostin. Due to higher total mangostin content in the ethanolic extract (EEM), this extract exhibited considerably stronger activities against pathogenic microbes and skin cancer cells than the aqueous extract (AEM) did. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli showed high sensitivity to EEM, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 31.25 and 125 μg/ml, respectively. Selected bacteria and fungi exhibited good in vitro susceptibility to EEM, with minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations (MBC and MFC) of less than 0.5 mg/ml. Shrinkage and lysis of bacteria were clearly observed after treatment with EEM or α-mangostin. EEM and α-mangostin also caused swelling and lysis of Candida albicans. EEM showed a great cytotoxic effect on B16F10 murine melanoma cells at 24, 48, and 72 h judged by IC50values of less than 25 μg/ml, which were 15-100 times lower than IC50values of AEM, but 4-10 times higher than those of α-mangostin.

All rights reserved.Objective: To explore and detect problems about misunderstanding/misinterpretation of the International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] Thai version and attempt to find a solution by developing a modified version. Materials and Methods: Two exploratory surveys were conducted in populations supposed to have LUTS. In the first survey, after explanation, 49 participants were tested with the original IPSS Thai version and a new preliminary version A. They rated the level of ease-difficulty in understanding of both versions. In the second survey, with 135 respondents, three versions were tested; the original, the preliminary version A and B, without explanation given. There were observers detecting respondents’ problems in completing the questionnaires. The problems were evaluated using Student’s t-test, ANOVA, univariate, and multivariate analyses. Results: In the first survey, the preliminary version A was significantly easier to understand from the ease-difficulty score, while the second survey showed no difference among all three versions. Four problems were detected, which were rating number confusion, proportional number misunderstanding, the second question misunderstanding, and preliminary versions doubt. With higher ages, more problems existed, but with higher education, fewer misunderstandings appeared. Lower educated respondents, junior high school, and primary school level or below were about 3 and 16 times more likely to experience problems, respectively. The problems were almost 6-fold more likely to occur in respondents older than 70 years. With low education and old age occurring together, problems were much more likely to appear (OR 91.00, 95% CI 10.59 to 781.63). Conclusion: There were some misunderstandings and misinterpretation problems in the IPSS Thai version, which were more likely to occur in low educated and/or elderly responders. The validity and reliability of the modified version of Thai IPSS will be further studied."

"Liver fluke-associated biliary tract cancer  2018 Editorial Office of Gut and Liver. All rights reserved.Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive cancer arising from epithelial cells of the bile duct. Most patients with CCA have an unresectable tumor at the time of diagnosis. In Western countries, the risk of CCA increases in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, whereas liver fluke infection appears to be the major risk factor for CCA in Asian countries. A diagnosis of liver fluke infection often relies on stool samples, including microscopic examination, polymerase chain reaction-based assays, and fluke antigen detection. Tests of serum, saliva and urine samples are also potentially diagnostic. The presence of liver fluke along with exogenous carcinogens magnifies the risk of CCA in people living in endemic areas. The ""liver fluke-cholangiocarcinoma"" carcinogenesis pathways consist of mechanical damage to the bile duct epithelium, immunopathologic and cellular reactions to the liver fluke's antigens and excretory/secretory products, liver fluke-induced changes in the biliary tract microbiome and the effects of repeated treatment for liver fluke. A vaccine and novel biomarkers are needed for the primary and secondary prevention of CCA in endemic areas. Importantly, climate change exerts an effect on vector-borne parasitic diseases, and awareness of liver fluke should be enhanced in potentially migrated habitat areas."
"Search for new physics in final states with an energetic jet or a hadronically decaying W or Z boson and transverse momentum imbalance at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN.A search for new physics using events containing an imbalance in transverse momentum and one or more energetic jets arising from initial-state radiation or the hadronic decay of W or Z bosons is presented. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1, is used. The observed data are found to be in agreement with the expectation from standard model processes. The results are interpreted as limits on the dark matter production cross section in simplified models with vector, axial-vector, scalar, and pseudoscalar mediators. Interpretations in the context of fermion portal and nonthermal dark matter models are also provided. In addition, the results are interpreted in terms of invisible decays of the Higgs boson and set stringent limits on the fundamental Planck scale in the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali model with large extra spatial dimensions."
"Practising on the Moon: Globalization and Legal Consciousness of Foreign Corporate Lawyers in Myanmar  Cambridge University Press and KoGuan Law School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2018.This paper argues that there are two contrasting versions of legal consciousness among foreign corporate lawyers in Myanmar. The old hands - expatriates who have practised there prior to the opening-up of the country in 2011 - depict an image of a fairly developed legal system and an appreciation of local law and practices. In contrast, the newcomers who came to Myanmar after 2011 tell accounts of the void of law. Contrary to the old hands who see themselves as mere translators of Myanmar's local law and practices, the newcomers assume a more active role of importers and educators of modern business law and norms to fill the void. The paper uses two theoretical models in legal consciousness studies - the community of meaning model and the power and resistance model - to explain the difference between the two groups, as well as the implication the newcomers' legal consciousness has for the globalization of law."
"Optimal plasma pretreatment EBV DNA cut-off point for nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy  The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Objective: Plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA concentration at the time of diagnosis (pre-EBV) can be used to stratify risk for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients. However, pre-EBV cut-off values vary among studies. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of 208 NPC patients from a phase II/III study comparing sequential (SEQ) vs. simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) intensity modulated radiation therapy. The objective was to identify the optimal pre-EBV cut-off value to predict overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and distant metastatic free survival (DMFS) rates. Results: The pre-EBV and post-treatment EBV DNA (post-EBV) were detectable in 59.1% and 3.8% of the patients, respectively. A new pre-EBV cut-off value of 2300 copies/ml was identified by the receiver operating characteristics analysis. This cut-off value showed 82% sensitivity, 59% specificity and 31.7% positive and 93.5% negative predictive values in predicting OS. The 3-year OS, PFS and DMFS were 95.6 vs. 73.8%, 89.8 vs. 55.3% and 93 vs. 70.1% for pre-EBV < vs. ≥ 2300 copies/ml, respectively. Older age group (≥ 45 years), high pre-EBV and detectable post-EBV concentration were independent predictors for OS, PFS and DMFS in a multivariate analysis. When the stage grouping and pre-EBV value were combined, a subgroup of patients with stage II-III and pre-EBV values < 2300 copies/ml. had the best survival outcomes, while the worst survival subgroup was the patients with stage III-IVb with pre-EBV values ≥ 2300 copies/ml. Conclusions: Pre-EBV cut-off of 2300 copies/ml is an optimal value predicting OS, PFS and DMFS."
"Search for a heavy right-handed W boson and a heavy neutrino in events with two same-flavor leptons and two jets at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for a heavy right-handed W boson (WR) decaying to a heavy right-handed neutrino and a charged lepton in events with two same-flavor leptons (e or μ) and two jets, is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data, collected by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. No significant excess above the standard model expectation is seen in the invariant mass distribution of the dilepton plus dijet system. Assuming that couplings are identical to those of the standard model, and that only one heavy neutrino flavor NR contributes significantly to the WR decay width, the region in the two-dimensional (mWRmNR) mass plane excluded at 95% confidence level extends to approximately mWR=4.4 TeV and covers a large range of right-handed neutrino masses below the WR boson mass. This analysis provides the most stringent limits on the WR mass to date.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Quality of life among older adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in the tertiary referral hospital of Bangkok, Thailand  2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.Background: The incidence of cancer among the age group of 55 years and above was very high compared to other age groups and tends to rise with age. The quality of life is necessary for deploying on the predictions and forecasts in the lives of patients with cancer. This study aims to explore the quality of life (QOL) and its factors associated among older adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in the tertiary referral hospital of Bangkok, Thailand. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient chemotherapy centre of King Chulalongkorn Memorial hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 105 older adult cancer patients aged 55 years old and over diagnosed with colon cancer, lung cancer, and/or breast cancer and received the chemotherapy treatment were interviewed after obtaining the informed consent. A validated, reliable Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General (FACT-G) Thai version tool was used to measure the quality of life. The chi square test was performed to find association of the variable with QOL scores. Results: The mean score of the quality of life (total QOL) in the elderly participants was found 44.41±7.95 which was at the moderate level. There was no relationship between the QOL and variables such as age, gender, marital status, educational levels, occupation and chronic diseases. Furthermore, no correlation was found between QOL and the types of cancer and the pain levels among older adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Conclusion: The intervention and program to improve QOL should encourage to be organized in all hospitals including clinics, public or private hospitals and furthermore promoted among their patients along with the chemotherapy and regular treatment."
"Construct validity of Thai lifelong learning inventory: Evidence from high-school students in Phrae, Kalasin, Prachin Buri, and Pangnga provinces  2018 Kasetsart UniversityThis study aimed to assess the construct validity of Thai lifelong learning inventory: evidence from high-school students in Phrae, Kalasin, Prachinburi, and Pang-nga provinces. The participants in this study were 1,939 high-school students and were selected through multi-stage sampling. The tools were two sets of an inventory to determine the students of lifelong learning, each of which contained 70 items. The first set was a 5-scale Likert inventory and the second was a situational inventory with 4 choices for each item. The data were validated using second order confirmatory factor analysis followed by the LISREL 8.72. The results indicated that the models fitted to the empirical data found in the former inventory, χ2 = 125.79, df = 106, p =.09, GFI = 1.00, AGFI = 0.98 and RMSEA = 0.01, and those found in the latter,χ2 = 149.96, df = 127, p =.08, GFI = 0.99, AGFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.01."
"Comparative study of the orr activity and stability of pt and ptm (M = ni, co, cr, pd) supported on polyaniline/carbon nanotubes in a pem fuel cell  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability of platinum (Pt) and PtM (M = Ni, Co, Cr, Pd) supported on polyaniline/carbon nanotube (PtM/PANI-CNT) were explored and compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst (ETEK). The Pt/PANI-CNT catalyst exhibited higher ORR activity and stability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst even though it had larger crystallite/particle sizes, lower catalyst dispersion and lower electrochemical surface area (ESA), probably because of its high electrical conductivity. The addition of second metal (M) enhanced the ORR activity and stability of the Pt/PANI-CNT catalyst, because the added M induced the formation of a PtM alloy and shifted the d-band center to downfield, leading to a weak chemical interaction between oxygenated species and the catalyst surface and, therefore, affected positively the catalytic activity. Among all the tested M, the addition of Cr was optimal. Although it improved the ORR activity of the Pt/PANI-CNT catalyst slightly less than that of Pd (around 4.98%) in low temperature (60◦C)/pressure (1 atm abs), it reduced the ESA loss by around 14.8% after 1000 cycles of repetitive cyclic voltammetry (CV). In addition, it is cheaper than Pd metal. Thus, Cr was recommended as the second metal to alloy with Pt on the PANI-CNT support."
"Search for decays of stopped exotic long-lived particles produced in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search is presented for the decays of heavy exotic long-lived particles (LLPs) that are produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the CERN LHC and come to rest in the CMS detector. Their decays would be visible during periods of time well separated from proton-proton collisions. Two decay scenarios of stopped LLPs are explored: a hadronic decay detected in the calorimeter and a decay into muons detected in the muon system. The calorimeter (muon) search covers a period of sensitivity totaling 721 (744) hours in 38.6 (39.0) fb−1 of data collected by the CMS detector in 2015 and 2016. The results are interpreted in several scenarios that predict LLPs. Production cross section limits are set as a function of the mean proper lifetime and the mass of the LLPs, for lifetimes between 100 ns and 10 days. These are the most stringent limits to date on the mass of hadronically decaying stopped LLPs, and this is the first search at the LHC for stopped LLPs that decay to muons.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Surgeons' recommendation is the factor in determining the breast cancer surgery procedures: An experience from rural hospital in Thailand  2018 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.Introduction: The majority of breast cancer patients in rural hospital in developing countries still warrant for total mastectomy. Surgeon advice regard surgical procedure is one of the most important factors in decision making. Our study aims to compare the rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy (MT) and mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (MTIBR) between the surgeons who offer only MT (group A) and who offer BCS MT and MTIBR (group B). Method: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Ratchaburi hospital, Thailand from January 2010 to April 2014. We categorized patients into 2 groups (group A and B). Univariated analysis was selected to determine the factors that associated with the breast surgery procedures. Results: From January 2010 to April 2014, we recruited 310 breast cancer patients, 221 patients (71.2%) were treated by surgeons in group A, 89 patients (28.7%) by surgeons in group B. The choice of breast surgery is significantly different between 2 groups (P < 0.001). In group A, 213 (96.3%) patient had MT and only 3 (1.3%) BCS and 5 (2.2%) MTIBR. Whilst in group B, 58 (65.1%) patient had MT and 11 (12.3%) BCS and 20(22.4%) MTIBR. Choice of breast surgery in patients with stage 1,2,3 are significantly different between 2 groups (P=0.004, < 0.001, 0.025 respectively). Age is the only factor that significantly affects the choice of surgery in the group B but not in group A. Conclusion: Surgeon's competency and comprehensive preoperative consultation by offering BCS, MT and MTIBR can affect the choice of surgical procedure for breast cancer patient."
"Search for natural and split supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV in final states with jets and missing transverse momentum  2018, The Author(s).A search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is performed in final states comprising one or more jets and missing transverse momentum using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data were recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The number of signal events is found to agree with the expected background yields from standard model processes. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified models of SUSY that assume the production of gluino or squark pairs and their prompt decay to quarks and the lightest neutralino. The masses of bottom, top, and mass-degenerate light-flavour squarks are probed up to 1050, 1000, and 1325 GeV, respectively. The gluino mass is probed up to 1900, 1650, and 1650 GeV when the gluino decays via virtual states of the aforementioned squarks. The strongest mass bounds on the neutralinos from gluino and squark decays are 1150 and 575 GeV, respectively. The search also provides sensitivity to simplified models inspired by split SUSY that involve the production and decay of long-lived gluinos. Values of the proper decay length cτ0 from 10−3 to 105 mm are considered, as well as a metastable gluino scenario. Gluino masses up to 1750 and 900 GeV are probed for cτ0 = 1 mm and for the metastable state, respectively. The sensitivity is moderately dependent on model assumptions for cτ0 ≳ 1 m. The search provides coverage of the cτ0 parameter space for models involving long-lived gluinos that is complementary to existing techniques at the LHC."
"Search for a heavy resonance decaying to a pair of vector bosons in the lepton plus merged jet final state at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for a new heavy particle decaying to a pair of vector bosons (WW or WZ) is presented using data from the CMS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016. One of the bosons is required to be a W boson decaying to eν or μν, while the other boson is required to be reconstructed as a single massive jet with substructure compatible with that of a highly-energetic quark pair from a W or Z boson decay. The search is performed in the resonance mass range between 1.0 and 4.4 TeV. The largest deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed for a mass near 1.4 TeV and corresponds to a local significance of 2.5 standard deviations. The result is interpreted as an upper bound on the resonance production cross section. Comparing the excluded cross section values and the expectations from theoretical calculations in the bulk graviton and heavy vector triplet models, spin-2 WW resonances with mass smaller than 1.07 TeV and spin-1 WZ resonances lighter than 3.05 TeV, respectively, are excluded at 95% confidence level.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Factors controlling the release of metals and a metalloid from the tailings of a gold mine in Thailand  2017 The Author(s).This study focused on assessing the release potential of various metals and a metalloid (arsenic; As) leached from gold mine tailings under three different degrees of acidity (pH 2, 4 and 6.5) using a synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP). Tailings were collected from four pits from 0 to 16 m depth, approximately. The samples were divided into the three types, based on their position in the tailings and on other physical characteristics, of the sulphide (c. 5 m depth), mixing (c. 1m depth) and oxide (c. 10 m depth) zones. This study was primarily concerned with the concentrations of As and Mn, which were found to exceed the Thailand Industrial Effluent Standard (TIES) in the tailings from all zones. Principal component analysis revealed that the release of metals and As from the tailings under acidic conditions, as well as the metals and As mobility, was mainly controlled by the pH and redox conditions. Moreover, the first principal component had high positive loadings of Mn, Pb, Co and Ni (R2 > 0.80), indicating that these four metals are either released into the environment from a common source or/and their geochemical behaviour in the aqueous phase is similar."
"High-flow nasal cannula versus conventional oxygen therapy in children with respiratory distress  2018 Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy compared with conventional oxygen therapy in children presented with respiratory distress. Study Design: This was a randomized controlled study. Materials and Methods: Infants and children aged between 1 month to 5 years who were admitted to our tertiary referral center for respiratory distress (July 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015) and met the inclusion criteria were recruited. Interventions: Infants and children hospitalized with respiratory distress were randomized into two groups of interventions. All clinical data, for example, respiratory score, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were recorded. The results were subsequently analyzed. Results: A total of 98 respiratory distress children were enrolled during the study period. Only 4 children (8.2%) failed in HFNC therapy, compared with 10 children (20.4%) in conventional oxygen therapy group (P = 0.09). After adjusted for body weight, underlying diseases, and respiratory distress score, there was an 85% reduction in the odds of treatment failure in HFNC therapy group (adjusted odds ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.66, P = 0.01). Most children in HFNC therapy group had significant improvement in clinical respiratory score, heart rate, and respiratory rate at 240, 360, and 120 min compared with conventional oxygen therapy (P = 0.03, 0.04, and 0.03). Conclusion: HFNC therapy revealed a potential clinical advantage in management children hospitalized with respiratory distress compared with conventional respiratory therapy. The early use of HFNC in children with moderate-to-severe respiratory distress may prevent endotracheal tube intubation."
"Jet properties in PbPb and pp collisions at √sNN=5.02 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Modifications of the properties of jets in PbPb collisions, relative to those in pp collisions, are studied at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of sNN=5.02 TeV via correlations of charged particles with the jet axis in relative pseudorapidity (Δη), relative azimuth (Δϕ), and relative angular distance from the jet axis Δr=(Δη)2+(Δϕ)2. This analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 404 μb−1 and 27.4 pb−1 for PbPb and pp collisions, respectively. Charged particle number densities, jet fragmentation functions, and jet shapes are presented as a function of PbPb collision centrality and charged-particle track transverse momentum, providing a differential description of jet modifications due to interactions with the quark-gluon plasma."
"Structure and mechanical properties of ADC 12 Al foam-polymer interpenetrating phase composites with epoxy resin or silicone  Carl Hanser Verlag, München Materials Testing.Metal foam is a high-porosity engineering material which has many outstanding properties such as lightness, high specific strength and stiffness, large energy absorption during impact and good thermal transportation. Impregnation of metal foams with polymers produces new types of composites such as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) and co-continuous composites, due to an interconnection on the macroscopic level of individual phases as a co-continuous 3-D network. The coexistence of the metal and polymer phases allows each to contribute its prominent properties to the composite. This novel composite material is a potential candidate for applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The present study aims to develop two IPCs from open-cell Al foams of 20 ppi impregnated with silicone or epoxy resin. The compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristics of IPCs are also examined and compared. The results showed that although both IPCs have a similar foam structure with similar density, the disparities in the properties of impregnated polymers lead to distinct mechanical properties. The combination of the Al foam and polymers, both silicone and epoxy resin, yield stiffer IPCs than either of the two individual materials alone. Higher stiffness was found in IPCs with epoxy resin, owing to the brittle nature of the resin. Energy absorption capacity was also increased when compared with the original Al foam."
"Episodic memory and delayed recall are significantly more impaired in younger patients with deficit schizophrenia than in elderly patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment  2018 Kanchanatawan et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Both amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and schizophrenia, in particular deficit schizophrenia, are accompanied by cognitive impairments. The aim of the present study was to examine the cognitive differences between aMCI and (non)deficit schizophrenia. Methods Towards this end we recruited 60 participants with aMCI, 40 with deficit and 40 with nondeficit schizophrenia and 103 normal volunteers. Cognitive measures were assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) using the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Word list memory (WLM), Word list recall (WLRecall) and Word list recognition (WLRecognition). Data were analyzed using multivariate analyses and machine learning techniques. Results BNT scores were significantly lower in aMCI as compared with nondeficit schizophrenia. Patients with deficit schizophrenia had significantly lower MMSE, WLM, WL True Recall and WL Recognition than aMCI patients, while WL False Recall was significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia than in aMCI. Neural network importance charts show that deficit and nondeficit schizophrenia are best separated from aMCI using total BNT score, while WLM and WL false Recall follow at a distance. Conclusions Patients with schizophrenia and aMCI have a significantly different neurocognitive profile. Memory impairments, especially in episodic memory, are significantly worse in younger patients with deficit schizophrenia as compared with elderly patients with aMCI, while the latter show more dysnomia than patients with schizophrenia."
"Identifying factors affecting the success of rail infrastructure development projects contributing to a logistics platform: A Thailand case study  2018 Kasetsart UniversityThis research identified factors affecting the success of rail infrastructure development projects contributing to Thailand's logistics platform. Projects included in this research were double tracking the existing railways and the construction of new routes. Most projects were in the preparatory stage. The researchers extracted 24 factors from the literature review and categorized them into five dimensions. AHP and fuzzy AHP were deployed and leading success factors were identified. It was found that a rail development master plan has the highest influence on a project's success. The researchers recommend that the Thai government should establish a large-scale, long-term, integrative rail master plan for not only freight transport but also passenger services, since both cannot be solely developed. Along with the initiation of the rail master plan; stimulation should proceed in parallel on: a transit-oriented development scheme; promotion of local market development for a rail parts and assembly industry; implementation of public-private partnerships; and the institution of a new rail regulative agency."
"Giant graviton interactions and M2-branes ending on multiple M5-branes  2018, The Author(s).We study splitting and joining interactions of giant gravitons with angular momenta N1/2 ≪ J ≪ N in the type IIB string theory on AdS5 × S5 by describing them as instantons in the tiny graviton matrix model introduced by Sheikh-Jabbari. At large J the instanton equation can be mapped to the four-dimensional Laplace equation and the Coulomb potential for m point charges in an n-sheeted Riemann space corresponds to the m-to-n interaction process of giant gravitons. These instantons provide the holographic dual of correlators of all semi-heavy operators and the instanton amplitudes exactly agree with the pp-wave limit of Schur polynomial correlators in N = 4 SYM computed by Corley, Jevicki and Ramgoolam. By making a slight change of variables the same instanton equation is mathematically transformed into the Basu-Harvey equation which describes the system of M2-branes ending on M5-branes. As it turns out, the solutions to the sourceless Laplace equation on an n-sheeted Riemann space correspond to n M5-branes connected by M2-branes and we find general solutions representing M2-branes ending on multiple M5-branes. Among other solutions, the n = 3 case describes an M2-branes junction ending on three M5-branes. The effective theory on the moduli space of our solutions might shed light on the low energy effective theory of multiple M5-branes."
"The magnitude of obesity and metabolic syndrome among diabetic chronic kidney disease population: A nationwide study  2018 Kittiskulnam et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Although the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) among dialysis patients has been exceeding than general population, little is known regarding obesity and MetS in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to find the magnitude of obesity and MetS and their associations with impaired renal function among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Methods A national survey of T2DM patients was collected in the Thai National Health Security Office database during 2014–5. The sampling frame was designated as distinct geographic regions throughout the country. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling was used to select the study population. Anthropometry and 12-hour fasting blood samples were obtained by trained personnel. BMI of 25 kg/m2 was classified as obesity. MetS was defined as having elevated waist circumference (>90 and >80 cm in men and women, respectively) plus any two of the followings: triglyceride 150 mg/dL, HDL-C <40 in men or <50 mg/dL in women, blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, and fasting blood sugar 100 mg/dL. CKD was defined as an impaired renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 according to the CKD-EPI equation). Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between obesity and MetS with the presence of CKD. Results A total of 32,616 diabetic patients were finally recruited from 997 hospitals. The mean age was 61.5±10.9 years with 67.5% women. Of the participants, 35.4% were CKD patients. The prevalence of obesity was 46.5% in CKD and 54.1% in non-CKD patients with T2DM (p<0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of MetS in CKD patients was higher than their non-CKD counterparts (71.3 vs 68.8%, p<0.001). Moreover, there was an association between the prevalence of MetS with CKD stage from 3a to 5 (70.1, 72.3, 73.4, and 72.7%, respectively, p trend = 0.02). MetS, but not obesity, had a significant association with CKD in T2DM patients after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities [OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.06–1.22, p<0.001]. When stratified by each component of MetS, only high serum triglyceride and low HDL-C levels were increased in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5 compared with CKD stage 3 (p<0.001) and had a significant relationship with impaired renal function. Conclusion There were relatively high prevalences of both obesity and MetS in T2DM patients. A higher prevalence of MetS, but lower prevalence of obesity, was observed among diabetic CKD group compared with their non-CKD counterparts. MetS, as a surrogate of insulin resistance, appeared to be more important than obesity in the development of impaired renal function in diabetic population."
"Effect of Ions on Removal of TiO2 Nanoparticles by Coagulation and Microfiltration  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Removal of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) from water by coagulation and microfiltration (MF) was investigated at various ionic species and strengths. Appropriate coagulant doses were determined based on the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, and coagulation with ferric chloride (FeCl3) at 0.1-0.2 mM or poly-aluminum chloride (PACl; [Al2(OH)nCl6-n]m) at 0.2-0.4 mM improved removal of TiO2 NPs to more than 90%, and, simultaneously, turbidity was significantly reduced. Using 0.2 mM FeCl3 as a coagulant, the mean particle size of suspended TiO2 NPs decreased from 145 to 43 nm after coagulation and sedimentation as a result of effective floc formation. Microfiltration (nominal pore size: 0.45 μm and 0.10 μm) of uncoagulated TiO2 NP suspensions produced lower NP concentrations in the filtrate than that in the filtrate of pre-coagulated water. This is because pre-coagulation and settling removed large NPs in the feed water that reduce the number of smaller particles than the pore sizes by clogging or blocking membrane pores. Results suggest that removal of NPs by coagulation/sedimentation followed by membrane filtration may be less efficient than direct membrane filtration. Addition of salts (NaCl 0.3-15 mM or CaCl2 0.1-5 mM) to TiO2 NP suspensions before coagulation led to significant reduction (0.28-0.47 mg/L) of TiO2 concentrations in supernatant after sedimentation. Phosphate addition (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mM) increased TiO2 NP concentration after FeCl3 or PACl coagulation and settling, but TiO2 NP removal rate by MF was improved by phosphate addition except for filtering TiO2 NP suspension with 1.0 mM phosphate by a 0.45 μm membrane."

In conclusion, K galanga ethanolic extract has a potential to be used as an anti-fungal oil in water cream formulation."
"Molecular mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis and potential anti-metastatic compounds  2018 International Institute of Anticancer Research. All rights reserved.Throughout the world, breast cancer is among the major causes of cancer-related death and is the most common cancer found in women. The development of cancer molecular knowledge has surpassed the novel concept of cancer biology and unraveled principle targets for anticancer drug developments and treatment strategies. Metastatic breast cancer cells acquire their aggressive features through several mechanisms, including augmentation of survival, proliferation, tumorigenicity, and motility-related cellular pathways. Clearly, natural product-derived compounds have since long been recognized as an important source for anticancer drugs, several of which have been shown to have promising anti-metastasis activities by suppressing key molecular features supporting such cell aggressiveness. This review provides the essential details of breast cancer, the molecular-based insights into metastasis, as well as the effects and mechanisms of potential compounds for breast cancer therapeutic approaches. As the abilities of cancer cells to invade and metastasize are addressed as the hallmarks of cancer, compounds possessing anti-metastatic effects, together with their defined molecular drug action could benefit the development of new drugs as well as treatment strategies."
"Fayet–Iliopoulos terms in supergravity and D-term inflation  2018, The Author(s).We analyse the consequences of a new gauge invariant Fayet–Iliopoulos (FI) term proposed recently to a class of inflation models driven by supersymmetry breaking with the inflaton being the superpartner of the goldstino. We first show that charged matter fields can be consistently added with the new term, as well as the standard FI term in supergravity in a Kähler frame where the U(1) is not an R-symmetry. We then show that the slow-roll conditions can be easily satisfied with inflation driven by a D-term depending on the two FI parameters. Inflation starts at initial conditions around the maximum of the potential where the U(1) symmetry is restored and stops when the inflaton rolls down to the minimum describing the present phase of our Universe. The resulting tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial perturbations can be even at observable values in the presence of higher order terms in the Kähler potential."
"How operators’ legal status affects safety of intercity buses in Thailand  National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.Legalization is often a policy solution to perceived problems of inefficient and unsafe operation of informal buses in developing countries. Facing the world’s second worst road safety record, the Thai government is set to ban the use of vans for intercity bus services and is considering banning individual operators and requiring them to form a legal entity. A question thus arises whether an operator’s legal status significantly affects bus safety. This paper aims to answer that question by analyzing routelevel data on accidents and legal status of intercity bus operators. The results of Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses confirm that the use of vans increases accident and fatality risks of intercity bus services. But the evidence does not support the government’s claim that requiring operators to register as legal entities would make intercity services safer. For long-distance routes, more bus companies mean greater accident risks. The only situation where more individual operators mean higher safety risks is with fatality rates on long-distance routes. However, fatality rates are actually lower with more individual operators on short-distance routes. This is likely because most individual operators on short-distance routes belong to informal operator groups that adopt internal rules and procedures to govern members’ behaviors. The key policy implications are that mandatory legal registration of operators does not automatically enhance bus safety, and that safety measures should focus on operational characteristics and actual practice."
"Amycolatopsis silviterrae sp. Nov., isolated from forest soil  2018 IUMS.A novel actinobacterial strain, designated C12CA1T, was isolated from forest soil in the conservation area of Chulabhorn dam, Thailand, and its taxonomic position was determined by using a polyphasic approach. Strain C12CA1T contained meso-2,6 diaminopimelic acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan, and arabinose and galactose as diagnostic sugars of the whole-cell hydrolysate. On the basis of morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain C12CA1T was classified in the genus Amycolatopsis. It contained MK-9(H4) as the predominant menaquinone, C16:0, iso-C15:0 and iso-C16:0 as the major cellular fatty acids, and several phospholipids consisting of diphosphotidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, hydroxyphosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol mannosides and an unidentified glucosamine-containing phospholipid. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence and phylogenetic analyses, strain C12CA1T was closely related to Amycolatopsis vancoresmycina DSM 44592T (98.96%) and Amycolatopsis pretoriensis JCM 12673T (98.82%). The strain exhibited low DNA-DNA relatedness values with A. vancoresmycina DSM 44592T (6.9±0.2-11.6±1.9%) and A. pretoriensis JCM 12673T (8.8±0.3-9.2±1.8%). The DNA G+C content of strain C12CA1T was 69.8 mol%. Based on the results of polyphasic characterization, strain C12CA1T represents a novel species of the genus Amycolatopsis, for which the name Amycolatopsis silviterrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is C12CA1T (=TBRC 1456T=NBRC 111116T)."
"Tuned Amperometric Detection of Reduced β-Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide by Allosteric Modulation of the Reductase Component of the p -Hydroxyphenylacetate Hydroxylase Immobilized within a Redox Polymer  2018 American Chemical Society.We report the fabrication of an amperometric NADH biosensor system that employs an allosterically modulated bacterial reductase in an adapted osmium(III)-complex-modified redox polymer film for analyte quantification. Chains of complexed Os(III) centers along matrix polymer strings make electrical connection between the immobilized redox protein and a graphite electrode disc, transducing enzymatic oxidation of NADH into a biosensor current. Sustainable anodic signaling required (1) a redox polymer with a formal potential that matched the redox switch of the embedded reductase and avoided interfering redox interactions and (2) formation of a cross-linked enzyme/polymer film for stable biocatalyst entrapment. The activity of the chosen reductase is enhanced upon binding of an effector, i.e. p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid (p-HPA), allowing the acceleration of the substrate conversion rate on the sensor surface by in situ addition or preincubation with p-HPA. Acceleration of NADH oxidation amplified the response of the biosensor, with a 1.5-fold increase in the sensitivity of analyte detection, compared to operation without the allosteric modulator. Repetitive quantitative testing of solutions of known NADH concentration verified the performance in terms of reliability and analyte recovery. We herewith established the use of allosteric enzyme modulation and redox polymer-based enzyme electrode wiring for substrate biosensing, a concept that may be applicable to other allosteric enzymes."
"Polymorphism in merozoite surface protein-7E of Plasmodium vivax in Thailand: Natural selection related to protein secondary structure  2018 Cheng et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP-7) is a multigene family expressed during malaria blood-stage infection. MSP-7 forms complex with MSP-1 prior to merozoite egress from erythrocytes, and could affect merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. To characterize sequence variation in the orthologue in P. vivax (PvMSP-7), a gene member encoding PvMSP-7E was analyzed among 92 Thai isolates collected from 3 major endemic areas of Thailand (Northwest: Tak, Northeast: Ubon Ratchathani, and South: Yala and Narathiwat provinces). In total, 52 distinct haplotypes were found to circulate in these areas. Although population structure based on this locus was observed between each endemic area, no genetic differentiation occurred between populations collected from different periods in the same endemic area, suggesting spatial but not temporal genetic variation. Sequence microhetero-geneity in both N- and C- terminal regions was predicted to display 4 and 6 α-helical domains, respectively. Signals of purifying selection were observed in α-helices II-X, suggesting structural or functional constraint in these domains. By contrast, α-helix-I spanning the putative signal peptide was under positive selection, in which amino acid substitutions could alter predicted CD4+ T helper cell epitopes. The central region of PvMSP-7E comprised the 5’-trimorphic and the 3’-dimorphic subregions. Positive selection was identified in the 3’ dimorphic subregion of the central domain. A consensus of intrinsically unstructured or disordered protein was predicted to encompass the entire central domain that contained a number of putative B cell epitopes and putative protein binding regions. Evidences of intragenic recombination were more common in the central region than the remainders of the gene. These results suggest that the extent of sequence variation, recombination events and selective pressures in the PvMSP-7E locus seem to be differentially affected by protein secondary structure."
"Arthroscopic Medial Meniscus Root Repair With Soft Suture Anchor Without Posterior Portal Technique  2018 Arthroscopy Association of North AmericaMedial meniscal root injury is known to cause an increase in tibiofemoral contact pressure and results in early osteoarthritis. There have been many reports on meniscal root repairing techniques, which can be categorized into 2 groups. One is transosseous suture, and the other is anchor suture repair. Both techniques show improvement in not only clinical performance, but also radiographic finding. However, the meniscal root repair procedure must be performed by experienced physicians. Most techniques require a posteromedial portal, which takes time and may even complicate the procedure. The technique proposed in this study provides a simple procedure in which no posteromedial portal is required and a soft anchor suture, a commonly used suture in glenolabral repair, is used. The use of this suture, instead of the conventional anchor suture, is believed to lessen possible injury to the cartilage and results in easier revision surgery."
"Estimation of the radiation dose for pediatric CBCT indications: a prospective study on ProMax3D  2018 BSPD, IAPD and John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: An increasing number of CBCT units and a wide variability of radiation doses have been reported in dentistry lately. Aim: To estimate the effective, cumulative, and organ absorbed doses in children exposed to CBCT over 2 years. Design: A prospective study was conducted in children who underwent CBCT diagnostic imaging with the ProMax3D machine. Organ and effective doses were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation using 5- and 8-year-old pediatric voxel phantoms. Extrapolation procedures were applied to estimate doses for other ages and CBCT protocols used in clinical conditions. Results: The median effective dose was 137.9 μSv, and the median cumulative dose was 231.4 μSv. Statistically significant differences in the effective doses and cumulative doses were found for various indications of CBCT in children (P < 0.001). The median absorbed organ dose for brain and thyroid was significantly higher for the clinical condition that required large FOVs (2.5 mGy and 1.05 mGy, respectively) compared to medium (0.19 and 0.51 mGy) and small FOVs (0.07 and 0.24 mGy; P < 0.05). The radiation dose of salivary glands did not vary significantly with FOV. Conclusion: The results revealed the variation of CBCT doses and the influence of FOV size in pediatric exposure."
"Williams–Beuren syndrome in diverse populations  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a common microdeletion syndrome characterized by a 1.5Mb deletion in 7q11.23. The phenotype of WBS has been well described in populations of European descent with not as much attention given to other ethnicities. In this study, individuals with WBS from diverse populations were assessed clinically and by facial analysis technology. Clinical data and images from 137 individuals with WBS were found in 19 countries with an average age of 11 years and female gender of 45%. The most common clinical phenotype elements were periorbital fullness and intellectual disability which were present in greater than 90% of our cohort. Additionally, 75% or greater of all individuals with WBS had malar flattening, long philtrum, wide mouth, and small jaw. Using facial analysis technology, we compared 286 Asian, African, Caucasian, and Latin American individuals with WBS with 286 gender and age matched controls and found that the accuracy to discriminate between WBS and controls was 0.90 when the entire cohort was evaluated concurrently. The test accuracy of the facial recognition technology increased significantly when the cohort was analyzed by specific ethnic population (P-value < 0.001 for all comparisons), with accuracies for Caucasian, African, Asian, and Latin American groups of 0.92, 0.96, 0.92, and 0.93, respectively. In summary, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with WBS and demonstrate how facial analysis technology can support clinicians in making accurate WBS diagnoses."
"Effects of Facebook usage on English learning behavior of Thai English teachers  2018 Kasetsart UniversityThis research investigated the use of Facebook to enhance the effectiveness of English writing and learning among English language teachers. English language learning through Facebook design was evaluated using the results from data collected from 403 completed copies of a questionnaire. The questionnaire sought responses on the problems, needs, readiness, and suggestions of the respondents—Thai teachers of English in 437 Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) schools. Seventeen BMA teachers who exhibited a keen interest in using Facebook over other social media were selected as test subjects. One facilitator was included. All participants used the English language to interact on Facebook every day for six weeks. A mixed method consisting of qualitative and quantitative approaches was employed to analyze the collected data. The frequency, percentage, and content analysis were used to analyze the qualitative data consisting of the survey questionnaires, observations on interaction through Facebook sites, in-depth interviews, participants’ reflections, and self-notes. A t-test was used to analyze quantitative pre- and post-test data. The findings of this study indicated that Facebook could significantly help improve writing skills, namely accuracy, meaningfulness, clarity, and relevance. It also effectively enhanced teachers’ English learning attributes, namely fluency, confidence, satisfaction, value, and self-efficacy belief."
"Prevention of vaccine-matched and mismatched influenza in children aged 6–35 months: a multinational randomised trial across five influenza seasons  2018 Elsevier LtdBackground: Despite the importance of vaccinating children younger than 5 years, few studies evaluating vaccine prevention of influenza have been reported in this age group. We evaluated efficacy of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) in children aged 6–35 months. Methods: In this phase 3, observer-blinded, multinational trial, healthy children from 13 countries in Europe, Central America, and Asia were recruited in five independent cohorts, each in a different influenza season. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either IIV4 (15 μg haemagglutinin antigen per strain per 0·5 mL dose; a single dose on day 0 for vaccine-primed children, and two doses, on days 0 and 28, for vaccine-unprimed children) or to one or two doses of a non-influenza control vaccine. Primary endpoints were moderate-to-severe influenza or all influenza (irrespective of disease severity) confirmed by RT-PCR on nasal swabs. Cultured isolates were further characterised as antigenically matched or mismatched to vaccine strains. Efficacy was assessed in the per-protocol cohort and total vaccinated cohort (time-to-event analysis), and safety was assessed in the total vaccinated cohort. Findings: Between Oct 1, 2011, and Dec 31, 2014, 12 018 children were recruited into the total vaccinated cohort (6006 children in the IIV4 group and 6012 children in the control group). 356 (6%) children in the IIV4 group and 693 (12%) children in the control group had at least one case of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza. Of these 1049 influenza strains, 138 (13%) were A/H1N1, 529 (50%) were A/H3N2, 69 (7%) were B/Victoria, and 316 (30%) were B/Yamagata. Overall, 539 (64%) of 848 antigenically characterised isolates were vaccine-mismatched (16 [15%] of 105 for A/H1N1; 368 [97%] of 378 for A/H3N2; 54 [86%] of 63 for B/Victoria; 101 [33%] of 302 for B/Yamagata). Vaccine efficacy was 63% (97·5% CI 52–72) against moderate-to-severe influenza and 50% (42–57) against all influenza in the per-protocol cohort, and 64% (53–73) against moderate-to-severe influenza and 50% (42–57) against all influenza in the total vaccinated cohort. There were no clinically meaningful safety differences between IIV4 and control. Interpretation: IIV4 prevented influenza A and B in children aged 6–35 months despite high levels of vaccine mismatch. Vaccine efficacy was highest against moderate-to-severe disease, which is the most clinically important endpoint associated with greatest burden. Funding: GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA."
"Characteristics of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using the Thai Version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Tests: A Multivariate and Machine Learning Study  2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.Background: The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) developed a neuropsychological battery (CERAD-NP) to screen patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has received attention as a pre-dementia stage. Objectives: To delineate the CERAD-NP features of MCI and their clinical utility to externally validate MCI diagnosis. Methods: The study included 60 patients with MCI, diagnosed using the Clinical Dementia Rating, and 63 normal controls. Data were analysed employing receiver operating characteristic analysis, Linear Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Neural Network models, and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). Results: MCI patients were best discriminated from normal controls using a combination of Wordlist Recall, Wordlist Memory, and Verbal Fluency Test. Machine learning showed that the CERAD features learned from MCI patients and controls were not strongly predictive of the diagnosis (maximal cross-validation 77.2%), whilst t-SNE showed that there is a considerable overlap between MCI and controls. Conclusions: The most important features of the CERAD-NP differentiating MCI from normal controls indicate impairments in episodic and semantic memory and recall. While these features significantly discriminate MCI patients from normal controls, the tests are not predictive of MCI."
"Mediation analysis of systemic inflammation on the association between periodontitis and glycaemic status  2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: This cross-sectional study investigated the associations between periodontitis, systemic inflammation and glycaemic status. Materials and Methods: The participants were divided into three groups: normoglycaemia, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the associations between periodontitis severity and glycaemic status, adjusting for potential confounders. Mediation analysis of four systemic inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR), was performed. Results: This study comprised 2,036 participants, aged 39-66 years. Severe periodontitis was associated with IFG and diabetes with odds ratios of 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-2.4, p =.023) and 2.4 (95% CI: 1.3-4.5, p =.006), respectively. The CRP, WBC and PLR were associated with both periodontitis severity and glycaemic status (p <.05). In contrast, the NLR was associated with periodontitis severity (p <.05) but not glycaemic status (p >.05). The CRP, WBC and PLR mediated 8%, 13% and 6%, respectively, of the association between severe periodontitis and diabetes. Similar proportions mediated were observed for the periodontitis-IFG association. Conclusions: Our findings support the role of systemic inflammation as mediators of the associations between periodontitis and IFG or diabetes."
"Pituitary height at magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric isolated growth hormone deficiency  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for neuroradiologic evaluation of patients with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency (IGHD). Objectives: To compare pituitary height and morphology at MRI between patients with IGHD and controls. Materials and methods: This retrospective study was conducted in pediatric patients, 3 years–15 years old, who had had brain MRI with non-contrast-enhanced midsagittal T1-weighted images. These images were measured for pituitary height and morphology of the pituitary gland including shape, stalk and posterior pituitary bright spot was evaluated. Results: One hundred and nineteen patients were included, with 49 and 70 patients assigned to the study and control groups, respectively. Mean pituitary height was significantly less in the IGHD group than in the control group (3.81 mm±1.38 vs. 4.92 mm±1.13, retrospectively; P<0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference in the pituitary height between groups in the prepubertal (8–10 years) and pubertal (11–13 years) periods (P=0.039 and P=0.006, respectively) and a trend toward significance in the postpubertal period (P=0.053). There was a significant difference in pituitary shape between IGHD and controls when combining grades III, IV and V (P=0.007). Other abnormal MRI findings of the pituitary stalk and posterior bright spot were significantly more often observed in the IGHD group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Pituitary height was significantly smaller in patients with IGHD than in controls during prepuberty and puberty. Abnormal concave superior contour, hypoplastic stalk and absent/ectopic posterior bright spot were observed significantly more often among patients with IGHD."
"Surface morphology control of Nb thin films by biased target ion beam deposition  2018 Author(s).One of the many challenges for niobium (Nb) based superconducting devices is the concurrent improvement over the surface morphology without undermining superconducting properties. In this work, the authors demonstrated the modification to the surface morphology of 10-100 nm Nb thin films deposited by bias target ion beam deposition (BTIBD). Target current (IT) and target bias (VT) were the main parameters explored and were found to be critical to the control over crystallinity and surface morphology of Nb films. The optimized growth conditions yielded a ∼50 nm thick Nb film with the root-mean-square roughness of 0.4 nm, which was an order of magnitude smoother than that of Nb films by sputtering process. The critical temperature for superconductivity was close to the value of the bulk Nb (∼9.3 K) with a very homogeneous transition (the superconducting transition width ΔTc of 0.1 K). The quality of Nb film was evident in the presence of a very thin proximity layer (∼0.75 nm). The experimental results demonstrated that the preparation of smooth Nb films with expected superconductivity by BTIBD could serve as a base electrode for the in situ magnetic layer or insulating layer for superconducting electronic devices."
"Factors Associated With Response to Biofeedback Therapy for Dyssynergic Defecation  2018 AGA InstituteBackground & Aims: Biofeedback therapy is effective for dyssynergic defecation (DD), but it is not widely available or reimbursed, and is labor intensive. It is therefore important to select the appropriate patients for this treatment. We investigated symptoms and demographic, manometric, and other factors associated with outcomes of biofeedback therapy in patients with DD. Methods: We performed a post hoc analysis of 2 prospective studies of biofeedback therapy in 127 adult outpatients (18–75 years old, 120 female) with chronic constipation who failed to respond to treatment with dietary fiber or laxatives (>1 year) and were diagnosed with DD based on standard criteria. In each study, patients received 1-hour, biweekly office biofeedback therapy (6 sessions) or home biofeedback therapy with a device. A therapist used visual feedback, postural, and diaphragmatic breathing techniques to teach subjects to improve defecation. Treatment success was defined by a composite of normalization of dyssynergia pattern and increase of 20 mm in baseline bowel satisfaction score. Factors were compared between the treatment success and failure groups. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: Of the 127 patients enrolled, 77 (61%) had treatment success. Dyssynergia was corrected in 78% of patients and bowel satisfaction improved in 64% of patients. Baseline demographic features, constipation symptoms, manometric and sensory parameters, balloon expulsion time, and colonic transit results were similar between treatment failure and success groups. Patients with lower baseline bowel satisfaction score (P =.008) and patients who used digital maneuvers (P =.04) were more likely to have successful biofeedback therapy. Conclusions: Biofeedback therapy is successful in more than 60% of patients with DD. Patients who used digital maneuvers and patients with lower baseline levels of bowel satisfaction were more likely to have treatment success, whereas other factors were not associated with success. Biofeedback therapy should be offered to all patients with DD, irrespective of baseline symptoms or anorectal physiology findings."
"Heterologous expression and antimicrobial activity of OsGASR3 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)  2018 Elsevier GmbHAccording to an in silico analysis, OsGASR3 (LOC_Os03g55290) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) was predicted to be involved in plant defense mechanisms. A semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that OsGASR3 is highly expressed in the inflorescences of Thai jasmine rice (O. sativa L. subsp. indica ‘KDML 105′). To characterize the biological activity of OsGASR3, we produced an OsGASR3–glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami (DE3) cells for a final purified recombinant OsGASR3 yield of 0.65 mg/L. The purified OsGASR3 inhibited the hyphal growth of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense and Helminthosporium oryzae at a relatively low concentration (7.5 μg/mL). Furthermore, OsGASR3 exhibited in planta inhibitory activity against Xanthomonas campestris, suggesting its involvement in defense mechanisms, in addition to its previously reported functions affecting growth and development. These observations indicate that recombinant OsGASR3 may be useful for protecting agriculturally important crops against pathogenic microbes."
"Use of the Renal Angina Index in Determining Acute Kidney Injury  2018 International Society of NephrologyIntroduction: The renal angina index (RAI) is determined based on changes in the creatinine and condition scores of patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the RAI in predicting persistent acute kidney injury (AKI) in Asian intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: This is a subanalysis of 3 prospective studies conducted in Japan and Thailand. The RAI was calculated for all enrolled patients using the method of Goldstein and colleagues, with a minor modification for adults on day 2. To determine the accuracy of RAI further, we evaluated a subgroup of patients for whom baseline serum creatinine values were available at ICU admission (i.e., those with hospital-acquired AKI). AKI biomarkers were evaluated for their efficacy in improving the performance of RAI. The outcome was defined as AKI stage 2 or 3 over 48 hours. Results: Of the 263 patients analyzed, a total of 22 progressed to stage 2 or 3 AKI over 48 hours. The RAI was associated with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.63 in receiver-operating characteristics analysis, with a cutoff of 10. In those admitted from general wards, the RAI had good performance, with an AUC of 0.73 and a cutoff of 6. A combination of L-type fatty acid–binding protein with the RAI improved the predictive performance for assessing persistent AKI with an AUC of 0.79. Conclusion: The RAI may be effective in predicting persistent AKI in adult patients admitted from general wards. Incorporation of AKI biomarkers into the RAI may potentially improve prediction."
"Comprehensive 2D gas chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry with 2D retention indices for analysis of volatile compounds in frankincense (Boswellia papyrifera)  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Frankincense gum resin secreted from Boswellia papyrifera was analysed by comprehensive 2D gas chromatography hyphenated with accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC−accTOFMS). Direct multiple injection experiments with stepwise isothermal temperature programming were then performed to construct isovolatility curves for reference alkane series in GC×GC. This provides access to calculation of second dimensional retention indices (2I). More than 500 peaks were detected and 220 compounds mainly comprising monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and oxygenated forms of these compounds were identified according to their 1I,2I and accurate mass data. The study demonstrates the capability of GC×GC−accTOFMS with retention data on two separate column phases, as an approach for improved component identification. A greater number of identified and/or tentatively identified terpenoids in this traditional Chinese medicine allow for a more comprehensive coverage of the volatile composition of frankincense."
"Spontaneous and controlled-diameter synthesis of single-walled and few-walled carbon nanotubes  2018 Elsevier B.V.In this study, we explored the spontaneous and controlled-diameter growth of carbon nanotubes. We evaluated the effects of catalyst density, reduction time, and a number of catalyst coating on the substrate (for multi-walled carbon nanotubes) on the diameter of single-walled carbon nanotubes and the number of layers in few-walled carbon nanotubes. Increasing the catalyst density and reduction time increased the diameters of the carbon nanotubes, with the average diameter increasing from 1.05 nm to 1.86 nm for single-walled carbon nanotubes. Finally, we succeeded in synthesizing a significant double-walled carbon nanotube population of 24%."
"Adsorptive removal of carbamazepine using biosynthesized hematite nanoparticles  2018 Elsevier B.V.Pharmaceutical pollution is threatening the lives of millions of people across the globe. One of such pollutant, carbamazepine (CBZ) has been found to be toxic to aquatic invertebrates, fish, bacteria, algae and cause severe side effects in humans. Nano-remediation has received considerable attention in recent years due to their good adsorption capacity because of their large surface area. In the present study, the efficacy of eco-friendly biosynthesized hematite nanoparticles to remove CBZ in water sample as a function of time and concentration was studied. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the nanoparticles were about 20–40 nm in diameter. The adsorption efficiency increased with time and attained equilibrium within 2.5 h. The experimental results best fitted to Freundlich model, suggesting the multilayer adsorption of CBZ on hematite nanoparticles. Within 2 h, >90% of CBZ desorbed from hematite nanoparticle surface. It was concluded that hematite nanoparticles produced by biosynthesis can be considered as an effective CBZ adsorbent."
"Analysis of snake venom metalloproteinases from Myanmar Russell's viper transcriptome  2018 Elsevier LtdSnake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are the key enzymes in Russell's viper (RV) venom which target all important components of haemostasis, such as clotting factors, platelets, endothelial cells and basement membrane. The structural diversity of SVMPs contributes to the broad spectrum of biological activities. The aim of the study was to investigate the SVMP transcript profile to gain better insights into the characteristic clinical manifestations of the Myanmar Russell's viper (MRV) bites that distinguish it from the RVs of other habitats. Next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) of mRNA from MRV venom glands (2 males and 1 female) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and then de novo assembled using Trinity software. A total of 59 SVMP contigs were annotated through a Blastn search against the serpent nucleotide database from NCBI. Among them, disintegrins were the most abundant transcripts (75%) followed by the P-III class SVMPs (25%). The P-II SVMPs were scarce (0.002%), while no P-I SVMPs were detectable in the transcriptome. For detailed structural analysis, contigs were conceptually translated and compared with amino acid sequences from other RVs and other vipers using Clustal Omega. The RTS-disintegrin (jerdostatin homolog) was the most abundant among transcripts corresponding to 5 disintegrin isoforms. From 10 isoforms of SVMPs, RVV-X, and Vipera lebetina apoptosis-inducing protease (VLAIP) homolog, hereby termed Daboia siamensis AIP (DSAIP), were found to be highly expressed. Venom protein analysis using SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry revealed that the disintegrin was scarce, while the latter two SVMPs were abundant. These two proteins can contribute to severe clinical manifestations caused by MRV envenomation."
"Exploring the synergistic effect of short jute fiber and nanoclay on the mechanical, dynamic mechanical and thermal properties of natural rubber composites  2018 Elsevier LtdNatural rubber (NR) composites were reinforced by suitable hybrid fillers system containing short jute fiber and stearic acid modified nano clay. The synergistic effect of short jute fiber and stearic acid modified nanoclay in NR composites was systematically evaluated in the light of cure, mechanical, morphological, dynamic mechanical and thermal properties. Synergistic interaction between short jute fiber and modified nanoclay increased the value of cure rate index (CRI) and tensile strength of NR composites successfully. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated a continuous and smooth surface for the NR composites containing hybrid fillers system. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) confirmed excellent improvement in the rubber/filler interaction for NR/nanoclay/jute fiber hybrid composites as compared to NR composites with single filler system. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) study was utilized to explain the transformation of hydrophilic jute fiber surface to more hydrophobic nature in presence of stearic acid modified nanoclay."
"Green synthesis of fluorescent N,O-chelating hydrazone Schiff base for multi-analyte sensing in Cu2+, F− and CN− ions  2018 Elsevier B.V.A colorimetric and fluorometric hydrazone Schiff's base derived from dehydroacetic acid by three-steps and high-yield syntheses under green approach employing ethanol as a solvent has been prepared. Multi-analyte sensing for both metal cation (Cu2+) and anions (F− and CN−), with high sensitivity and competitive selectivity, was encountered. The sensing mechanism of anion detection found to be deprotonation of N–H and O–H moieties in the presence of ions. However, metal cation like copper(II) ions chelation with sensor, leads to diminish intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) with chelation induced quenching of fluorescence (CHQF). Contrary, anionic interaction ensued in heightened ICT as well as photo-induced electron transfer (PET) processes. The Job's plots interpretation rendered stoichiometry of 2:1 with Cu2+/F− and 1:1 with CN−. Moreover, the detection limits of 0.962 ppm (Cu2+), 0.023 ppm (F−) and 0.073 ppm (CN−) were much lower than WHO guidelines. Further, either water or methanol was employed to differentiate F−/CN− ions with sensor in THF, with prominent visible naked eye and fluorometric responses."
"Dimethylsulfoniopropionate biosynthesis in a diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana: Identification of a gene encoding MTHB-methyltransferase  2018 Elsevier Inc.Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is one of the most abundant molecules on earth and plays a pivotal role in the marine sulfur cycle. DMSP is believed to be synthesized from methionine by a four-step reaction pathway in marine algae. The genes responsible for biosynthesis of DMSP remain unidentified. A diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335 is an important component of marine ecosystems and contributes greatly to the world's primary production. In this study, through genome search, in vivo activity and functional studies of cDNA products, a gene encoding Thalassiosira methyltransferase (TpMMT) which catalyzes the key step of DMSP synthesis formation of 4-methylthio-2-hydroxybutyrate (DMSHB) from 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate (MTHB), was identified. The amino acid sequence of TpMMT was homologous to the methyltransferase from Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCAP 1055/1, but not the recently identified bacterium gene. High salinity and nitrogen limitation stresses caused the increase of DMSP content and TpMMT protein in Thalassiosira. In addition to TpMMT, the enzyme activities for the first three steps could be detected and enhanced under high salinity, suggesting the importance of four-step DMSP synthetic pathway in Thalassiosira."
"Effect of sintering additives on barium cerate based solid oxide electrolysis cell for syngas production from carbon dioxide and steam  2017The effect of sintering additives (NiO, Co2O3, and ZnO) on the performance of barium-cerate-based solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) is investigated. The performance of the SOEC with different sintering additives is determined in terms of relative density, electrochemical performance, and catalytic activity toward reverse water gas shift reaction. BaCeO3 (BC) and BaCe0.9Gd0.1O3−δ (BCG) are synthesized using conventional precipitation method, comparing to ultrasonic-assisted precipitation. The sintering additives promote both densification and grain growth. The relative density of the BCG without sintering additive is 69% while that of the BCG with 1 wt% of Co2O3, NiO and ZnO is 95%, 95% and 88%, respectively. The SEM images indicate that the BCG with sintering additives exhibits dense grains with relatively large grain size. Although the BGC with NiO and Co2O3 exhibit maximum relative density, the sample with ZnO shows relatively highest conductivity with the lowest activation energy of conduction and the sample with NiO provides the largest CO yield and CO2 conversion. The activation energy of conduction is found to be 375.41, 70.06, 66.86 and 61.80 kJ mol−1 for BCG, BCG with 1 wt% Co2O3, NiO and ZnO, respectively. The BCG with 1 wt% NiO provides the highest CO2 conversion and CO yield at temperature below 700 °C (62% CO2 conversion and 32% CO yield at 700 °C). Temperature program of oxidation (TPO) reveals that carbon deposition can cause the low CO yield at the operating temperature above 700 °C."
"Highly selective sub–10 ppm H2S gas sensors based on Ag-doped CaCu3Ti4O12 films  2017The detection of the toxic H2S gas is of great practical, environmental and industrial interest. This work presents sensing devices fabricated with Ag-doped CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) thin films using a cost effective sol-gel deposition method. When compared with undoped CCTO sensors, very low doping levels of Ag cause a dramatic improvement of the response towards H2S gas. The Ag-doped CCTO films were found to be remarkable sensors towards H2S in the concentration range of 0.2–10 ppm. In addition, the response of these sensors towards NH3, H2, NO2 and ethanol vapor was up to two orders of magnitude lower than that for H2S, yielding a highly selective mean of detecting and quantifying H2S. Gas sensing experiments were conducted at operating temperatures ranging from 150 to 350 °C with an optimum response found at 250 °C. In the studied temperature range, Ag-doped CCTO film sensors also showed much shorter response times than that of undoped one. It is found that Ag plays a role promoting the adsorption and catalytic oxidation of H2S leading to drastic changes in the electrical resistance via electron injection into CCTO."
"Improvement of product selectivity in bicarbonate reduction into formic acid on a tin-based catalyst by integrating nano-diamond particles  2018 Institution of Chemical EngineersIn this study, the efficiency of electrochemical reduction of bicarbonate into formic acid was improved by using a composite electrode made up of tin (Sn), nanodiamond (ND) and carbon nanotube (CNT). In the absence of ND, a compositional ratio of 10/90 (Sn/CNT) demonstrated the highest current density. However, by adding ND in a compositional ratio of 10/90/100 (Sn/CNT/ND) the highest efficiency towards formate/formic acid was achieved. It was observed that the presence of ND enhanced the selectivity of product for formic acid. The effects of bicarbonate concentration and scan rate have also been studied to understand the reduction mechanism. The peak potential shifted towards larger negative values of applied potential with an increase in the scan rate from 0.01 to 0.1 V/s, confirming the irreversible nature of the reduction process. The linear relationship between the current and the square root of the scan rate (with a slope value of 0.519) suggested that the reaction process is fully diffusion-controlled. Formic acid was produced using both electrodes; however, the electrode containing nano-diamond successfully improved the process yield for formic acid. Electrochemical impedance study revealed a significant difference between Warburg coefficient for oxidation and reduction processes with values of 29.63 × 1012 and 67.4 Ω. S−0.5 for the applied potentials of 0.5 V and −0.4 V, respectively. This difference confirmed a low resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface for the reduction potentials."
"Subtarsal Fibrosis Is Associated With Ocular Surface Epitheliopathy in Graft-Versus-Host Disease  2018 Elsevier Inc.Purpose: To evaluate occurrence of subtarsal fibrosis in patients with graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and to determine its association with ocular surface epitheliopathy. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We enrolled 40 patients with moderate or severe dry eye disease, including 20 patients with chronic ocular GVHD and 20 patients without (as the control group). All patients had a comprehensive ophthalmic assessment including evaluation for subtarsal fibrosis, corneal and conjunctival staining, tear break-up time (TBUT), and Schirmer test. Furthermore, meibomian gland drop-out area and densities of epithelial and stromal immune cells were measured using meibography and in vivo confocal microscopy, respectively. Results: Subtarsal fibrosis was not seen in any eye of the non-GVHD group. However, 16 eyes (40%) of 10 patients (50%) in the GVHD group had subtarsal fibrosis (P <.001) with an average involvement of 28.9% ± 13.7% of the tarsal area. Fibrosis was more frequent in the upper lids (35%) than in the lower lids (5%). Regression analyses showed that corneal fluorescein staining was significantly associated with the extent of fibrosis (P <.001, β = 0.14) and TBUT (P <.001, β = −0.53) but not with other clinical or imaging parameters. Conjunctival lissamine green staining also had a statistically significant association with the extent of fibrosis (P =.04, β = 0.12) but not other clinical or imaging parameters. Eyes with subtarsal fibrosis had a more severe ocular surface epitheliopathy compared with eyes without fibrosis. Conclusions: Subtarsal fibrosis is present in a significant percentage of patients with chronic ocular GVHD, likely contributing to the ocular surface damage in these patients."
"Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis for brain tissue identification  2018 Elsevier B.V.According to the tissue-specific methylation database (doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2014.09.060), methylation at CpG locus cg03096975 in EML2 has been preliminarily proven to be specific to brain tissue. In this study, we enlarged sample size and developed a technique for identifying brain tissue in aged samples. Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis—for EML2 (COBRA-EML2) technique was established and validated in various organ samples obtained from 108 autopsies. In addition, this technique was also tested for its reliability, minimal DNA concentration detected, and use in aged samples and in samples obtained from specific brain compartments and spinal cord. COBRA-EML2 displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing brain tissue from other tissues, showed high reliability, was capable of detecting minimal DNA concentration (0.015 ng/μl), could be used for identifying brain tissue in aged samples. In summary, COBRA-EML2 is a technique to identify brain tissue. This analysis is useful in criminal cases since it can identify the vital organ tissues from small samples acquired from criminal scenes. The results from this analysis can be counted as a medical and forensic marker supporting criminal investigations, and as one of the evidences in court rulings."
"Ten-Year Survival of End-Stage Renal Disease Patients Treated with High-Efficiency Online Hemodiafiltration: A Cohort Study of a Center in South East Asia  2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.Background: Recently, in the first hemodiafiltration (HDF) experience report from South East Asia (SEA), we reported a 3-year prospective study demonstrating the various short-term benefits of high-efficiency online HDF (OL-HDF) over high-flux hemodialysis (HD). Very few long-term survival reports of high-efficiency OL-HDF are available and the data are heterogeneous and incomplete. Objectives: The present historical cohort study was conducted to determine the long-term survival and outcome of high-efficiency OL-HDF-treated patients. Methods: Sixty-six high-efficiency OL-HDF treated patients at a center in SEA were included in the study. The prescription included blood and dialysis fluid flow rates of 400 and 800 mL/min, respectively. The post- or pre-dilution substitution fluid of 100 or 200 mL/min, respectively, was prescribed. Results: Of 66 HDF patients, whose age was 57.4 ± 14.0 years, there were 38 (58%) females. The majority of comorbidity was diabetes (36%). There were 33 (50%) incident HDF cases that were prescribed OL-HDF at the dialysis initiation and 33 (50%) prevalent HDF cases that were switched from HD to OL-HDF. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate were 95.1, 83.4, 77.7, and 61.8% respectively. The mean survival time was 8.99 ± 0.64 years. There were 15 transplantations and 15 deaths during this study periods. The 2 major causes of death were cardiovascular (33.3%) and infectious diseases (20%). Serum ferritin was the only parameter that correlated with mortality (HR 1.004, p = 0.005). There was comparable survival between incident and prevalent HDF cases. The survival after transplantation of a sub-group of patients who received kidney transplantation (KT) was not different from that of the overall HDF patients (p = 0.93). Conclusions: High-efficiency OL-HDF could provide an excellent long-term survival nearly comparable to the KT sub-group."
"Genomewide Association Study of Alcohol Dependence and Related Traits in a Thai Population Copyright  2018 by the Research Society on Alcoholism Background: Alcohol use (both quantity and dependence) is moderately heritable, and genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified risk genes in European, African, and Asian populations. The most reproducibly identified risk genes affect alcohol metabolism. Well-known functional variants at the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase B and other alcohol dehydrogenases affect risk in European and African ancestry populations. Similarly, variants mapped to these same genes and a well-known null variant that maps to the gene that encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) also affect risk in various Asian populations. In this study, we completed the first GWAS for 3 traits related to alcohol use in a Thai population recruited initially for studies of methamphetamine dependence. Methods: All subjects were evaluated with the Thai version of the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA). A total of 1,045 subjects were available for analysis. Three traits were analyzed: flushing, maximum number of alcoholic beverages consumed in any lifetime 24-hour period (“MAXDRINKS”), and DSM-IV alcohol dependence criterion count. We also conducted a pleiotropy analysis with major depression, the only other psychiatric trait where summary statistics from a large-scale Asian-population GWAS are available. Results: All 3 traits showed genomewide significant association with variants near ALDH2, with significance ranging from 2.01 × 10 −14 (for flushing; lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) PTPN11* rs143894582) to p meta = 5.80 × 10 −10 (for alcohol dependence criterion count; lead SNP rs149212747). These lead SNPs flank rs671 and span a region of over a megabase, illustrating the need for prior biological information in identifying the actual effect SNP, rs671. We also identified significant pleiotropy between major depression and flushing. Conclusions: These results are consistent with prior findings in Asian populations and add new information regarding alcohol use-depression pleiotropy."
"A novel PITX2 mutation in non-syndromic orodental anomalies  2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: To identify orodental characteristics and genetic aetiology of a family affected with non-syndromic orodental anomalies. Subjects and Methods: Physical and oral features were characterised. DNA was collected from an affected Thai family. Whole-exome sequencing was employed to identify the pathogenic variants associated with inherited orodental anomalies. The presence of the identified mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: We observed unique orodental manifestations including oligodontia, retained primary teeth, taurodont molars, peg-shaped maxillary central incisors, high attached frenum with nodule and midline diastema in the proband and her mother. Mutation analyses revealed a novel heterozygous frameshift deletion, c.573_574delCA, p.L193QfsX5, in exon 5 of PITX2A in affected family members. The amino acid alterations, localised in the transcriptional activation domain 2 in the C-terminus of PITX2, were evolutionarily conserved. Mutations in PITX2 have been associated with autosomal-dominant Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome and non-syndromic eye abnormalities, but never been found to cause isolated oral anomalies. Conclusions: This study for the first time demonstrates that the PITX2 mutation could lead to non-syndromic orodental anomalies in humans. We propose that the specific location in the C-terminal domain of PITX2 is exclusively necessary for tooth development."
"Dental properties, ultrastructure, and pulp cells associated with a novel DSPP mutation  2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: To investigate physical characteristics and behaviours of dental pulp cells of teeth isolated from a dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) patient with a novel dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) mutation. Subjects and Methods: Whole exome and Sanger sequencing were employed to identify mutations. Physical characteristics of the teeth were examined. Pulp cells’ behaviours including cell proliferation, colony-forming unit, osteogenic differentiation, pluripotent markers, and mesenchymal stem cell markers were investigated. Results: The proband had opalescent brown primary teeth with extensive loss of enamel. Mutation analysis revealed a novel heterozygous 4-bp deletion, c.1915_1918delAAGT (p.K639QfsX674), in exon 5 of the DSPP associated with DGI. Analysis of the extracted primary incisor demonstrated a decrease in brightness but an increase in yellow and red chroma. The dentin showed reduced mineral density. The dentinal tubules were present in the predentin, but progressively collapsed in the dentin. The pulp cells exhibited markedly reduced CD105 expression, decreased cell proliferation, and smaller colony-forming units. Conclusions: We identified a novel mutation in the DSPP gene which disturbed dentin characteristics and pulp cells’ behaviours. Our study expands the mutation spectrum and understanding of pathologic dentin phenotypes related to the frameshift deletion in the dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) region of the DSPP gene."
"Iloprost Induces Dental Pulp Angiogenesis in a Growth Factor–free 3-Dimensional Organ Culture System  2018 American Association of EndodontistsIntroduction: Angiogenesis is a key determinant in dental pulp regeneration. Iloprost is a synthetic prostacyclin that promotes angiogenesis. A three-dimensional culture that mimics the in vivo condition has been used in tissue engineering. This study investigated the effect of iloprost on promoting dental pulp angiogenesis by using the tooth slice organ culture system. Methods: Tooth slices with intact pulp tissue were cut from molars extracted from 12 patients. Dental pulp tissue viability was determined by live/dead staining. The tooth slices were cultured with iloprost for 1 or 3 days. The microvessel density and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor were determined by immunohistochemical staining. Collagen density was determined by using Masson trichrome and immunofluorescent staining. Results: The pulp tissue in the tooth slices remained viable when cultured in serum-free medium. Iloprost increased the microvessel density as shown by a higher number of von Willebrand factor–positive cells. A significant increase in vascular endothelial growth factor expression was observed in the tooth slices cultured with iloprost. Iloprost stimulated collagen deposition, and this effect was abolished after inhibition of protein kinase A activity. Conclusions: Human tooth slices provide a valuable and easy-to-obtain model to investigate the effect of bioactive molecules used in dental pulp regeneration. This study showed for the first time that tooth slices could be kept viable under serum-free conditions for up to 3 days. Iloprost promoted angiogenesis, increased new vessel formation, and induced collagen deposition. This study proposes the clinical value of iloprost as a drug for inducing angiogenesis that can increase the success of pulp regeneration."
"Fe-based bimetallic catalysts supported on TiO2 for selective CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons  2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.A comparative study was carried out on the CO2 hydrogenation activities and product selectivities of the titania-supported monometallic and bimetallic Fe-based catalysts prepared by one-step wet impregnation. Among the monometallic catalysts (Fe, Co and Cu/TiO2), only Fe/TiO2 catalyst exhibited some selectivity to higher hydrocarbons, while Co/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 were highly selective only to CH4 and CO, respectively. The addition of a small amount of second metal (Co and Cu) on Fe showed the synergetic promotion on the CO2 conversion and the space-time yields (STY) of hydrocarbon products. The incorporation of K and La as promoters can further improve the activity and product selectivity to higher hydrocarbons, indicating that the promoted Fe-based bimetallic catalysts are promising for CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons."
"Canine Bocavirus Type 2 Infection Associated With Intestinal Lesions  2018,  The Author(s) 2018.Bocaviruses are small nonenveloped DNA viruses belonging to the Bocaparvovirus genus of the Parvoviridae family and have been linked to both respiratory and enteric disease in humans and animals. To date, 3 bocaviruses, canine bocaviruses 1 to 3 (CBoV-1–3), have been shown to affect dogs with different disease manifestations reported for infected animals. We used next-generation sequencing to identify a novel strain of canine CBoV-2 (CBoV TH-2016) in a litter of puppies that died in Thailand from acute dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which no causal pathogen could be identified in routine assays. Analysis of the complete coding sequences of CBoV TH-2016 showed that this virus was most closely related to a strain previously identified in South Korea (isolate 14D193), with evidence of genetic recombination in the VP2 gene with related strains from South Korea and Hong Kong. Use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed the presence of CBoV TH-2016 in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous virus spread, while only intestinal tissue was found to be positive by in situ hybridization and electron microscopy. Histologic small intestinal lesions associated with CBoV TH-2016 infection were eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies within villous enterocytes without villous atrophy or fusion, similar to those previously considered pathognomonic for CBoV-1 infection. Therefore, this study provides novel insights in the pathogenicity of canine bocavirus infections and suggests that a novel recombinant CBoV-2 may result in atypical findings of CBoV infection. Although the specific cause of death of these puppies remained undetermined, a contributory role of enteric CBoV TH-2016 infection is possible."
"The CDK inhibitor purvalanol A induces neutrophil apoptosis and increases the turnover rate of Mcl-1: potential role of p38-MAPK in regulation of Mcl-1 turnover  2018 British Society for ImmunologyHuman neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells that do not replicate and yet express a number of enzymes, notably cell cycle-dependent kinases (CDKs), that are associated normally with control of DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. In neutrophils, CDKs appear to function mainly to regulate apoptosis, although the mechanisms by which they regulate this process are largely unknown. Here we show that the CDK2 inhibitor, purvalanol A, induces a rapid decrease in myeloid cell leukaemia factor-1 (Mcl-1) levels in human neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but only induces apoptosis in neutrophils which are dependent upon expression on this protein for survival. This rapid decrease in cellular Mcl-1 protein levels was due to a purvalanol A-induced decrease in stability, with the half-life of the protein decreasing from approximately 2 h in control cells to just over 1 h after addition of the CDK2 inhibitor: it also blocked the granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent stabilization of Mcl-1. Purvanalol A blocked GM-CSF-stimulated activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, and stimulated an additive activation of protein kinase B (Akt) with GM-CSF. Purvalanol A alone stimulated a rapid and sustained activation of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the pan p38-MAPK inhibitor, BIRB796, partly blocked the purvalanol A-induced apoptosis and Mcl-1 loss. These novel effects of purvalanol A may result, at least in part, from blocking GM-CSF-mediated Erk activation. In addition, we propose that purvalanol A-induced activation of p38-MAPK is, at least in part, responsible for its rapid effects on Mcl-1 turnover and acceleration of neutrophil apoptosis."
"Shrimp hemocyte homeostasis-associated protein (PmHHAP) interacts with WSSV134 to control apoptosis in white spot syndrome virus infection  2018 Elsevier LtdHemocyte homeostasis-associated protein (PmHHAP) was first identified as a viral-responsive gene, due to a high upregulation in transcription following white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. Functional studies using RNA interference have suggested that PmHHAP is involved in hemocyte homeostasis by controlling apoptosis during WSSV infection. In this study, the role of PmHHAP in host–viral interactions was further investigated. Yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that PmHHAP binds to an anti-apoptosis protein, WSSV134. The viral protein WSSV134 is a late protein of WSSV, expressed 24 h post infection (hpi). Gene silencing of WSSV134 in WSSV-infected shrimp resulted in a reduction of the expression level of the viral replication marker genes VP28, wsv477, and ie-1, which suggests that WSSV134 is likely involved in viral propagation. However, co-silencing of PmHHAP and WSSV134 counteracted the effects on WSSV infection, which implies the importance of the host–pathogen interaction between PmHHAP and WSSV134 in WSSV infection. In addition, caspase 3/7 activity was noticeably induced in the PmHHAP and WSSV134 co-silenced shrimp upon WSSV infection. Moreover, PmHHAP and WSSV134 inhibited caspase-induced activation of PmCasp in vitro in a non-competitive manner. Taken together, these results suggest that PmHHAP and WSSV134 play a role in the host–pathogen interaction and work concordantly to control apoptosis in WSSV infection."
"Isoferulic acid attenuates methylglyoxal-induced apoptosis in INS-1 rat pancreatic β-cell through mitochondrial survival pathways and increasing glyoxalase-1 activity  2018 Elsevier Masson SASMethylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive precursor to advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which exert deleterious effects on cells and tissues. MG also causes pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis. Isoferulic acid (IFA), a naturally occurring cinnamic acid derivative, is considered to be an antiglycating agent. However, the effect of IFA on MG-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction remains unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the protective effect of IFA against MG-induced mitochrondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells. The results showed that pretreatment of INS-1 cells with 100 μM IFA for 48 h prevented MG-induced decrease in cell viability and impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In addition, 100 μM IFA pretreatment also decreased MG-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) mRNA expression. Furthermore, IFA pretreatment reduced MG-induced increase in caspase-3 activity, suggesting a reduction of apoptotic cell death. IFA (50–100 μM) itself markedly increased the activity of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), a major enzyme for the detoxification of MG. The results showed that 100 μM IFA protected MG-induced loss of GLO1 activity in INS-1 cells. These findings suggest that IFA pretreatment attentuates MG-induced dysfunction and apoptosis in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells through mitochondrial survival pathway and increasing GLO1 activity."
"H2S sensing characteristics of Ni-doped CaCu3Ti4O12 films synthesized by a sol-gel method  2018The problem of detecting the toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas at part per million levels in air by means of simple solid state gas sensors is relevant to environmental and gas processing industries. In this work, high-performance H2S gas sensors are developed based on nickel-doped calcium copper titanate (Ni-doped CCTO) thin films synthesized by a sol-gel method. From gas-sensing measurements, the response of Ni-doped CCTO sensing films increased substantially with increasing Ni doping level from 1.5 to 7.3 wt%, revealing a catalytic effect of Ni on the surface reactions with adsorbed H2S molecules. In particular, 7.3 wt% Ni-doped CCTO sensors offered a high response of 120 for 10 ppm of H2S at the optimal operating temperature of 250 °C, an order of magnitude higher than that of undoped one. In addition, the response time dropped significantly from ∼80 s to ∼4 s while the recovery time slightly improved as the Ni doping content increased from 0 to 7.3 wt%. Moreover, the Ni-doped CCTO sensors exhibited good reproducibility and high H2S selectivity against ethanol, H2, NO2 and NH3. Therefore, the Ni-doped CCTO sensors are highly promising for sensitive and selective detections of H2S."
"Poly(acrylic acid)-grafted magnetite nanoparticle conjugated with pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid for specific adsorption with real DNA  2018 Elsevier B.V.Magnetite nanoparticle conjugated with pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (MNP@PNA) was synthesized for use as both a magnetic nano-support and a probe for specific adsorption with complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). MNP@PNA with the size ranging between 120 and 170 nm in diameter was prepared via a free radical polymerization of acrylic acid in the presence of acrylamide-grafted MNP to obtain negatively charged magnetic nanoclusters, followed by ionic adsorption with PNA. According to fluorescence spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis, this MNP@PNA can differentiate between fully matched, single-base mismatched and fully mismatched synthetic DNAs tagged with different fluorophores. UV–vis spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis indicated that MNP@PNA can be used for specific adsorption with real DNA (zein gene of maize) having complementary sequence with the PNA probe. This novel anionic MNP conjugated with the PNA probe might be potentially applicable for use as a magnetic support for DNA base discrimination and might be a promising tool for testing genetic modification."
"Process and cost modeling of lactic acid recovery from fermentation broths by membrane-based process  2018 Elsevier LtdProcess and cost models for lactic acid recovery from fermentation broths at an annual capacity of 100,000 kg were developed as a research tool to evaluate an alternate process technology. The models were developed using SuperPro® Designer software by gathering the optimized data from the laboratory scale experiments. Sizing of unit operations, chemicals and utility consumptions, and estimation of capital and operating costs with the cost breakdown analysis were acquired from the simulation. A membrane-based process design was proposed in this study. The processes mainly consisted of microfiltration for cell removal, a series of ultrafiltration for eliminating proteins, and the integrated reverse osmosis systems to recover, pre-concentrate, and pre-purify lactic acid. Among the 3 proposed process designs, the in-parallel membrane-based process exhibited the highest lactic acid recovery yield, while the purity remained sufficiently high compared to commercial-grade products. The number of unit operations was found to be responsible for high production cost, in terms of both investment and operating costs. Omitting centrifugation and ultrafiltration at a 30-kDa molecular weight cut-off and use of the in-parallel integrated brackish water reverse-osmosis membrane units could lower operating costs by 23–31% for various fermentation broths that entered the downstream processing units."
"Immunogold-agglutination assay for direct detection of HPV-16 E6 and L1 proteins from clinical specimens  2018 Elsevier B.V.HPV-16 infection is the most common cause of cervical cancer. As HPV-16 transforms the cell, E6 oncoprotein is over-expressed. Therefore, molecular detection of HPV-16 E6 mRNA is now being used for diagnosis and prediction of cancer development. Besides detecting E6 mRNA, a rapid lateral flow detecting the E6 protein using enzyme immunoassay is also now on market with a sensitivity of 53.5% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-3 or more severe (CIN-3+). Here, an immunogold-agglutination assay was developed to detect not only HPV-16 E6 protein but also L1, a major capsid protein found in the productive stage of the virus. Evaluation of this test using HPV-16 DNA positive cervical samples showed that the HPV-16 E6 immunogold-agglutination assay results correlated well with the progression of the cervical lesions, i.e., 10.34% of CIN-1, 68.75% of CIN-3 and 80% of cancer (CaCx) and none for healthy normal samples. Interestingly, the HPV-16 L1 protein was found in most of the cases with cancer indicating the possibility of virion production. Immunogold-agglutination assay for E6 protein is simpler, easier to be performed with a sensitivity of 73.1% for CIN-3+ suggesting a good method for laboratory diagnostic use."
"Changes in physicochemical properties and starch crystallinity of sponge cake containing HPMC and extra virgin coconut oil during room temperature storage  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Starch retrogradation is an important factor affecting cake firmness. Effects of hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) at 0.5% (w/w) or extra virgin coconut oil (EVCO) at 20% (w/w), either alone or together, on physicochemical properties and starch crystallinity of sponge cake during storage was investigated. Addition of EVCO increased specific volume and expansion ratio, while addition of HPMC increased water activity of the freshly baked sponge cake. Changes in firmness, moisture, and spin-lattice relaxation time from nuclear magnetic resonance (T1) of sponge cakes followed a first-order kinetic reaction. Use of HPMC and/or EVCO in sponge cake could retard the firmness rate in the following order: EVCO + HPMC, < EVCO < HPMC < control (no HPMC and EVCO). The Avrami model satisfactorily fitted the retrogradation kinetics data. The growth of remainder crystals was slower in the presence of EVCO + HPMC, while both the nucleation and growth rates of new crystals were slower with 20% EVCO. Practical applications: Deterioration of sponge cake during storage is a major problem and can be costly to the bakery industry. HPMC and Extra virgin coconut oil could retard a firmness rate of sponge cake during storage. The kinetic modeling can be applied for tracking quality changes in sponge cake. Lipid decreases starch crystal growth and a nucleation rate in sponge cake. Firmness of sponge cake is directly related to the degree of starch crystallization. This research can be beneficial to the industrial cake production for improvement of product shelf life."
"Biosorption of heavy metals by obligate halophilic fungi  2018 Elsevier LtdThe presence of heavy metals in the environment poses a serious threat to human health. Remediation of this problem using microorganisms has been widely researched to find a sustainable solution. Obligate halophilic fungi comprising Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus gracilis, Aspergillus penicillioides (sp. 1), Aspergillus penicillioides (sp. 2), Aspergillus restrictus and Sterigmatomyces halophilus were used for the biosorption of cadmium, copper, ferrous, manganese, lead and zinc. The metals were supplemented as salts in potato dextrose broth for the growth of obligate halophilic fungi and incubated for 14 days. The supernatant and biomass were obtained by the acid digestion method. The biosorption was screened by atomic absorption spectroscopy. All tested fungi showed moderate to high adsorption of heavy metals, amongst which A. flavus and S. halophilus showed the best average adsorption of all heavy metals studied, with an average of 86 and 83%, respectively. On average, Fe and Zn are best removed from the liquid media of obligate halophilic fungi, with an average of 85 and 84%, respectively. This pioneering study of biosorption by obligate halophilic fungi using inexpensive media in stagnant conditions provides a cost-effective environmental solution for the removal of heavy metals."
"Improved heterologous expression of the membrane-bound quinoprotein quinate dehydrogenase from Gluconobacter oxydans  2018 Elsevier Inc.Gluconobacter oxydans produces 3-dehydroquinate by oxidation of quinate through a reaction catalyzed by the quinate dehydrogenase (QDH), membrane-bound, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent dehydrogenase. We previously reported the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of QDH and constructed a heterologous expression system of QDH in Pseudomonas sp. (A.S. Vangnai, W. Promden, W. De-Eknamkul, K. Matsushita, H. Toyama, Biochemistry (Moscow) 75:452–459, 2010). Through this study, we aim to update the sequences of QDH and improve the heterologous expression of QDH in Gluconobacter strains using a broad-host-range plasmid. Expression of QDH using a plasmid containing a long 5′-UTR was higher than that using a plasmid with a short 5′-UTR. In addition, the usage of the putative promoter region of the membrane-bound, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) of Gluconobacter resulted in higher expression levels compared to the usage of the lacZ promoter. Base substitution experiments allowed to identify the correct TTG initiation codon between two possibilities, and the result of these experiments were consistent with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the expressed QDH. However, change of the TTG codon to ATG did not increase QDH expression. Therefore, the optimal plasmid for QDH expression included the structural gene with a long 5′-UTR and the ADH promoter. Cell membrane of the recombinant Gluconobacter strain presented approximately 10-times higher specific QDH activity than that observed in the wild-type strain."
"Identification and production of mouse scFv to specific epitope of enterovirus-71 virion protein-2 (VP2)  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.Enterovirus-71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus-A16 (CA16) frequently cause hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) epidemics among infants and young children. CA16 infections are usually mild, while EV71 disease may be fatal due to neurologic complications. As such, the ability to rapidly and specifically recognize EV71 is needed to facilitate proper case management and epidemic control. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to generate antibodies to EV71-virion protein-2 (VP2) by phage display technology for further use in specific detection of EV71. A recombinant peptide sequence of EV71-VP2, carrying a predicted conserved B cell epitope fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (designated GST-EV71-VP2/131-160), was produced. The fusion protein was used as bait in in-solution biopanning to separate protein-bound phages from a murine scFv (MuscFv) phage display library constructed from an immunoglobulin gene repertoire from naïve ICR mice. Three phage-transformed E. coli clones (clones 63, 82, and 83) produced MuscFvs that bound to the GST-EV71-VP2/131-160 peptide. The MuscFv of clone 83 (MuscFv83), which produced the highest ELISA signal to the target antigen, was further tested. MuscFv83 also bound to full-length EV71-VP2 and EV71 particles, but did not bind to GST, full-length EV71-VP1, or the antigenically related CA16. MuscFv83 could be a suitable reagent for rapid antigen-based immunoassay, such as immunochromatography (ICT), for the specific detection and/or diagnosis of EV71 infection as well as epidemic surveillance."
"Getting a good night sleep? The importance of recognizing and treating nocturnal hypokinesia in Parkinson's disease  2018 Elsevier LtdWhen Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are asked about the quality of their sleep, their answers are dominated by difficulties associated with impaired mobility in bed, medically referred to as nocturnal hypokinesia. Nocturnal hypokinesia is symptomatic from the mid-stage of the disease, affecting up to 70% of PD patients, and contributes to poor sleep quality, and increased carer burden. Here we explore four areas of nocturnal hypokinesia that are relevant to clinical practice, namely: manifestations and definition; clinical assessment and objective monitoring; etiologies and contributing factors; and evidence-based therapeutic approaches. In addition, we provide an operational definition of what constitutes nocturnal hypokinesia and outline different methods of assessment, ranging from clinical interviews and rating scales to objective night-time monitoring with inertial sensors. Optimal management of nocturnal hypokinesia in PD begins with recognizing its manifestation by inquiring about cardinal symptoms and contributing factors from, not only patients, but also carers, followed by formal assessment, and the application of individualized evidence-based treatment. Night-time dopaminergic treatment is the primary therapy; however, careful clinical judgment is required to balance the benefits with the potential adverse events related to nocturnal dopaminergic stimulation. Future studies are needed to explore the practicality of home-based objective assessment of nocturnal hypokinesia, new therapeutic options not limited to dopaminergic medications, and non-pharmacologic approaches, including training on compensatory strategies and bedroom adaptations."
"A randomized phase III study between sequential versus simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinomaEine randomisierte Phase-III-Studie für den Vergleich zwischen intensitätsmodulierter Strahlentherapie mit sequenziell oder mit simultan integriertem Boost bei Nasopharynxkarzinom  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: This study was performed to compare the acute and late toxicities between sequential (SEQ) and simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Materials and methods: Stage I-IVB NPC patients were randomized to receive SEQ-IMRT or SIB-IMRT. SEQ-IMRT consisted of two plans: 2 Gy × 25 fractions to low-risk planning target volume (PTV) followed by a sequential boost (2 Gy × 10 fractions) to high-risk PTV, while SIB-IMRT treated low- and high-risk PTVs with doses of 56 and 70 Gy in 33 fractions. Toxicities and survival outcomes were analyzed. Results: Between October 2010 and September 2015, of the 209 patients who completed treatment, 102 in the SEQ and 107 in the SIB arm were analyzed. The majority had undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma (82%). Mucositis and dysphagia were the most common grade 3–5 acute toxicities. There were no statistically significant differences in the cumulative incidence of grade 3–4 acute toxicities between the two arms (59.8% in SEQ vs. 58.9% in SIB; P = 0.892). Common grade 3–4 late toxicities for SEQ and SIB included hearing loss (2.9 vs. 8.4%), temporal lobe injury (2.9 vs. 0.9%), cranial nerve injury (0 vs. 2.8%), and xerostomia (2 vs. 0.9%). With the median follow-up of 41 months, 3‑year progression-free and overall survival rates were 72.7 vs. 73.4% (P = 0.488) and 86.3 vs. 83.6% (P = 0.938), respectively. Conclusion: SEQ and SIB provide excellent survival outcomes with few late toxicities. According to our study, SIB with a satisfactory dose–volume constraint to nearby critical organs is the technique of choice for NPC treatment due to its convenience."
"Pediatric cleft palate patients show a 3- to 5-fold increase in cumulative radiation exposure from dental radiology compared with an age- and gender-matched population: a retrospective cohort study  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objective: The objective of the study was to compare estimates of pediatric cumulative exposure and lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of radiation-induced cancer from dental radiology between cleft palate (CP) subjects and age- and gender-matched controls (non-CP), with and without orthodontic treatment. Materials and methods: The radiation exposure frequency of CP subjects and non-CP controls with and without orthodontic treatment was compared for two-dimensional radiography (intra-oral, panoramic and cephalometric radiography), computed tomography (CT), and cone-beam CT (CBCT) using cumulative radiation dose as an estimate. From this dose estimate, the age- and gender-dependent risk for radiation-induced stochastic effects was calculated for each patient group. Results: CP patients received more radiographic examinations than non-CP controls, with the exception of intra-oral radiographs. The cumulative dose to CP patients was considerably higher (1963 μSv at the age of 20 years) than non-CP patients with (597 μSv) and without (383 μSv) orthodontic treatment, primarily due to the higher frequency of CT scanning. Accordingly, CP patients had a three to five times higher LAR than non-CP patients. Conclusions: This study suggests a significantly higher lifetime radiation exposure to CP patients than non-CP controls from dental radiographic procedures. Diagnostic benefits from the use of CT and CBCT in children must be justified and appropriate dose optimization strategies implemented. Clinical relevance: The present study indicates the need for proper justification and optimization of pediatric exposures in dentistry, with a special focus on high-risk groups."
"Are endocrine disrupting compounds environmental risk factors for autism spectrum disorder?  2017 Elsevier Inc.Recent research on the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has shifted in part from a singular focus on genetic causes to the involvement of environmental factors and their gene interactions. This shift in focus is a result of the rapidly increasing prevalence of ASD coupled with the incomplete penetrance of this disorder in monozygotic twins. One such area of environmentally focused research is the association of exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) with elevated risk for ASD. EDCs are exogenous chemicals that can alter endogenous hormone activity and homeostasis, thus potentially disrupting the action of sex and other natural hormones at all stages of human development. Inasmuch as sex hormones play a fundamental role in brain development and sexual differentiation, exposure to EDCs in utero during critical stages of development can have lasting neurological and other physiological influences on the developing fetus and, ultimately, the child as well as adult. This review will focus on the possible contributions of EDCs to autism risk and pathogenesis by first discussing the influence of endogenous sex hormones on the autistic phenotype, followed by a review of documented human exposures to EDCs and associations with behaviors relevant to ASD. Mechanistic links between EDC exposures and aberrant neurodevelopment and behaviors are then considered, with emphasis on EDC-induced transcriptional profiles derived from animal and cellular studies. Finally, this review will discuss possible mechanisms through which EDC exposure can lead to persistent changes in gene expression and phenotype, which may in turn contribute to transgenerational inheritance of ASD."
"Investigation of Stability and Failure Mechanism of Undercut Slopes by Three-Dimensional Finite Element Analysis  2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.Slope failures along a bedding plane were critical issues and mostly happened in an open pit mining project such as the Mae Moh Mine, Thailand. The prediction of maximum width to maintain stable slope after an excavation process is required. This paper presents an investigation of 3D finite element analysis for the stability and failure mechanism of undercut slopes resting on a low interface friction plane. In numerical models, the soil slope was modeled as volume elements with the hardening soil material. Interface elements were used at the bottom plane to simulate the low interface friction plane and at the side support to simulate fully rough surface for the models with side supports. Stage analyses in numerical models were performed following excavation processes in physical models until failure. The effects of the side support and the slope length to increase the stability of undercut slopes were considered. Failure widths, failure mechanisms, and stress distributions associated with slope angles and boundary conditions of side support were discussed and compared."
"Peripheral Alterations in Cytokine and Chemokine Levels After Antidepressant Drug Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Mounting evidence suggests that aberrations in immune-inflammatory pathways contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), and individuals with MDD may have elevated levels of predominantly pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein. In addition, previous meta-analyses suggest that antidepressant drug treatment may decrease peripheral levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6. Recently, several new studies examining the effect of antidepressants on these cytokines have been published, and so we performed an updated meta-analysis of studies that measured peripheral levels of cytokines and chemokines during antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD. The PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo databases were searched from inception through March 9, 2017. Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria (N = 1517). Peripheral levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, interferon-γ, IL-8, the C-C motif ligand 2 chemokine (CCL-2), CCL-3, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-13, IL-17, IL-5, IL-7, and the soluble IL-2 receptor were measured in at least three datasets and thus were meta-analyzed. Antidepressant treatment significantly decreased peripheral levels of IL-6 (Hedges g = −0.454, P <0.001), TNF-α (g = −0.202, P = 0.015), IL-10 (g = −0.566, P = 0.012), and CCL-2 (g = −1.502, P = 0.006). These findings indicate that antidepressants decrease several markers of peripheral inflammation. However, this meta-analysis did not provide evidence that reductions in peripheral inflammation are associated with antidepressant treatment response although few studies provided separate data for treatment responders and non-responders."
"Zika Virus as an Emerging Neuropathogen: Mechanisms of Neurovirulence and Neuro-Immune Interactions  2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus of the genus Flaviviridae, which causes a febrile illness and has spread from across the Pacific to the Americas in a short timeframe. Convincing evidence has implicated the ZIKV to incident cases of neonatal microcephaly and a set of neurodevelopmental abnormalities referred to as the congenital Zika virus syndrome. In addition, emerging data points to an association with the ZIKV and the development of the so-called Guillain-Barre syndrome, an acute autoimmune polyneuropathy. Accumulating knowledge suggests that neurovirulent strains of the ZIKV have evolved from less pathogenic lineages of the virus. Nevertheless, mechanisms of neurovirulence and host-pathogen neuro-immune interactions remain incompletely elucidated. This review provides a critical discussion of genetic and structural alterations in the ZIKV which could have contributed to the emergence of neurovirulent strains. In addition, a mechanistic framework of neuro-immune mechanisms related to the emergence of neuropathology after ZIKV infection is discussed. Recent advances in knowledge point to avenues for the development of a putative vaccine as well as novel therapeutic strategies. Nevertheless, there are unique unmet challenges that need to be addressed in this regard. Finally, a research agenda is proposed."
"Practical Approach in Developing Desirable Peel–Seal and Clear Lidding Films Based on Poly(Lactic Acid) and Poly(Butylene Adipate-Co-Terephthalate) Blends Copyright  2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.In this research, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blend with poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) were selected to fabricate peelable lidding films. In general, blending PLA with PBAT results in hazy films; however, desirable low haze films (<10%) could be achieved in this study by designing proper blend composition and cast film process under optimum conditions. Based on various blends containing PBAT ranging from 15 to 30% by weight, it could be seen that a PBAT/PLA blend of 20/80 showed desired optical and peel–seal property, which had a haze of <10% and low peel strength in an easy-peel characteristic. It was also observed that not only the blend composition but also the film thickness could influence both optical and peel–seal behaviours because the bulk morphology and surface irregularities of the films could vary by changing films' thicknesses. Thus, cast extruded pristine and PBAT/PLA (20/80) blend films of three different thicknesses (20, 35 and 50 μm) were studied. Peel–seal behaviour and optical properties of these films were examined. An I-peel test (180°) of films sealed on PLA sheet (thickness of ~350 μm) with different interfacial sealing temperature illustrated failure mechanism of four types, i.e. tearing, partial tearing, cohesive and adhesive failure. Based on this study, the PBAT/PLA of 20/80 wt% films with thickness of 20 μm can be used as easy-peel lidding film sealed with PLA container. Such PBAT/PLA blend films possess a low haze of ~4% and a low peel strength of 8–10 N/15 mm at a broad range of interfacial sealing temperature of 76–105°C. Copyright  2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Preparation of poly(methyl methacrylate)-Silica nanoparticles via differential microemulsion polymerization and physical properties of NR/PMMA-SiO2 hybrid membranes  2017 Society of Plastics EngineersPoly(methy methacrylate) (PMMA)-SiO2 nanoparticles were prepared via differential microemulsion polymerization. The effects of silica loading, surfactant concentration, and initiator concentration on monomer conversion, particle size, particle size distribution, grafting efficiency, and silica encapsulation efficiency were investigated. A high monomer conversion of 99.9% and PMMA-SiO2 nanoparticles with a size range of 30 to 50 nm were obtained at a low surfactant concentration of 5.34 wt% based on monomer. PMMA-SiO2 nanoparticles showed spherical particles with a core-shell morphology by TEM micrographs. A nanocomposite membrane from natural rubber (NR) and PMMA-SiO2 emulsion was studied for mechanical and thermal properties and pervaporation of water-ethanol mixtures. PMMA-SiO2 nanoparticles which were uniformly dispersed in NR matrix, significantly enhanced mechanical properties and showed high water selectivity in permeate flux. Thus, the NR/PMMA-SiO2 hybrid membranes have great potential for pervaporation process in membrane applications. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2017.  2017 Society of Plastics Engineers."
"Effects of analcime zeolite synthesized from local pottery stone as nucleating agent on crystallization behaviors and mechanical properties of isotactic polypropylene  2017 Society of Plastics EngineersThis study reported the synthesis of analcime zeolite (AN-zeolite) from a local pottery stone via hydrothermal method using 2 M NaOH at 120°C for 8 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The as-synthesized AN-zeolite was characterized for its phase composition, morphology, and particle size using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering analysis, respectively. Subsequently, the AN-zeolite was used as a nucleating agent for isotactic polypropylene (iPP). The prepared nucleated iPP was analyzed for its crystallization behaviors (by XRD, polarized optical microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry), mechanical properties (impact strength and tensile properties), and morphology. It was found that the AN-zeolite can induce to form a mass of α-crystal and only a little β-crystal in the iPP, along with the significant increase in the nuclei content, crystallization rate, and crystallization temperature, but a substantial decrease in the spherulite size. In addition, the incorporation of an appropriate amount of the AN-zeolite into the iPP caused an increase in the impact strength (at 1.25 wt% optimal), tensile strength (at 1.25 wt% optimal), and Young's modulus (at 2 wt% optimal), but a deterioration of the elongation at break with increasing AN-zeolite content compared with the neat iPP.

"Poly(vinyl chloride)/Poly(butylene succinate)/wood flour composites: Physical properties and biodegradability  2016 Society of Plastics EngineersThis work aimed to improve the toughness and biodegradability of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) by inclusion of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and wood flour (WF). The PVC/PBS blends (10–50 wt% PBS) showed a PBS-dose-dependent increase in the impact strength, elongation at break, and biodegradability compared to the neat PVC. According to the optimum impact strength and elongation at break, the 80/20 (w/w) PVC/PBS blend was further filled with three loading levels of WF (10, 20, and 30 parts by weight per hundred parts of blend resin). The resulting PVC/PBS/WF composites showed a significant increase in the tensile modulus, flexural strength, flexural modulus, heat deflection temperature (HDT), water uptake, and biodegradability, but only a slight increase in the hardness and glass transition temperature, accompanied with a decrease in the impact strength, tensile strength, elongation at break, and Vicat softening point compared to the neat 80/20 (w/w) blend. It can be concluded that PBS played an important role both in toughening and increasing the biodegradability of PVC/PBS blends while WF caused an increase in the stiffness, HDT, and also the biodegradability of PVC/PBS/WF composites.

"Thermodynamic parameters and isotherm application on enantiomeric separation of levofloxacin using hollow fiber supported liquid membrane system  2017 Elsevier B.V.The thermodynamic parameters ΔH, ΔS and ΔG on enantiomeric separation of levofloxacin were determined. The activation energy (Ea) of the reaction between levofloxacin and (-)-DBTA was 72.96 kJ mol−1. Percentages of extraction and recovery of levofloxacin were 88.35% and 85.57%, respectively. Enantiomeric excess (% e.e.) was found to be 80.00%. Further, Langmuir isotherm was applied to the HFSLM system. Thus, it was noted that the Langmuir isotherm showed good agreement with the experimental data with a percentage deviation of 2.29%."
"Preferential nucleation, guiding, and blocking of self-propelled droplets by dislocations  2018 Author(s).Lattice-mismatched layers of GaAs/InGaAs are grown on GaAs(001) using molecular beam epitaxy and subsequently heated in vacuum while the surface is imaged in situ using low-energy electron microscopy, in order to study (i) the nucleation of group-III droplets formed as a result of noncongruent sublimation and (ii) the dynamics of these self-propelled droplets as they navigate the surface. It is found that the interfacial misfit dislocation network not only influences the nucleation sites of droplets, but also exerts unusual steering power over their subsequent motion. Atypical droplet flow patterns including 90° and 180° turns are found. The directions of these dislocations-guided droplets are qualitatively explained in terms of in-plane and out-of-plane stress fields associated with the buried dislocations and the driving forces due to chemical potential and stress gradients typical of Marangoni flow. The findings would benefit processes and devices that employ droplets as catalysts or active structures such as droplet epitaxy of quantum nanostructures, vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanowires, or the fabrication of self-integrated circuits."
"New location recommendation technique on social network  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.With the availability of current modern technologies, decisions making in an everyday life can be assist in many different ways. Many researches in the past decade has studied about recommendation systems. Recommendation systems can base on different variables with location-based services is one of the more interesting factor to a recommendation system. Recommendations on Location based Network is a service for assisting people to locate locations of their interests. A large number of recorded checked-in histories was gathered to make the prediction according to the desired preferences of each user. Furthermore, determinations have shown a social relationship leading to availability of information will assist in making better recommendations based on the locations. Recently, the recommendation system on location-based domain usually combines either content-based technique and collaborative technique, or collaborative technique and social-based techniques. It is difficult to find the way to combine those three techniques. So there is no research that combine those techniques on location-based recommendation system. This study proposes a new method that combines content-based technique, collaborative technique, and social-based techniques; to produce more efficient result results than location-based RS methods. The evaluation results show that the proposed method provide higher accuracy and coverage than two current location methods by measuring with the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and coverage matrix."

"Modulation of Neuronal Activity on Intercalated Neurons of Amygdala Might Underlie Anxiolytic Activity of a Standardized Extract of Centella asiatica ECa233  2018 Aree Wanasuntronwong et al.GABAergic intercalated neurons of amygdala (ITCs) have recently been shown to be important in the suppression of fear-like behavior. Effects of ECa233 (a standardized extract of Centella asiatica), previously demonstrated anxiolytic activity, were then investigated on ITCs. Cluster of GABAergic neurons expressing fluorescence of GFP was identified in GAD67-GFP knock-in mice. We found that neurons of medial paracapsular ITC were GABAergic neurons exhibiting certain intrinsic electrophysiological properties similar to those demonstrated by ITC neurons at the same location in C57BL/6J mice. Therefore, we conducted experiments in both C57BL/6J mice and GAD67-GFP knock-in mice. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked by stimulation of the external capsule during the whole cell patch-clamp recordings from ITC neurons in brain slices. ECa233 was found to increase the EPSC peak amplitude in the ITC neurons by about 120%. The EPSCs in ITC neurons were completely abolished by the application of an AMPA receptor antagonist. Morphological assessment of the ITC neurons with biocytin demonstrated that most axons of the recorded neurons innervated the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Therefore, it is highly likely that anxiolytic activity of ECa233 was mediated by increasing activation, via AMPA receptors, of excitatory synaptic input to the GABAergic ITC leading to depression of CeA neurons."
"Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Molecular Copper-Porphyrin Supported on Titanium Dioxide Nanotubes  2018 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.We report on a self-assembled system comprising a molecular copper-porphyrin photoelectrocatalyst, 5-(4-carboxy-phenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrinatocopper(II) (CuTPP-COOH), covalently bound to self-organized, anodic titania nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTs) for photoelectrochemical reduction of oxygen. Visible light irradiation of the porphyrin-covered TiO2 NTs under cathodic polarization up to −0.3 V vs. Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) photocatalytically produces H2O2 in pH neutral electrolyte, at room temperature and without need of sacrificial electron donors. The formation of H2O2 upon irradiation is proven and quantified by direct colorimetric detection using 4-nitrophenyl boronic acid (p-NPBA) as a reactant. This simple approach for the attachment of a small molecular catalyst to TiO2 NTs may ultimately allow for the preparation of a low-cost H2O2 evolving cathode for efficient photoelectrochemical energy storage under ambient conditions."
"Optimal Representation for Right-to-Left Parallel Scalar Point Multiplication  2017 IEEE.This paper introduces an optimal representation for a right-to-left parallel elliptic curve scalar point multiplication. The right-to-left approach is easier to parallelize than the conventional left-to-right approach. However, unlike the left-to-right approach, there is still no work considering number representations for the right-to-left parallel calculation. By simplifying the implementation by Robert, we devise a mathematical model to capture the computation time of the calculation. Then, for any arbitrary amount of doubling time and addition time, we propose algorithms to generate representations which minimize the time in that model. As a result, we can show a negative result that a conventional representation like NAF is almost optimal. The parallel computation time obtained from any representation cannot be better than NAF by more than 1%."
"Constraints on the chiral magnetic effect using charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in pPb and PbPb collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider 2018 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration. Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI.Charge-dependent azimuthal correlations of same- and opposite-sign pairs with respect to the second- and third-order event planes have been measured in pPb collisions at sNN=8.16TeV and PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The measurement is motivated by the search for the charge separation phenomenon predicted by the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy ion collisions. Three- and two-particle azimuthal correlators are extracted as functions of the pseudorapidity difference, the transverse momentum (pT) difference, and the pT average of same- and opposite-charge pairs in various event multiplicity ranges. The data suggest that the charge-dependent three-particle correlators with respect to the second- and third-order event planes share a common origin, predominantly arising from charge-dependent two-particle azimuthal correlations coupled with an anisotropic flow. The CME is expected to lead to a v2-independent three-particle correlation when the magnetic field is fixed. Using an event shape engineering technique, upper limits on the v2-independent fraction of the three-particle correlator are estimated to be 13% for pPb and 7% for PbPb collisions at 95% confidence level. The results of this analysis, both the dominance of two-particle correlations as a source of the three-particle results and the similarities seen between PbPb and pPb, provide stringent constraints on the origin of charge-dependent three-particle azimuthal correlations and challenge their interpretation as arising from a chiral magnetic effect in heavy ion collisions."
"Photoinduced glycerol oxidation over plasmonic au and aum (M = Pt, Pd and Bi) nanoparticle-decorated TiO2 photocatalysts  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this study, sol-immobilization was used to prepare gold nanoparticle (Au NP)-decorated titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts at different Au weight % (wt. %) loading (Aux/TiO2, where x is the Au wt. %) and Au–M NP-decorated TiO2 photocatalysts (Au3M3/TiO2), where M is bismuth (Bi), platinum (Pt) or palladium (Pd) at 3 wt. %. The Aux/TiO2 photocatalysts exhibited a stronger visible light absorption than the parent TiO2 due to the localized surface plasmon resonance effect. Increasing the Au content from 1 wt. % to 7 wt. % led to increased visible light absorption due to the increasing presence of defective structures that were capable of enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared catalyst. The addition of Pt and Pd coupled with the Au3/TiO2 to form Au3M3/TiO2 improved the photocatalytic activity of the Au3/TiO2 photocatalyst by maximizing their light-absorption property. The Au3/TiO2, Au3Pt3/TiO2 and Au3Pd3/TiO2 photocatalysts promoted the formation of glyceraldehyde from glycerol as the principle product, while Au3Bi3/TiO2 facilitated glycolaldehyde formation as the major product. Among all the prepared photocatalysts, Au3Pd3/TiO2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity with a 98.75% glycerol conversion at 24 h of reaction time."
"Photoautotrophic cultivating options of freshwater green microalgal Chlorococcum humicola for biomass and carotenoid production  2018 Taylor & Francis.Photoautotrophic cultivation of Chlorococcum humicola was performed in batch and continuous modes in different cultivating system arrangements to compare biomass and carotenoids’ concentration and their productivities. Batch result from stirred tank and airlift photobioreactors indicated the positive effect of increasing light intensity on growth and carotenoid production, whereas the finding from continuous cultivation indicated that carotenoid enhancement preferred high light intensity and nitrogen-deficient environment. The highest biomass (1.31 ± 0.04 g L−1) and carotenoid (4.59 ± 0.06 mg L−1) concentration as well as the highest productivities, 0.46 g L−1 d−1 for biomass and 1.61 mg L−1 d−1 for carotenoids, were obtained when maintaining high light intensity of 10 klx, BG-11 medium and 2% (v/v) CO2 simultaneously, while the highest carotenoid content (4.84 mg g−1) was associated with high light intensity and nitrogen-deficient environment, which was induced by feed-modified BG-11 growth medium containing nitrate 20 folds lower than the original medium. Finally, the cultivating system arranged into smaller stirred tank photobioreactors in series yielded approximately 2.5 folds increase in both biomass and carotenoid productivities relative to using single airlift photobioreactor with equivalent working volume and similar operating condition."
"Estrogen receptor beta expression and prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Objectives: Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ)-selective agonists inhibited B cell lymphoma growth in animal models. However, a recent study found that higher ERβ expression in tissue from diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients indicated a poorer survival. This study aimed to determine the ERβ expression in DLBCL tissue using immunohistochemistry and correlate with clinical outcomes. Methods: Diagnostic tissues from newly diagnosed adult DLBCL patients treated with Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide/Doxorubicin/Vincristine/Prednisolone were counted for ERβ1-expressing cells. Nodal lymphoma (N = 41) was analyzed separately from extra-nodal DLBCL (N = 31). Results: On immunohistochemistry, ERβ1 was expressed in 73.6% of cases with the median expressing cells of 20%. For nodal lymphoma, high ERβ expression (≥25%) was associated with poorer event free survival (EFS) independent of the international prognostic index with the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.49 (95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.03–6.00, P = 0.042). On the contrary, high ERβ expression (≥25%) was associated with superior outcomes in extra-nodal DLBCL with the adjusted HR of 0.25 (95% CI 0.09–0.75, P = 0.013) for EFS and adjusted HR of 0.29 (95% CI 0.10–0.85, P = 0.024) for overall survival in multivariate analyses. Conclusion: ERβ1 protein expression represented opposite prognostic factors in nodal vs. extra-nodal DLBCL."
"Observation and explanation of two-dimensional interconversion of oximes with multiple heart-cutting using comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography  2018 Elsevier B.V.Real-time interconversion processes produce unconventional peak broadening in gas chromatography (GC), and can be used to generate kinetic and thermodynamic data. In this study, an unusual separation situation in comprehensive two dimensional GC where two dimensional interconversion (i.e. a raised plateau in both first and second dimension, 1D and 2D) was observed in analysis of oxime isomers. This resulted in a characteristic and unusual rectangular peak shape in the two dimensional result. A related theoretical approach was introduced to explain the peak shape supported by simulation results which can be varied depending on concentration profiles and kinetics of the process. The simulated results were supported by experimental results obtained by a comprehensive heart-cut multidimensional GC (H/C MDGC) approach which was developed to clearly investigate isomerisation of E/Z oxime molecules in both 1D and 2D separations under different isothermal conditions. The carrier gas flow and oven temperature were selected according to initial results for 1D interconversion on a poly(ethyleneglycol) stationary phase, which was further used in both 1D and 2D separations to result in broad zones of oxime interconversion in both dimensions. The method involved repetitive injections of oxime sample, then sampling contiguous fractions of sample into a long 2D column which is intended to promote considerable interconversion. Comprehensiveness arises from the fact that the whole sample is sampled from the 1D to the 2D column, with the long 2D column replacing the short 2D column used in classical comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography, where the latter will not promote sufficient interconversion. Data processing and presentation permits a ‘rectangular’ distribution corresponding to the separated compounds, characteristic of this experiment."
"Associations of Grip Strength and Change in Grip Strength With All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality in a European Older Population  The Author(s) 2018.Objective: (1) To examine the associations between 3 measures of grip strength: static grip strength, change in grip strength, and the combination of grip strength and its change, with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and (2) to determine which measure is the most powerful predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among the European older population. Method: Data come from the first 4 waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). A Cox proportional hazard model and a competing risk regression model were used to assess the associations. To determine the best predictor, Akaike information criterion was applied. Results: Grip strength and the combination of grip strength and its change were associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Change in grip strength was correlated with only all-cause mortality. Among the 3 measures, the static measure of grip strength was the best predictor of cardiovascular mortality whereas the combined measure is that of all-cause mortality. Discussion: Grip strength is a significant indicator of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The combination of grip strength and its change can be used to increase the accuracy for prediction of all-cause mortality among older persons."
"Estimating user story points using document fingerprints  2017 IEEE.In Scrum process, there are several techniques for estimating user story points such as planning poker, expert judgment and analogy. The effort estimation might be performed by the inexperienced team members who are unfamiliar with the particular business domain involved. To improve the estimation performance, the historical data of the similar user story points from the previous successful projects are considered useful and guiding as the analogous estimation. In this paper, we exploit an alternative searching technique, called the document fingerprints, to retrieve the similar issues from the public repository of project management assets, called JIRA. We also use MMRE and Benchmarking class to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our searching algorithm. The results show that the document fingerprints technique works reasonably well, especially for the user stories regarding the existing business domain."
"Translating TOSCA into docker-compose YAML file using ANTLR  2017 IEEE.In recent years, Docker is rapidly a powerful and better efficient deployment environment in software as a service (SaaS) development. Using Docker in a software project could solve many former DevOps problems and increase quality of the project. The Docker-Compose is an official tool that helps manage Docker containers by defining the appropriate SaaS configuration in a docker-compose YAML file. As it is not easy for newbies of Docker to write a docker-compose YAML file due to the complicated parameters of a large compounded services' configurations, the TOCSA diagramming should alternatively provide several service templates which are more practical and adequately descriptive to the common SaaS designers. In this paper, we encourage and provide the SaaS designer a set of predefined TOSCA service templates to configure the target SaaS project. Then, we propose a mean to translate the configured TOSCA diagram into docker-compose YAML file using ANTLR. The resulting docker-compose YAML file could be readily exploited in Docker environment."
"Early versus standard initiation of renal replacement therapy in furosemide stress test non-responsive acute kidney injury patients (the FST trial)  2018 The Author(s).Background: The timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in severe acute kidney injury (AKI) remains controversial, with early initiation resulting in unnecessary therapy for some patients while expectant therapy may delay RRT for other patients. The furosemide stress test (FST) has been shown to predict the need for RRT and therefore could be used to exclude low-risk patients from enrollment in trials of RRT timing. We conducted this multicenter pilot study to determine whether FST could be used to screen patients at high risk for RRT and to determine the feasibility of incorporating FST into a trial of early initiation of RRT. Methods: FST was performed using intravenous furosemide (1 mg/kg in furosemide-naive patients or 1.5 mg/kg in previous furosemide users). FST-nonresponsive patients (urine output less than 200 mL in 2 h) were then randomized to early (initiation within 6 h) or standard (initiation by urgent indication) RRT. Results: FST was completed in all patients (100%). Only 6/44 (13.6%) FST-responsive patients ultimately received RRT while 47/60 (78.3%) nonresponders randomized to standard RRT either received RRT or died (P < 0.001). Among 118 FST-nonresponsive patients, 98.3% in the early RRT arm and 75% in the standard RRT arm received RRT. The adherence to the protocol was 94.8% and 100% in the early and standard RRT group, respectively. We observed no differences in 28-day mortality (62.1 versus 58.3%, P = 0.68), 7-day fluid balance, or RRT dependence at day 28. However, hypophosphatemia occurred more frequently in the early RRT arm (P = 0.002). Conclusion: The furosemide stress test appears to be feasible and effective in identifying patients for randomization to different RRT initiation times. Our findings should guide implementation of large-scale randomized controlled trials for the timing of RRT initiation."
"Patients’ attitude toward diabetes mellitus screening in Thai dental clinics  Chanita Tantipoj, Narin Hiransuthikul, Sirirak Supa-amornkul, Vitool Lohsoonthorn and Siribang-on Piboonniyom Khovidhunkit.Purpose – Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important health problem throughout the world. Association between DM and oral diseases has been reported and dental clinic is indicated to be one of the suitable venues for the screening of DM. The purpose of this paper is to determine patients’ attitude toward DM screening in dental clinics. Design/methodology/approach – The anonymous, self-administered questionnaires of five-point response scale questions were distributed to convenience samples of adult patients (⩾ 25 years) attending one of the dental settings. These dental settings were divided into the university/hospital-based dental clinics (encompassing two university-based and five hospital-based dental clinics) or the private dental clinics (encompassing two private, and one special (after office hour) clinic of a faculty of dentistry). The questions could be categorized into three groups regarding importance, willingness, and agreement of DM screening in dental settings. Results are presented as percentage by respondents based upon the number of responses for each question. The favorable outcomes which were defined as responses of either scale of 4 or 5 were also summarized according to dental settings. The χ2 test for comparison was used to compare the favorable outcomes between the two settings. Findings – A total of 601 completed questionnaires were collected; 394 from university/hospital-based dental clinics and 207 from two private clinics and a special (after office hour) clinic of a faculty of dentistry. Overall, the majority of respondents in both university/hospital-based and private practice settings felt that it is important to have a dentist conduct a screening (84.8 vs 79.5 percent). The majority of patients in both groups were willing to receive blood pressure examination (95.0 vs 92.0 percent), weight and height measurements (94.7 vs 94.0 percent), saliva/oral fluid investigation (86.4 and 86.9 percent) and finger-stick blood test (83.8 vs 83.9 percent). More than 75 percent of all respondents agreed with diabetes screening in dental clinics. Originality/value – The majority of respondents supported the screening of DM in dental settings and they were willing to have a screening test by the dentist. Patient acceptance is an important key to be successful in the screening of DM in dental settings."
"The development of neonatal nursing standards of practice for Cambodia: A Delphi study  Manila Prak and Suvinee Wivatvanit.Purpose – Cambodia has one of the highest death rates for children under five years of age in Southeast Asia. The high mortality rate of children under five years of age, especially the neonate is 35 per 1,000 for the period zero to four years. There are no neonatal nursing standards of practice to guide nurses providing neonatal nursing care. Some general guidelines are currently being implemented for both doctors and nurses. The Minister for Health officially launched the Cambodian Council of Nurses’ Guideline for the Standard of Nursing Care in December 2015. In the absence of specific neonatal nursing standards of practice, the purpose of this paper is to develop the Neonatal Nursing Standard of Practice for Cambodia. Design/methodology/approach – The Delphi technique was selected as being appropriate for this study. The snowball with purposive sampling was used. The identified experts were located across Cambodia so the e-Delphi approach was considered appropriate and applicable according to the study context. Four experts preferred to be interviewed face-to-face, while 16 experts were confident to use e-mail to respond to the questionnaire in Round 1. In total, 19 experts provided responses via e-mail to the Rounds 2 and 3 questionnaires. Findings – A Standard for Neonatal Nursing Practice for Cambodia which consists of ten standards was found as a result of this study: assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, implementation, evaluation, ethics, evidence-based practice and research, health teaching and health promotion, continuing education, and communication. Originality/value – All items and sub-items achieved consensus as either being at the most significant level and therefore, could be key indicators for neonatal nursing standards of practice. The results of this study can be incorporated into a focused discussion led by the Nursing and Midwifery Bureau of the Ministry of Health to develop national standards of practice for neonatal nurses in Cambodia."

Originality/value – Knowledge and understanding gained from this paper might be useful in the efforts to develop and manage national health care systems to ensure a reasonable balance in health status of people of all groups."
"Assessment of the validity and reliability of an urban household health expenditure (HHE) questionnaire in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Murallitharan Munisamy, Tharini Thanapalan, Pattaraporn Piwong, Alessio Panza and Sathirakorn Pongpanich.Purpose – Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments continue to be a major method of financing healthcare in many low- and middle-income countries including Malaysia. Although macro-level data show that this is a substantial percentage of national health expenditure, at the grassroots level, the amount spent on health by households remains unknown in Malaysia. The purpose of this paper is to assess the validity and reliability of an adapted-for-purpose questionnaire designed to capture urban household health expenditures (HHEs) among Malaysian households. Design/methodology/approach – This two-part study assessed content validity of the questionnaire using three experts and the reliability of the questionnaire through a test-retest study among 50 OOP-paying patients followed up at one private primary care clinic in Kuala Lumpur. This study was approved by the Malaysian Research Ethics Committee (NMRR-16-172-29311-IIR). Findings – The validity of the 83-item questionnaire was high, with an item content validity index of 1.00 and a scale content validity index average score of 1.0 agreed to among the evaluating experts. In the test-retest reliability study, the majority of the categorical questionnaire items had perfect agreement values (k = 0.81-1.00). Continuous questionnaire items were also found to be highly reliable with no significant differences between the test-retest segments and high correlation coefficient values (intra-class correlation coefficient > 0.7). Originality/value – The HHE questionnaire had excellent content validity and very high test-retest reliability. The results of this study suggest that this questionnaire could be used in Malaysian studies to determine actual urban HHE which is a first step toward developing universal health coverage for all."
"Assessment of ambient dust pollution status at selected point sources (Residential and commercial) of Mingaladon area, Yangon region, Myanmar  Sai Nyanlin Tun, Than Htut Aung, Aye Sandar Mon, Pyay Hein Kyaw, Wattasit Siriwong, Mark Robson and Than Htut.Purpose – Dust (particulate matters) is very dangerous to our health as it is not visible with our naked eyes. Emissions of dust concentrations in the natural environment can occur mainly by road traffic, constructions and dust generating working environments. The purpose of this paper is to assess the ambient dust pollution status and to find out the association between PM concentrations and other determinant factors such as wind speed, ambient temperature, relative humidity and traffic congestion. Design/methodology/approach – A cross-sectional study was conducted for two consecutive months (June and July, 2016) at a residential site (Defence Services Liver Hospital, Mingaladon) and a commercial site (Htouk-kyant Junction, Mingaladon) based on WHO Air Quality Reference Guideline Value (24-hour average). Hourly monitoring of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration and determinant factors such as traffic congestion, wind speed, ambient temperature and relative humidity for 24 hours a day was performed in both study sites. CW-HAT200 handheld particulate matters monitoring device was used to assess PM concentrations, temperature and humidity while traffic congestion was monitored by CCTV cameras. Findings – The baseline PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations of Mingaladon area were (28.50 ± 11.49)µg/m3 and (52.69 ± 23.53)µg/m3, means 61.48 percent of PM2.5 concentration and 54.92 percent of PM10 concentration exceeded than the WHO reference value during the study period. PM concentration usually reached a peak during early morning (within 3:00 a.m.-5:00 a.m.) and at night (after 9:00 p.m.). PM2.5 concentration mainly depends on traffic congestion and temperature (adjusted R2 = 0.286), while PM10 concentration depends on traffic congestion and relative humidity (adjusted R2 = 0.292). Wind speed played a negative role in both PM2.5 and PM10 concentration with r = −0.228 and r = −0.266. Originality/value – The air quality of the study area did not reach the satisfiable condition. The main cause of increased dust pollution in the whole study area was high traffic congestion (R2 = 0.63 and 0.60 for PM2.5 and PM10 concentration)."
"Integrated genome-wide Alu methylation and transcriptome profiling analyses reveal novel epigenetic regulatory networks associated with autism spectrum disorder  2018 The Author(s).Background: Alu elements are a group of repetitive elements that can influence gene expression through CpG residues and transcription factor binding. Altered gene expression and methylation profiles have been reported in various tissues and cell lines from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the role of Alu elements in ASD remains unclear. We thus investigated whether Alu elements are associated with altered gene expression profiles in ASD. Methods: We obtained five blood-based gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and human Alu-inserted gene lists from the TranspoGene database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ASD were identified from each study and overlapped with the human Alu-inserted genes. The biological functions and networks of Alu-inserted DEGs were then predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). A combined bisulfite restriction analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 36 ASD and 20 sex- and age-matched unaffected individuals was performed to assess the global DNA methylation levels within Alu elements, and the Alu expression levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: In ASD blood or blood-derived cells, 320 Alu-inserted genes were reproducibly differentially expressed. Biological function and pathway analysis showed that these genes were significantly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological functions involved in ASD etiology. Interestingly, estrogen receptor and androgen signaling pathways implicated in the sex bias of ASD, as well as IL-6 signaling and neuroinflammation signaling pathways, were also highlighted. Alu methylation was not significantly different between the ASD and sex- and age-matched control groups. However, significantly altered Alu methylation patterns were observed in ASD cases sub-grouped based on Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised scores compared with matched controls. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Alu expression also showed significant differences between ASD subgroups. Interestingly, Alu expression was correlated with methylation status in one phenotypic ASD subgroup. Conclusion: Alu methylation and expression were altered in LCLs from ASD subgroups. Our findings highlight the association of Alu elements with gene dysregulation in ASD blood samples and warrant further investigation. Moreover, the classification of ASD individuals into subgroups based on phenotypes may be beneficial and could provide insights into the still unknown etiology and the underlying mechanisms of ASD."
"Insight into a conformation of the PNA-PNA duplex with (2″R,4″R)- and (2″R,4″S)-prolyl-(1S,2S)-2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid backbones  2018 Elsevier B.V.Suitable conformations for peptide nucleic acid (PNA) self-hybrids with (2′R,4′R)- and (2′R,4′S)-prolyl-(1S,2S)-2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid backbones (namely, acpcPNA and epi-acpcPNA, respectively) were investigated based on molecular dynamics simulations. The results revealed that hybridization of the acpcPNA was observed only in the parallel direction, with a conformation close to the P-type structure. In contrast, self-hybrids of the epi-acpcPNA were formed in the antiparallel and parallel directions; the antiparallel duplex adopted the B-form conformation, and the parallel duplex was between B- and P-forms. The calculated binding energies and the experimental data indicate that the antiparallel epi-acpcPNA self-hybrid was more stable than the parallel duplex."
"Sleep disorders and their management in children with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome referred to sleep clinics  2018 American Academy of Sleep Medicine. All rights reserved.Study Objectives: The nature of sleep disorders in children with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is unknown. We aimed to describe the type, the management, and the short-term outcome of sleep disorders in children with EDS referred to sleep clinics. Methods: This is a retrospective review of medical records and polysomnography tests of children with EDS younger than 18 years who were referred to the sleep clinic. Demographic information and medical history were collected, and polysomnography tests were reviewed. Questionnaires completed during previous clinic visits, including the Pediatrics Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), were also evaluated. Results: Sixty-five patients with EDS-hypermobility type were included. The mean age was 13.15 ± 3.9 years. There were 68% of patients who were female, and 91% of patients were Caucasian. The mean follow-up period was 1.14 ± 1.55 years. Common sleep diagnoses included insomnia (n = 14, 22%), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (n = 17, 26%), periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) (n = 11, 17%), and hypersomnia (n = 10, 15%). In addition, 65% required pharmacologic treatment and 29% were referred to behavioral sleep medicine. For OSA, two patients required continuous positive airway pressure. A significant improvement was observed in the PSQ, ESS, and PedsQL scores during follow-up visits after treatment (n = 34; P =.0004, 0.03, and 0.01, respectively). Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of sleep disorders, including OSA, insomnia, PLMD, and hypersomnia in children with EDS referred to sleep clinics. Specific management can improve quality of life and questionnaire scores of this patient population. Our study emphasizes the importance of screening for sleep disorders in children with EDS."
"Effects of bedroom environmental conditions on the severity of obstructive sleep apnea  2018 American Academy of Sleep Medicine. All rights reserved.Study Objectives: Epidemiological associations have demonstrated the effects of long-term air pollution to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) through a physiological mechanism linking particulate matter exposure to OSA. This study aimed to determine the relationship between bedroom environmental conditions, OSA severity, and sleep quality. Methods: Sixty-three participants were enrolled for an overnight polysomnography; OSA was diagnosed between May to August 2016. Personal characteristics and sleep quality were obtained by a face-to-face interview. Bedroom environments, including data on particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), temperature, and relative humidity, were collected by personal air sampling and a HOBO tempt/RH data logger. Results: Sixty-eight percent of the participants experienced poor sleep. An elevation in 1-year mean PM10 concentration was significantly associated with an increase in apnea-hypopnea index (beta = 1.04, P =.021) and respiratory disturbance index (beta = 1.07, P =.013). An increase of bedroom temperature during sleep was significantly associated with poorer sleep quality (adjusted odds ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.10, P =.044). Associations between PM10 concentration and respiratory disturbance index were observed in the dry season (beta = 0.59, P =.040) but not in the wet season (beta = 0.39, P =.215). PM10 was not associated with subjective sleep quality. Conclusions: Elevation of PM10 concentration is significantly associated with increased OSA severity. Our findings suggest that reduction in exposure to particulate matter and suitable bedroom environments may lessen the severity of OSA and promote good sleep."
"Performance of integrated ferrate–polyaluminum chloride coagulation as a treatment technology for removing freshwater humic substances  2018 Elsevier LtdFerrate-based technologies can play versatile roles in water treatment because of their potential for in situ production and because they do not form any harmful by-products. We compared the oxidative performance of Fe(VI) generated by an electrochemical process, with H2O2-UV irradiation (a standard oxidation process) for removing Suwannee River natural organic matter. It took only 5 min for Fe(VI) (Fe: 1.67 × 10−4 M) to reduce the fluorescence intensity of a humic-like fluorophore by 36% of the original value; in contrast, it took 120 min of irradiation using H2O2-UV ([OH[rad]] ∼ 1.8 × 10−13 M) to remove 68% of the original value. In addition to the short reaction time, ferrate can also form aggregates that can remove turbidity and adsorb organics and other contaminants present in water. Simultaneous addition of ferrate and polyaluminum chloride (PACl) to unfiltered natural water displayed the most efficient reduction of UVA254, primarily under acidic conditions. Ferrate pre-oxidation followed by PACl coagulation was the most effective process for reducing turbidity and chromaticity, because of the effects arising from the coagulation of ferrate that resulted in Fe(III)(s) species. Ferrate pre-oxidation generated low-molecular-weight UVA254-absorbing organics, whose dissolved organic matter (DOM) peak at 1250 Da was removed by PACl coagulation. Neither the initial pH nor the process order significantly affected the removal of organic carbon by the integrated ferrate-PACl process."
"One-pot method to synthesis polyaniline wrapped graphene aerogel/silver nanoparticle composites for solid-state supercapacitor devices  2018 Elsevier B.V.An efficient method for synthesis of polyaniline wrapped graphene aerogel/silver nanoparticles (PANi/rGA/AgNPs) has been successfully developed via a facile in situ one-pot hydrothermal method. The synergistic effect of the large surface area of rGA simultaneously with the high redox reaction of AgNPs and PANi, constituting a unique micro-nano framework structure, possesses the beneficial to rate capability and cycle stability. The assembled solid-state supercapacitors of PANi wrapped rGA/AgNPs can endow the specific capacitance of 365.14 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a high capacity retention of 88% after 4000 cycles at 1 A g−1."
"On the bisymmetric nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem  2017 Elsevier Inc.The problem of finding conditions for a list of n complex numbers to be the eigenvalues of an n×n nonnegative matrix is called the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP). The SNIEP (BNIEP) is the NIEP when the desired matrices are symmetric (bisymmetric). Recently, some sufficient conditions for the BNIEP are given by Julio and Soto in [6]. In this article, we study the BNIEP for n=4 and prove that the BNIEP and SNIEP are different for n=6. Then we give some sufficient conditions for the BNIEP and for the NIEP for normal centrosymmetric matrices related to the sufficient conditions of Julio and Soto and we also provide certain sufficient conditions for the BNIEP analogous to the sufficient conditions for the NIEP given by Borobia in [1]. Finally, we give sufficient conditions for the BNIEP when the prescribed diagonal entries are required."
"Pyrrolidinyl PNA polypyrrole/silver nanofoam electrode as a novel label-free electrochemical miRNA-21 biosensor  2017 Elsevier B.V.A label-free electrochemical miRNA biosensor was developed based on a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)/polypyrrole (PPy)/silver nanofoam (AgNF) modified electrode. The AgNF was electrodeposited as redox indicator on a gold electrode, which was then functionalized with an electropolymerized layer of PPy, a conducting polymer, to immobilize the PNA probes. The fabrication process was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The biosensor was used to detect miRNA-21, a biomarker abnormally expressed in most cancers. The signal was monitored by the change in current of the AgNF redox reaction before and after hybridization using cyclic voltammetry. Two PNA probe lengths were investigated and the longer probe exhibited a better performance. Nucleotide overhangs on the electrode side affected the signal more than overhangs on the solution side due to the greater insulation of the sensing surface. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical signal was proportional to miRNA-21 concentrations between 0.20 fM and 1.0 nM, with a very low detection limit of 0.20 fM. The biosensor showed a high specificity which could discriminate between complementary, single-, doubled-base mismatched, and non-complementary targets. Three out of the seven tested plasma samples provided detectable concentrations (63 ± 4, 111 ± 4 and 164 ± 7 fM). The sensor also showed good recoveries (81–119%). The results indicated the possibilities of this biosensor for analysis without RNA extraction and/or amplification, making the sensor potentially useful for both the prognosis and diagnosis of cancer in clinical application."
"Non-enzymatic electrochemical detection of glucose with a disposable paper-based sensor using a cobalt phthalocyanine–ionic liquid–graphene composite  2017 Elsevier B.V.We introduce for the first time a paper-based analytical device (PAD) for the non-enzymatic detection of glucose by modifying a screen-printed carbon electrode with cobalt phthalocyanine, graphene and an ionic liquid (CoPc/G/IL/SPCE). The modifying composite was characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The disposable devices show excellent conductivity and fast electron transfer kinetics. The results demonstrated that the modified electrode on PADs had excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose with NaOH as supporting electrolyte (0.1 M). The oxidation potential of glucose was negatively shifted to 0.64 V vs. the screen-printed carbon pseudo-reference electrode. The paper-based sensor comprised a wide linear concentration range for glucose, from 0.01 to 1.3 mM and 1.3–5.0 mM for low and high concentration of glucose assay, respectively, with a detection limit of 0.67 µM (S/N = 3). Additionally, the PADs were applied to quantify glucose in honey, white wine and human serum. The disposable, efficient, sensitive and low-cost non-enzymatic PAD has great potential for the development of point-of-care testing (POCT) devices that can be applied in healthcare monitoring."
"Development of an automated wax-printed paper-based lateral flow device for alpha-fetoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  2017In this study, a novel wax-printed paper-based lateral flow device has been developed as an alternative approach for an automated and one-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The design pattern consisted of a non-delayed channel, a wax-delayed channel, a test zone and a control zone. This system was easily fabricated on a nitrocellulose membrane using a wax-printing method and then baked in an oven at 100 °C for 1 min. The four barriers of the wax-delayed channel could delay the flow time for 11 s compared to the flow time of the non-delayed channel. To use the device under optimal conditions, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was detected at a limit of detection of 1 ng mL−1 and assessed with the naked eye within 10 min. A colorimetric intensity was also measured using a smart phone and computer software at a linear range of 0.1–100 ng mL−1 with a good correlation. Furthermore, the proposed device was successfully applied to detect AFP in human serum. Therefore, the wax-printing demonstrates a user-friendly, easy and quick method for the fabrication of the device, which could be used as a one-step, portable, disposable, low-cost, simple, instrument-free and point-of-care device for the automated ELISA."
"An unusual manifestation of calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome in kidney transplantation: A case report and literature review  Am J Case Rep, 2018.Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are the mainstay immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplantation. Although they provide excellent allograft and patient outcomes, adverse effects are frequently encountered. Calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome (CIPS) is a rare adverse effect of CNI. Previous case reports with CIPS diagnosis involved incapacitating pain in the lower extremities. Case Report: In this article, we report the first case of CIPS with severe back pain as the presenting symptom, which was correlated with a high tacrolimus trough concentration due to a drug interaction with clotrimazole troche. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed bone marrow edema, which is consistent with previous case reports. The patient’s symptoms resolved within 3 weeks of the onset of pain. Treatments were symptomatic care and lowering the tacrolimus trough concentration. Pain was improved significantly with pregabalin but not with nifedipine. Conclusions: We reviewed the literature of kidney transplant cohorts with CIPS to ascertain prevalence, pain characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Apart from our case, all patients experienced lower extremities pain and were pain-free during the follow-up period, without any residual abnormalities. CIPS is a benign but adverse effect of CNI. Counselling patients about the disease’s natural history and supportive care remain the best treatment."
"Influence of salt concentration on solubility and tie-line data for the system: Formic acid + n-butanol + water  2017 Taylor & Francis.The tie-line and solubility data, i.e. formic acid (FA) + n-butanol + water + NaCl, were resolved at T = 298.15 K and under ambient pressure. The Othmer–Tobias equation was applied in this study. The experimental data were correlated and all linear correlation coefficients were found to be approximately equal to 1. Both the Universal Quasi-chemical Theory (UNIQUAC) and Nonrandom Two Liquid Theory (NRTL) and NRTL models were employed in order to compare the experimental liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE) and tie-line data. Consequently, the calculated and experimental data proved to be a good fit. Results show that adding salt to the system proved beneficial by increasing the separation of FA from water."
"Evaluation of stability and viscosity measurement of emulsion from oil from production in northern oilfield in Thailand  2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Emulsion is normally present in oil due to the mixing occurring during oil recovery. The formation of emulsion can cause some problems in production and transportation. Viscosity and stability of emulsion play a key roles in oil transportation and separation to meet sales specification. Therefore, the aims of this research are to measure the viscosity of oil an emulsion and to evaluate the stability of emulsion of light oil from Fang oilfield in Thailand. The parameters of this study are temperature, shear rate and water cut ranging from 50 to 80 °C, 3.75 to 70 s-1 and 0 to 60%, respectively. These effects of parameters on viscosity and stability of emulsion are required for the design of the process and to increase oil production with various conditions. The results shows that viscosity decreases as temperature and shear rate increase. In contrast, viscosity becomes higher when water cut is lower. Furthermore, droplet sizes of water-in-oil emulsion at different conditions are investigated the stability of emulsion. The droplet sizes become smaller when high shear rate is applied and emulsion becomes more stable. Furthermore, correlations are developed to predict the viscosity and stability of the oil and emulsion from Thailand."
"Potential of carbon dioxide storage from petroleum industries in the Gulf of Thailand for green production  2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Recently, climate change and global warming are the global concern because of an increase in the huge amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This gas comes from energy activities and industries like petroleum industries. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the practical technology to reduce and storage CO2. In Thailand, one of the main potential sites for storage is the Gulf of Thailand. However, the research on this issue is very rare in Thailand. Consequently, this work is aiming on the potential study of CO2 geological storage in formations in the Gulf of Thailand by using simulation. The CO2 storage capacity, pressure buildup and plume migration have been estimated. Also, this study has been simulated with various conditions. CO2 injection is used from 1,000-4,000 tons per day with the depth from 2,200-2,330 meters and the results are studied for 50 years as a monitoring period. The results present that with the formation characteristics, CO2 storage in this area has potential. Moreover, pressure buildup and plume migration are illustrated for the period of 50 years. As a fundamental knowledge, this study can contribute to CO2 storage in an offshore area in Thailand."
"Physicians' and nurses' thoughts and concerns about introducing neonatal male circumcision in Thailand: A qualitative study  2018 The Author(s).Background: Neonatal male circumcision (NMC) is an alternative approach to adult male circumcision for HIV prevention. Recent studies found that NMC was rarely performed in Thailand and that most Thai health professionals did not recognize that NMC could reduce the risk of HIV infection and would not want NMC services in their hospitals. This study explored the thoughts and concerns of Thai government health staff regarding the introduction of NMC in government health facilities as a public health measure. Methods: In-depth interviews with physicians, nurses and physician administrators from four different levels of government hospitals in four provinces representing 4 regions of Thailand were conducted after provision of education regarding the benefits and risks of NMC. Interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using Atlas.ti software to develop themes. Results: Six themes emerged from the data of 42 respondents: understanding of the benefits of NMC; risks of NMC; need for a pilot project; need for staff training and hospital readiness; need for parental/family education; and need for public awareness educational campaign. Major concerns included possible medical complications of NMC, infringement of child rights, and lack of understanding from staff and parents. The respondents emphasized the need for a clear policy, proper training of staff, financial and equipment support, and piloting NMC rollout before this measure could be fully implemented. Conclusions: Thai health professionals who took part in this study expressed several concerns if NMC had to be performed in their health care facilities. There is significant preparation that needs to be done before NMC can be introduced in the country."
"Measurement of the associated production of a single top quark and a Z boson in pp collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The AuthorA measurement is presented of the associated production of a single top quark and a Z boson. The study uses data from proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV recorded by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Using final states with three leptons (electrons or muons), the tZq production cross section is measured to be σ(pp→tZq→Wbℓ+ℓ−q)=123−31 +33(stat)−23 +29(syst)fb, where ℓ stands for electrons, muons, or τ leptons, with observed and expected significances of 3.7 and 3.1 standard deviations, respectively."
"Observation of the Higgs boson decay to a pair of τ leptons with the CMS detector  2018 The Author(s)A measurement of the H→ττ signal strength is performed using events recorded in proton–proton collisions by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1. The H→ττ signal is established with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared to an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations. The best fit of the product of the observed H→ττ signal production cross section and branching fraction is 1.09−0.26 +0.27 times the standard model expectation. The combination with the corresponding measurement performed with data collected by the CMS experiment at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8TeV leads to an observed significance of 5.9 standard deviations, equal to the expected significance. This is the first observation of Higgs boson decays to τ leptons by a single experiment."
"Search for pair production of vector-like quarks in the bWb‾W channel from proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The Author(s)A search is presented for the production of vector-like quark pairs, TT‾ or YY‾ with electric charge of 2/3 (T) or −4/3 (Y), in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV. The data were collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.8fb−1. The T and Y quarks are assumed to decay exclusively to a W boson and a b quark. The search is based on events with a single isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets with large transverse momenta. In the search, a kinematic reconstruction of the final state observables is performed, which would permit a signal to be detected as a narrow mass peak (≈7% resolution). The observed number of events is consistent with the standard model prediction. Assuming strong pair production of the vector-like quarks and a 100% branching fraction to bW, a lower limit of 1295 GeV at 95% confidence level is set on the T and Y quark masses."
"Briquette fuel production from wastewater sludge of beer industry and biodiesel production wastes  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The production of industrial wastes is increasing each year. Current methods of waste disposal are severely impacting the environment. Utilization of industrial wastes as an alternative material for fuel is gaining interest due to its environmental friendliness.

The appropriate ratio of brewery wastewater sludge and bleaching earth by weight was 95:5. This condition provided the highest heating value of approximately 3548.10 kcal/kg."
"Effectiveness of school- and family-based interventions to prevent gaming addiction among grades 4-5 students in Bangkok, Thailand  2018 Apisitwasana et al.Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Participatory Learning School and Family Based Intervention Program for Preventing Game Addiction by Developing Self- Regulation of gaming addiction among students of grades 4 and 5 in Bangkok. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was implemented among students of grades 4 and 5 at primary schools in Bangkok selected through multistage random sampling. Two comparable schools were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Then, 310 students in the randomly selected classrooms were allocated to each group. The intervention group received the self-regulation program with school and family involvement to prevent gaming addiction. Master teachers attended in-house training on prevention of gaming addiction in children. Parents of these children received a gaming addiction prevention manual and guidelines. The program lasted 8 weeks. The control group received no intervention. Knowledge and Attitude About Gaming Questionnaire, Game Addiction Screening Test (GAST), and Game Addiction Protection Scale were utilized to assess subjects at baseline, immediately after, and 3 months post-intervention. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, and independent t-test were used to describe characteristics of the participants, and repeated measures ANOVA was analyzed to test the effectiveness of the intervention. Results: The findings revealed that there were significant differences in knowledge, attitude, self-regulation, and gaming addiction behaviors (p < 0.05) immediately and 3 months postintervention. Positive effects of the intervention included increase in knowledge, attitude, and self-regulation, whereas the GAST score was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) immediately and 3 months after the program. Conclusion: The program based on self-regulation and school and family participation is effective for preventing gaming addiction in students of grades 4 and 5 in Bangkok, Thailand."
"Presenting Safety Topics Using a Graphic Novel, Manga, to Effectively Teach Chemical Safety to Students in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand  2018 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc..Manga are graphic novels that are considered to have the potential to effectively convey concepts and engage readers. The efficacy of manga has been validated for chemical safety education to students in three universities in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. Students were asked to examine a photo to identify hazards and hazardous behaviors that can potentially lead to accidents before and after reading a manga that explains the risk of fires and explosions. The identified hazards/hazardous behaviors were classified into seven categories, and the average number of hazards/hazardous behaviors was determined in each category. The differences before and after the lesson were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of manga as an educational tool. In the students' answers, in all three of the universities, some common features were observed: Subjects easily identified certain hazardous conditions in the photo, particularly noting deficient or unsuitable personal protective equipment. The hazards/hazardous behaviors that can potentially result in ignitions, fires, and explosions were more likely to be identified after the lesson. Many students found the manga a helpful tool for learning chemical safety."
"Search for supersymmetry with Higgs boson to diphoton decays using the razor variables at s=13TeV  2018 The Author(s)An inclusive search for anomalous Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel and in association with at least one jet is presented, using LHC proton–proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1. The razor variables MR and R2, as well as the momentum and mass resolution of the diphoton system, are used to categorize events into different search regions. The search result is interpreted in the context of strong and electroweak production of supersymmetric particles. We exclude bottom squark pair-production with masses below 450 GeV for bottom squarks decaying to a bottom quark, a Higgs boson, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) for LSP masses below 250 GeV. For wino-like chargino–neutralino production, we exclude charginos with mass below 170 GeV for LSP masses below 25 GeV. In the GMSB scenario, we exclude charginos with mass below 205 GeV for neutralinos decaying to a Higgs boson and a goldstino LSP with 100% branching fraction."
"Notch signaling in macrophages in the context of cancer immunity  2018 Palaga, Wongchana and Kueanjinda.Macrophages play both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting roles depending on the microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are often associated with poor prognosis in most, but not all cancer. Understanding how macrophages become TAMs and how TAMs interact with tumor cells and shape the outcome of cancer is one of the key areas of interest in cancer therapy research. Notch signaling is involved in macrophage activation and its effector functions. Notch signaling has been indicated to play roles in the regulation of macrophage activation in pro-inflammatory and wound-healing processes. Recent evidence points to the involvement of canonical Notch signaling in the differentiation of TAMs in a breast cancer model. On the other hand, hyperactivation of Notch signaling specifically in macrophages in tumors mass has been shown to suppress tumor growth in an animal model of cancer. Investigations into how Notch signaling is regulated in TAMs and translates into pro- or anti-tumor functions are still largely in their infancy. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the current understanding of the conflicting roles of Notch signaling in regulating the effector function of macrophages and the involvement of Notch signaling in TAM differentiation and function. Furthermore, how Notch signaling in TAMs affects the tumor microenvironment is reviewed. Finally, the direct or indirect cross-talk among TAMs, tumor cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment via Notch signaling is discussed along with the possibility of its clinical application. Investigations into Notch signaling in macrophages may lead to a more effective way for immune intervention in the treatment of cancer in the future."
"Avicequinone B sensitizes anoikis in human lung cancer cells  2018 The Author(s).Background: During metastasis, cancer cells require anokis resistant mechanism to survive until reach the distant secondary tissues. As anoikis sensitization may benefit for cancer therapy, this study demonstrated the potential of avicequinone B, a natural furanonaphthoquinone found in mangrove tree (Avicenniaceae) to sensitize anoikis in human lung cancer cells. Methods: Anoikis inducing effect was investigated in human lung cancer H460, H292 and H23 cells that were cultured in ultra-low attachment plate with non-cytotoxic concentrations of avicequinone B. Viability of detached cells was evaluated by XTT assay at 0-24 h of incubation time. Soft agar assay was performed to investigate the inhibitory effect of avicequinone B on anchorage-independent growth. The alteration of anoikis regulating molecules including survival and apoptosis proteins were elucidated by western blot analysis. Results: Avicequinone B at 4 μM significantly induced anoikis and inhibited proliferation under detachment condition in various human lung cancer cells. The reduction of anti-apoptotic proteins including anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) associating with the diminution of integrin/focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src) signals were detected in avicequinone B-treated cells. Conclusions: Avicequinone B sensitized anoikis in human lung cancer cells through down-regulation of anti-apoptosis proteins and integrin-mediated survival signaling."
"An exploratory study on the knowledge management process, tools, and technologies in the context of small restaurant businesses in Thailand  2018 IEEE.In Thailand, entrepreneurs can easily open a restaurant, although they often lack the necessary business management knowledge and experience, resulting in failure. As a consequence of the current situation and existing problems, restaurant business entrepreneurs require appropriate and specific knowledge management (KM). There are many existing research studies on KM, but these are not appropriate in the context of small restaurant business entrepreneurs. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are 1) to describe the current situation of the KM process in general; and 2) to study the current KM tools and technologies available to small restaurant entrepreneurs in Thailand. This study uses the qualitative approach by conducting in-depth interviews with nine small business entrepreneurs well-diversified by demographics in terms of age, and number of years' experience in the restaurant business. The researchers have chosen content analysis to analyse the interview transcripts. The results from the exploratory study indicate some interesting findings as evidenced by four main KM processes. The results also show that entrepreneurs of small restaurants lack the appropriate KM tools and technologies for each KM activity. Moreover, the appropriate use of offline and online KM tools can be essential for facilitating KM."
"Chemical constituents of the lichen Usnea baileyi (Stirt.) Zahlbr  2018 Elsevier LtdInvestigation of the chemical constituents of the lichen Usnea baileyi (Stirt.) Zahlbr led to the isolation of a new dimeric xanthone, bailexanthone (1), and a novel depsidone, bailesidone (2), along with twenty-five known metabolites (3–27). Their structures were established by means of extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison with data reported in the literatures. Compound 1 derives from secalonic acid scaffold with C-8/8′ reduction and compound 2 represents the first example of menegazziaic acid derivative with an unprecedented B-ring moiety.

All of them showed weak or no activity against two cell lines."
"Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) Seed Peptide Hydrolysate on RAW 264.7 Macrophage Cells  2018,  2018 Taylor & Francis.Lychee (Litchi chinensis) seeds, a by-product from the canned lychee processing, were hydrolyzed using various concentrations of proteases (Alcalase, Flavourzyme, and Neutrase). The protein hydrolysate produced with Neutrase at a concentration of 50 mg/mL exhibited the highest free radical scavenging activity. After ultrafiltration, the fraction containing peptides of less than 650 Da was purified by using gel filtration chromatography into G1–G3. The G1 fraction exhibited the highest activity and was further purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Four fractions (H1–H4) were isolated and exhibited efficient nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activity. The G1 fraction inhibited NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 cells with down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The results showed that lychee seed peptide hydrolysates exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activities, suggesting the peptides may be useful as additives to health products such as functional foods and/or pharmaceuticals."
"Measurement of the Splitting Function in pp and Pb-Pb Collisions at sNN =5.02 TeV  2018 CERN.Data from heavy ion collisions suggest that the evolution of a parton shower is modified by interactions with the color charges in the dense partonic medium created in these collisions, but it is not known where in the shower evolution the modifications occur. The momentum ratio of the two leading partons, resolved as subjets, provides information about the parton shower evolution. This substructure observable, known as the splitting function, reflects the process of a parton splitting into two other partons and has been measured for jets with transverse momentum between 140 and 500 GeV, in pp and PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair. In central PbPb collisions, the splitting function indicates a more unbalanced momentum ratio, compared to peripheral PbPb and pp collisions.. The measurements are compared to various predictions from event generators and analytical calculations."
"Nongenomic action of aldosterone on colocalization of angiotensin II type 1 and type 2 receptors in rat kidney  2018 National Society for Histotechnology.Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R) are co-localized and can form AT1R/AT2R dimerization in rat proximal tubular cells. Aldosterone non-genomically enhances angiotensin II receptor dimerization. We found no other in vivo studies in the literature regarding the effect of aldosterone on colocalization of AT1R and AT2R in whole kidney. Male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with either normal saline solution (sham group) or aldosterone (experimental group). Colocalization of renal AT1R and AT2R proteins was examined by double immunohistochemical staining. The colocalization of AT1R and AT2R proteins was more prominent in the glomerulus, distal convoluted tubules, and cortical collecting ducts while colocalization was weak and diffused in the proximal convoluted tubules and peritubular capillaries in both groups. Our in vivo study showed aldosterone did not alter a constitutive colocalization of AT1R and AT2R proteins in the renal cortex and medulla. However, these proteins were colocalized more prominently in the renal cortex."
"User Test on Text-Based CAPTCHA: A Letter Case Examination  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) is a security application requiring a user to input a string of text to verify that the user is human. Each text string has distinctive visual features, making it perceivably different from others. No empirical work has examined which text strings included in text-based CAPTCHA have high correct response rates from users. The current study hopes to fill this gap. A user test on 8,928 iterations for which both uppercase and lowercase letters were used in 1,844 CAPTCHA tests confirmed (a) users' correct response rates to lowercases were higher than those to the uppercases, although both rates are acceptable, (b) the letters with straight line features had higher correct response rates than those without these features, and (c) the diagonal or the slender features had no impact on the correct response rate. The findings offer both theoretical and practical contributions."
"Efficacy of dietary chitosan on growth performance, haematological parameters and gut function in broilers  2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Percentages of antimicrobial resistance to Salmonella and Escherichia coli in poultry products were high in Thailand, thus, alternative to antibiotic growth promoter is required. The objective of this experiment aimed to examine the effect of dietary chitosan in broilers on blood and intestinal changes. Total of 392, day-old male Ross 308 broilers were allotted into four groups. Broilers in the control group (group 1) received commercial corn-soybean meal-based basal diet. Chicks in group 2 received basal diet supplemented with 200 ppm amoxicillin. Chitosan was added into the basal diet at 1 and 2 g/kg in groups 3 and 4, respectively. Data on growth performance as well as blood and digesta samples were collected on d 21 and 39. The results showed that 2 g/kg dietary chitosan significantly improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) during d 22-39 and 1-39 (p <.05). This level of chitosan also increased the ratio of villus height (VH) and crypt depth (CD) (p <.05) while decreased the CD (p <.05). The supplementation of 1 and 2 g/kg chitosan in diet tended to reduce the ammonia-nitrogen in colonic digesta. Furthermore, both levels of chitosan enhanced number of Bacillus spp. while decreased number of E. coli (p <.001) leading to increased ratio of Lactobacillus and E. coli (p <.001). There were no significant effects on the heterophil (H): lymphocyte (L) ratio and coefficient of apparent ileal digestibility. In conclusion, the supplementation of 2 g/kg chitosan in broiler diets could be used as an alternative additive to antibiotic with its improvement on gut function."
"Low-cost and disposable sensors for the simultaneous determination of coenzyme Q10 and α-lipoic acid using manganese (IV) oxide-modified screen-printed graphene electrodes  2017 Elsevier B.V.In this work, for the first time, manganese (IV) oxide-modified screen-printed graphene electrodes (MnO2/SPGEs) were developed for the simultaneous electrochemical detection of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and α-lipoic acid (ALA). This sensor exhibits attractive benefits such as simplicity, low production costs, and disposability. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to characterize the electrochemical behavior of the analyte and investigate the capacitance and electroactive surface area of the unmodified and modified electrode surfaces. The electrochemical behavior of CoQ10 and ALA on MnO2/SPGEs was also discussed. Additionally, square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) was used for the quantitative determination of CoQ10 and ALA. Under optimal conditions, the obtained signals are linear in the concentration range from 2.0 to 75.0 μg mL−1 for CoQ10 and 0.3–25.0 μg mL−1 for ALA. The low limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 0.56 μg mL−1 and 0.088 μg mL−1 for CoQ10 and ALA, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated the utility and applicability of the MnO2/SPGE sensor through simultaneous measurements of CoQ10 and ALA in dietary supplements. The sensor provides high accuracy measurements, exhibiting its high potential for practical applications."

The AMP and DETA concentrations were varied (1–2.5 kmol/m3 and 0.5–2 kmol/m3, respectively) while the total amine concentration was constant at 3 kmol/m3. The absorption experiment was conducted at 15 %v/v CO2 and 313 K while the desorption temperature was at 363 K. Experimental results revealed that the absorption rates, cyclic capacities and desorption rates of some AMP–DETA blends were higher than those of 5 kmol/m3 MEA. The absorption heat of the blends is comparable to that of MEA while the heat duty of some AMP–DETA blends are much lower than that of 5 kmol/m3 MEA. The optimal amine blend was confirmed to be 2 kmol/m3 AMP – 1 kmol/m3 DETA. A model similar to the power law kinetic model showed that CO2 composition in the feed gas affected the initial absorption rates as compared to AMP/DETA molar concentration ratio. The model predicted the initial absorption rate with a %AAD of 0.52%. These results provide good prospects for AMP–DETA blends towards CO2 capture."
"A Mirroring Process: From School Management Team Cooperation to Teacher Collaboration  2018 Taylor & Francis.In this study, we examine how cooperation and constructive controversy evidenced within school management teams (SMT) relate to collaboration among teachers. Dyad survey data was collected from SMT members and teachers at 32 primary schools in Hong Kong. Results of multilevel regression analysis indicated that cooperation among SMT members was positively related to teacher collaboration. Moreover, constructive controversy within SMTs mediated the path and contributed additional variance explained in school-wide teacher collaboration. These findings affirm that the leadership dynamics of SMTs in Hong Kong primary schools do appear to have a positive influence on potentially important school-level conditions."
"Impact of rest-break interventions on the neck and shoulder posture of symptomatic VDU operators during prolonged computer work  2017 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).There is limited research on the effects of different types of rest-break interventions for visual display unit (VDU) operators on neck and shoulder postures. This study examined the effect of rest-break interventions on the neck and shoulder postures of symptomatic VDU operators during prolonged computer work. Thirty subjects were randomly and equally assigned to breaks with stretching, breaks with dynamic movement and passive breaks. Subjects performed the typing task for 60 min and received 3-min breaks after 20 min of work. The craniovertebral and forward shoulder angles were obtained from a 3D motion analysis system. Results showed that there were no significant differences in the craniovertebral and forward shoulder angles among any types of rest breaks. It can be concluded that the three types of rest-break interventions had positive effects on neck and shoulder posture during prolonged computer terminal work."
"Body image dissatisfaction in pregnant and non-pregnant females is strongly predicted by immune activation and mucosa-derived activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway  2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Objectives: The aim of the present study is to delineate the associations between body image dissatisfaction in pregnant women and immune-inflammatory biomarkers, i.e., C-reactive protein (CRP), zinc and IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan and tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). Methods: We assessed 49 pregnant and 24 non-pregnant females and assessed Body Image Satisfaction (BIS) scores at the end of term (T1), and 2–4 days (T2) and 4–6 weeks (T3) after delivery. Subjects were divided in those with a lowered BIS score (≤ 3) versus those with a higher score. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that a lowered T1 BIS score was predicted by CRP levels and IgA responses to tryptophan (negative) and TRYCATs (positive), perinatal depression, body mass index (BMI) and age. The sum of quinolinic acid, kynurenine, 3-OH-kynurenine and 3-OH-anthranilic acid (reflecting brain quinolinic acid contents) was the single best predictor. In addition, a large part of the variance in the T1, T2 and T3 BIS scores was explained by IgA responses to tryptophan and TRYCATs, especially quinolinic acid. Conclusions: Body image dissatisfaction is strongly associated with inflammation and mucosa-derived IDO activation independently from depression, pregnancy, BMI and age. IgA responses to peripheral TRYCATs, which determine brain quinolinic acid concentrations, also predict body image dissatisfaction."
"A teacher's perspective on autonomy and self-access: from theory to perception to practice  2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Considerable resources are expended on the development of learner autonomy (LA), and in particular on the provision of self-access facilities as one of the most common ways in which institutions have tried to foster autonomy. Whether the intended outcomes are achieved depends in large part on teachers’ agreement with and understanding of the rationale behind these efforts. A mismatch between an institutional objective and a classroom implementation may, for example, negatively impact the student experience. This project looks at teachers’ perspectives on LA and self-access language learning in a university setting where a self-access component was introduced as a compulsory element of students’ first-year courses. How do teachers conceptualise autonomous learning, what importance do they assign to it, and how do they attempt to foster autonomy in practice? What role do they see for self-access learning in this? In this project, we used a mixed-methods approach and obtained questionnaire data from 47 teachers on an English as a Foreign Language programme at a university in Thailand, as well as qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 5 teachers, on their beliefs about autonomy and self-access. The results show a complex interplay between teachers’ beliefs, institutional constraints, and classroom implementation."

"Suppression of Excited States Relative to the Ground State in Pb-Pb Collisions at s NN=5.02 TeV  2018 CERN.The relative yields of mesons produced in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV and reconstructed via the dimuon decay channel are measured using data collected by the CMS experiment. Double ratios are formed by comparing the yields of the excited states, (2S) and (3S), to the ground state, (1S), in both Pb-Pb and pp collisions at the same center-of-mass energy. The double ratios, [(nS)/(1S)]Pb-Pb/[(nS)/(1S)]pp, are measured to be 0.308±0.055(stat)±0.019(syst) for the (2S) and less than 0.26 at 95% confidence level for the (3S). No significant (3S) signal is found in the Pb-Pb data. The double ratios are studied as a function of collision centrality, as well as transverse momentum and rapidity. No significant dependencies are observed."
"Why should neuroscientists worry about iron? The emerging role of ferroptosis in the pathophysiology of neuroprogressive diseases  2017 Elsevier B.V.Ferroptosis is a unique form of programmed death, characterised by cytosolic accumulation of iron, lipid hydroperoxides and their metabolites, and effected by the fatal peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane. It is a major driver of cell death in neurodegenerative neurological diseases. Moreover, cascades underpinning ferroptosis could be active drivers of neuropathology in major psychiatric disorders. Oxidative and nitrosative stress can adversely affect mechanisms and proteins governing cellular iron homeostasis, such as the iron regulatory protein/iron response element system, and can ultimately be a source of abnormally high levels of iron and a source of lethal levels of lipid membrane peroxidation. Furthermore, neuroinflammation leads to the upregulation of divalent metal transporter1 on the surface of astrocytes, microglia and neurones, making them highly sensitive to iron overload in the presence of high levels of non-transferrin-bound iron, thereby affording such levels a dominant role in respect of the induction of iron-mediated neuropathology. Mechanisms governing systemic and cellular iron homeostasis, and the related roles of ferritin and mitochondria are detailed, as are mechanisms explaining the negative regulation of ferroptosis by glutathione, glutathione peroxidase 4, the cysteine/glutamate antiporter system, heat shock protein 27 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. The potential role of DJ-1 inactivation in the precipitation of ferroptosis and the assessment of lipid peroxidation are described. Finally, a rational approach to therapy is considered, with a discussion on the roles of coenzyme Q10, iron chelation therapy, in the form of deferiprone, deferoxamine (desferrioxamine) and deferasirox, and N-acetylcysteine."
"Orthodeoxia as a presentation of intravascular large B cell lymphoma  2018 The Authors.Intravascular large B cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare and aggressive sub-type of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, of which clinical presentations are highly variable among geographical areas. A case series of IVLBCL patients from Asian countries reported the disease to be more aggressive and associated with hemophagocytic syndrome than in cases from Western countries. Although published articles recently revealed hypoxemia as a presentation in IVLBCL patients, orthodeoxia has never been documented. A 71-year-old man presented with prolonged fever, cough, exertional dyspnoea, and orthodeoxia, later developing hypoxemic respiratory failure and refractory septic shock. Eventually, IVLBCL was diagnosed by random skin biopsy and bone marrow biopsy because of a high index of suspicion. We demonstrated the first case of orthodeoxia as an initial presentation of IVLBCL, clinically compatible with Asian-variant IVLBCL, which is commonly fatal and diagnostically challenging."

"Morphological and genetic characterization of marine filamentous cyanobacterium Geitlerinema isolated from Thailand  2018 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage. All Rights Reserved.Geitlerinema is a dominant benthic filamentous cyanobacterium found in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. We investigate the diversity of Geitlerinema strains isolated from Thailand using morphological and molecular characterization. No morphological differences were observed in the Geitlerinema isolates. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rDNA, the 16S–23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (16S–23S ITS) and the cpcB-cpcA intergenic spacer (cpcB-cpcA IGS) showed that the marine Geitlerinema isolates belong to a single cluster that includes marine Geitlerinema sp. Flo1 and Geitlerinema sp. PCC7105 but is distinct from a type species, Geitlerinema splendidum and Geitlerinema strains which were recently transferred to the genus Anagnostidinema. From our results, it is confirmed that marine Geitlerinema differs from true freshwater Geitlerinema and is proposed to be a new genus in Oscillatoriales. In addition, using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), the marine Geitlerinema isolates in this study could be classified into eight clades; however, this classification revealed no correlation with the geographic locations."
"Probiotics in human mental health and diseases-A minireview  2019 The authors.In humans, cognitive functions are controlled by the central nervous system, which is controlled by the brain. Any damage to the neuronal system causes serious impairment to the host as it may lead to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, autism and epilepsy. The physical and mental health of an individual is associated with food habits and brain health. The hypothalamus is the region of the brain that initiates a response to different types of stress. However, recent findings have revealed that food play a major role in regulating stress and mental health. In this regard, probiotics are beneficial microbes that are claimed to offer health benefits when consumed in adequate quantities. Probiotics alter the gut microbial composition in a positive way. Several in vitro, in vivo and pre-clinical studies have been conducted to determine the effects of probiotics or probiotic based food supplementation on the cognitive function of model system and human volunteers. Most of the studies suggest that the consumption of probiotic formulations improves cognitive function, stress management, and decision-making. This paper reviews recent findings regarding the influence of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function, especially in human subjects. The role of probiotics in maintaining healthy gut microbiota and detailed outcomes of clinical trials are here reported for easy understanding of the concept. However, more studies involving clinical trials are still required in the field of probiotics and cognitive function."
"Genistein-attenuated hepatic steatosis and inflammation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with bilateral ovariectomized rats  2018 Pharmacognosy Magazine. Published by Wolters Kluwer.Objective: The objective was to investigate the anti-lipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects of genistein on rats with estrogen deficiency and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Materials and Methods: Sprague-Dawley female rats (n = 48) were randomly divided into ovariectomized (OVX) and non-OVX groups, then again divided into three subgroups as follows: Controls, rats fed with high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) diet (NASH group), and rats fed with HFHF diet plus daily 16 mg/kg genistein (genistein group). Liver tissues were used for histology, liver tissues were used for histology and measured of hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) by colorimeter, and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) expression by immunohistochemistry. Serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: NASH group had increased serum TNF-α (171.62 ± 22.34 vs. 58.47 ± 14.83 pg/mL), %NFκB-positive cells (53.94 ± 11.89 vs. 13.73 ± 3.40), and hepatic FFA (9.07 ± 2.27 vs. 3.62 ± 0.77 nmol/mg tissue) when compared with control (P < 0.01). The most severe hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation was found in OVX with NASH group. Genistein treatment decreased serum TNF-α compared with NASH groups in both non-OVX and OVX groups (105.84 ± 29.77 vs. 171.62 ± 22.34 pg/mL and 73.07 ± 19.31 vs. 124.12 ± 16.04 pg/mL, respectively) (P < 0.01). Genistein reduced %NFκB-positive cells in NASH rats (31.84 ± 10.60 vs. 53.94 ± 11.89) and decreased hepatic FFA levels in OVX with NASH rats (6.50 ± 0.60 vs. 13.11 ± 1.65 nmol/mg tissue) when compared with NASH group, respectively (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Estrogen deficiency is the contributing factor that worsens NASH. Genistein attenuated hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation. Moreover, genistein demonstrated to be more effective in estrogen deficiency with NASH than ovary-intact rats."
"Combining accelerometry-based motion artifact cancellation with pulse oximetry processing  2018, Paulus Editora. All rights reserved.This paper proposes a combination of motion artifact (MA) cancellation with pulse oximetry processing. The objectives were to develop motion-resistant pulse oximetry processing relying on using accelerometry-based MA cancellation, and to explore the performance of the proposed processing method in providing arterial oxygen saturation (%SpO2) when the red and infrared (IR) photoplethysmogram (PPG) were corrupted by a MA. A PPG acquisition system was designed and constructed in the laboratory for the experiments. A three-axis accelerometer was utilized to detect the motion of a finger probe. An acceleration signal corresponding to the longitudinal direction of the finger was used to generate a motion reference signal for active noise cancellation using an adaptive filter. A Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to obtain the normalized first derivative of red and IR PPGs, and to generate a motion reference signal. The MA was eliminated from the normalized first derivative of red and IR PPGs using an adaptive filter, of which the adaptive algorithm was a recursive least square (RLS) method. The appropriate filter order was 16. After the MA cancellation, the normalized first derivative of the red and IR PPGs were expected to be free of MA, and they represented the arterial light absorption. The ratio of red to IR absorption (ra) was computed and converted to the %SpO2 using the saturation equation obtained from the calibration. The experimental results showed that the theoretical concept for combining the accelerometry-based MA cancellation with the pulse oximetry processing was practical. The proposed processing method helped reduce the error of the %SpO2 measurement when a MA was present, and it had more resistance to MA than conventional pulse oximetry processing."
"Buffalo and various ruminant embryos production by inter-species, inter-genus and inter-subfamily somatic cell nuclear transfer  2018, International Buffalo Information Center, Kasetsart University. All rights reserved.We have compared the effect of different nuclear-cytoplasmic relatedness on inter-species, somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) efficiency among buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), bovine (Bos taurus), goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) and gaur (Bos gaurus). on the in vitro embryo development. ISCNT is one of the techniques for species with limited availability oocytes and for endangered species. Ear fibroblast cells from buffalo, bovine and gaur were used as donor cells and recipient oocytes were obtained from buffalo, bovine and goat. The somatic cell nuclear transfer reconstructed embryos of various combinations were cultured. Our study showed that gaur-bovine (inter-species) blastocyst rate (12.10%) was higher than gaur-buffalo (intergenus) (5.10%) and gaur-goat (inter-subfamily) (3.21%). The inter-species SCNT (gaur-bovine) blastocyst rate (12.10%) was similar to those by inter-genus SCNT (buffalo-bovine, 12.24%). The gaur-goat (inter-subfamily) showed the lowest blastocyst rate (3.21%). And buffalo media culture condition could support the development of gaur, goat and bovine iSCNT embryos. In conclusion, our study showed that blastocysts were possibly produced by inter-species, inter-genus and inter-subfamily somatic cell nuclear transfer. The inter-species SCNT and inter-genus SCNT tend to show higher development efficiency than inter-subfamily SCNT."
"Evaluation of the first radiolabeled99mTc-Jerusalem artichoke-containing snack bar on gastric emptying and satiety in healthy female volunteers  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Jerusalem artichoke [JA] is a rich source of dietary fiber. Previous reports showed that JA influence delayed gastric emptying by prolonging gastric emptying, resulting in extending satiety. This property may be beneficial for current lifestyle of the working women who need simple and convenient form of energy supply but provide the effect of weight controlling at the same time. Objective: The present study aimed to label JA with 99mTc-pertechnetate and to evaluate the effect of JA formulation in a snack bar (JASB) on gastric emptying and satiety in healthy female subjects. Materials and Methods: JASB and control snack bar [CSB] were prepared by mixing JA syrup with SnCl2 0.1 mg for 15 minutes, and subsequently adding 99mTc-pertechnetate 1 mCi. The incubation time was 10 minutes at room temperature. The labeled 99mTc-JASB mixture were then put in a rectangular mold and baked in an oven at 180°C for 20 minutes. A randomized double-blinded crossover design study was conducted to evaluate the gastric emptying process in vivo. Thirty healthy female participants whose average age was 29.1±1.95 year were recruited for this study. The participants were instructed to consume JASB and then to stand in an upright position. For gastric emptying analysis, scintigraphic method was used. Sequential data acquisition was performed in upright 45 degree left anterior oblique (45° LAO) position for 4 hours. Participants were also asked to describe their satiety by making a vertical mark on 100-mm visual analogue scales [VAS] during data acquisition. This procedure was repeated for each subject but after consuming CSB. Results: The 99mTc-Jerusalem artichoke was successfully labeled with radiochemical purity of more than 90%. The gastric emptying half time and percent gastric of JASB were significantly greater than CSB (p<0.05). The satiety at these intervals were also notably distinctive (p<0.05) between JASB and CSB. In JASB studies, the gastric emptying exhibited a strong positive correlation with satiety (R2 = 0.89, p<0.05). Conclusion: JA plays a key part in delaying gastric emptying of consumed snack bar, resulting in prolonged subjects’ satiety."
"Comprehensive evaluation of fecal incontinence: A preliminary report of anatomical neurophysiologic study  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Fecal incontinence [FI] can lead to impaired quality of life and the prevalence is under-reported. The etiology is multifactorial. Careful clinical and neurophysiologic test is used to demonstrate the underlying problem. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate the systematic assessment of the subjects with FI and to compare the investigation findings of the FI group with healthy volunteers. Materials and Methods: Forty-three subjects with FI and 46 healthy volunteers were evaluated by history taking, physical examination, anorectal manometry, endoanal ultrasound and selective use of pudendal nerve terminal motor latency test [PNTML], The results were compared. Results: By anorectal manometry, subjects with FI had significantly shorter high-pressure zone (1.7 vs. 2.3 cm), lower resting anal sphincter pressure (35.2 vs. 64.3 mmHg), lower maximal squeeze pressure (95.7 vs. 203.5 mmHg) and sustained squeeze pressure (74.3 vs. 121.3 mmHg) (p<0.001). Rectal hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity were found in 61% and 23% of the subjects, respectively. Rectoanal inhibitory reflex was absent in 7% and impaired in 23% of subjects. Cough reflex was impaired in 21%. Saline continence test was abnormal in 77% of FI subjects. By endoanal ultrasound, anal sphincter defect or scar was found in 86% of the FI subjects. Anal canal length was found to be significantly shorter in subjects with FI both in the anterior (12.4 vs. 30.4 mm) and posterior (20.1 vs. 35.9 mm) position (p<0.001). In 10 FI subjects that PNTML was performed, 6 subjects demonstrated either unilateral (3) or bilateral (3) pudendal neuropathy. Significant correlation between FISI and posterior anal canal length was observed (r = 0.512, p = 0.015). Conclusion: Various information of anorectal function and anatomy in subjects with FI can be obtained by systematic approach. This information may be useful for the management planning and patient education."
"Multi-detector computed tomography versus endoscopic ultrasonography for the detection of pancreatic cancer  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: Endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS] has been claimed to be superior to computed tomography in detecting pancreatic cancer. However, there have been only few studies comparing multi-detector computed tomography [MDCT] with EUS. This study aims to compare the detection rate of EUS with that of MDCT for pancreatic cancer. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study took place in January 2009 to January 2014 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Patients who underwent both EUS and MDCT for suspected or known pancreatic cancer were included. Patients with insufficient data, cystic pancreatic lesion, benign masses and/or other malignant masses were excluded. Only patients with pathologically proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were included for analysis. The detection rates of EUS and MDCT for pancreatic cancer were compared. Results: Sixty-eight patients with pathologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mean age 63.2±10.9 years) were analyzed. The mean maximal diameters of lesions identified (n = 60) and missed (n = 8) by MDCT were 43.7±15.6 mm and 18.4±2.9 mm, respectively. EUS and MDCT detection rate for pancreatic cancer was 98.5% and 88.2%, respectively. In pancreatic tumors 2 cm in diameter, EUS and MDCT detection rate was 83.3% and 0%, respectively. The pancreatic tumors that were missed by EUS were associated with baseline calcified chronic pancreatitis. Conclusion: EUS had a higher detection rate than MDCT for detection of pancreatic cancer, particularly for small pancreatic tumors. However, it missed pancreatic tumor in a patient with calcified chronic pancreatitis."
"Transcutaneous esophageal ultrasonography in children with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To evaluate the esophageal morphological parameters and occurrence of refluxate using transcutaneous esophageal ultrasonography [US] in children with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], Materials and Methods: Twenty-two children with suspected GERD and 23 healthy controls were enrolled during November 2015 to January 2017. GERD was defined as reflux index and I or liquid refluxate evaluated by multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring greater than the 95th percentile of age-specific values. All subjects underwent transcutaneous esophageal US to assess the occurrence of refluxate and the esophageal morphology. Results: Median age of patients (50% male) and controls (57% male) were 1.6 years (interquartile range 0.6 to 5 years) and 1.7 years (interquartile range 0.5 to 7.5 years), respectively. GERD symptoms were divided into esophageal (n = 11) and extraesophageal (n = 11) manifestations. Occurrence of refluxate and esophageal morphological parameters detected by transcutaneous esophageal US were not different between study and control groups. However, study group tended to have shorter abdominal esophageal length compared with controls (16.8±4.3 mm vs. 18.2±6.5 mm). Study group with GERD confirmed by MII-pH monitoring (n = 6) tended to have higher cervical/ abdominal esophageal wall thickness and diameter, and degree of gastroesophageal angle than those with normal MII-pH monitoring (n = 16), however the differences were not statistically significant. The number of occurrence of refluxate identified by transesophageal US was not significantly different between study group with and without abnormal refluxate detected by MII-pH monitoring. Conclusion: The number of occurrence of refluxate and esophageal morphology evaluated by transcutaneous esophageal US do not correlate well with the MII-pH monitoring results."
"Search for lepton-flavor violating decays of heavy resonances and quantum black holes to eμ final states in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search is reported for heavy resonances decaying into eμ final states in proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC at s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The search focuses on resonance masses above 200 GeV. With no evidence found for physics beyond the standard model in the eμ mass spectrum, upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for this lepton-flavor violating signal. Based on these results, resonant τ sneutrino production in R-parity violating supersymmetric models is excluded for masses below 1.7 TeV, for couplings λ132 = λ231 = λ311′ = 0.01. Heavy Z′ gauge bosons with lepton-flavor violating transitions are excluded for masses up to 4.4 TeV. The eμ mass spectrum is also interpreted in terms of non-resonant contributions from quantum black-hole production in models with one to six extra spatial dimensions, and lower mass limits are found between 3.6 and 5.6 TeV. In all interpretations used in this analysis, the results of this search improve previous limits by about 1 TeV. These limits correspond to the most sensitive values obtained at colliders.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Validation and reliability of the thai version of the oxford shoulder score  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To assess the validity and reliability of Oxford shoulder score Thai version [OSS-TH]. Materials and Methods: The cross-sectional descriptive study of patients with shoulder pain and/or disorders at Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Oxford shoulder score [OSS] is an internationally recognized shoulder-specific patient reported outcomes [PRO] questionnaire. OSS consists of 12 questions that explore various aspects of shoulder-related problems. The higher the OSS score, the more severe the shoulder problem. Construct validity was evaluated by visual analog scale for pain [VAS-pain], Thai version of disability of arm, shoulder, and hand [DASH-TH], and Thai version 2.0 of the medical outcomes study [MOS] short form-36 [SF36-TH]. Reliability was evaluated by internal consistency and test-retest method. Results: One hundred native Thai speaking participants with shoulder pain and/or disorders were included between November 1, 2015 and April 30, 2016. The mean age of the patients was 56.67 years and 70 participants were female. The most common diagnoses were rotator cuff disease (46%) and adhesive capsulitis (40%). A majority of participants were able to complete the OSS-TH questionnaire within approximately 3.5 minutes. OSS-TH significantly highly correlated with DASH-TH (r = 0.82). Regarding the SF36-TH, OSS-TH significantly moderately correlated with the physical role functioning, bodily pain, social role functioning. A Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92 revealed high internal consistency. All patients participated in the test-retest process, for an average time to retest of 4.57 days and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92. Conclusion: The original English language version of the OSS was meticulously translated into Thai language to create the OSS-TH. The findings of the present study demonstrated the acceptable validity and reliability of the OSS-TH. Accordingly, the OSS-TH can be reliably adopted for using as a Thai PRO that is specific to shoulder pain/disorders."
"Vanadate-induced renal cAMP and malondialdehyde accumulation suppresses alpha 1 sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase protein levels  2018, Korean Society of Toxicology.It has been demonstrated that vanadate causes nephrotoxicity. Vanadate inhibits renal sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na, K-ATPase) activity and this is more pronounced in injured renal tissues. Cardiac cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is enhanced by vanadate, while increased cAMP suppresses Na, K-ATPase action in renal tubular cells. There are no in vivo data collectively demonstrating the effect of vanadate on renal cAMP levels; on the abundance of the alpha 1 isoform (α1) of the Na, K-ATPase protein or its cellular localization; or on renal tissue injury. In this study, rats received a normal saline solution or vanadate (5 mg/kg BW) by intraperitoneal injection for 10 days. Levels of vanadium, cAMP, and malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation were measured in renal tissues. Protein abundance and the localization of renal α1-Na, K-ATPase was determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Renal tissue injury was examined by histological evaluation and renal function was assessed by blood biochemical parameters. Rats treated with vanadate had markedly increased vanadium levels in their plasma, urine, and renal tissues. Vanadate significantly induced renal cAMP and MDA accumulation, whereas the protein level of α1-Na, K-ATPase was suppressed. Vanadate caused renal damage, azotemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia. Fractional excretions of all studied electrolytes were increased with vanadate administration. These in vivo findings demonstrate that vanadate might suppress renal α1-Na, K-ATPase protein functionally by enhancing cAMP and structurally by augmenting lipid peroxidation."

Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI. Funded by SCOAP3.A search is presented for heavy vectorlike quarks (VLQs) that couple only to light quarks in proton-proton collisions at s=8 TeV at the LHC. The data were collected by the CMS experiment during 2012 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb-1. Both single and pair production of VLQs are considered. The single-production search is performed for down-type VLQs (electric charge of magnitude 1/3), while the pair-production search is sensitive to up-type (charge of magnitude 2/3) and down-type VLQs. Final states with at least one muon or one electron are considered. No significant excess over standard model expectations is observed, and lower limits on the mass of VLQs are derived. The lower limits range from 400 to 1800 GeV, depending on the single-production cross section and the VLQ branching fractions B to W, Z, and Higgs bosons. When considering pair production alone, VLQs with masses below 845 GeV are excluded for B(W)=1.0, and below 685 GeV for B(W)=0.5, B(Z)=B(H)=0.25. The results are more stringent than those previously obtained for single and pair production of VLQs coupled to light quarks."

"Unraveling haplotype diversity of the apical membrane antigen-1 gene in Plasmodium falciparum populations in Thailand  2018, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine.Development of an effective vaccine is critically needed for the prevention of malaria. One of the key antigens for malaria vaccines is the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the surface protein for erythrocyte invasion of the parasite. The gene encoding AMA-1 has been sequenced from populations of P. falciparum worldwide, but the haplotype diversity of the gene in P. falciparum populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), including Thailand, remains to be characterized. In the present study, the AMA-1 gene was PCR amplified and sequenced from the genomic DNA of 65 P. falciparum isolates from 5 endemic areas in Thailand. The nearly full-length 1,848 nucleotide sequence of AMA-1 was subjected to molecular analyses, including nucleotide sequence diversity, haplotype diversity and deduced amino acid sequence diversity and neutrality tests. Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise population differentiation (Fst indices) were performed to infer the population structure. The analyses identified 60 single nucleotide polymorphic loci, predominately located in domain I of AMA-1. A total of 31 unique AMA-1 haplotypes were identified, which included 11 novel ones. The phylogenetic tree of the AMA-1 haplotypes revealed multiple clades of AMA-1, each of which contained parasites of multiple geographical origins, consistent with the Fst indices indicating genetic homogeneity or gene flow among geographically distinct populations of P. falciparum in Thailand’s borders with Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. In summary, the study revealed novel haplotypes and population structure needed for the further advancement of AMA-1-based malaria vaccines in the GMS."
"Validated RP-HPLC method for quantification of gastrodin in ethanolic extract from the pseudobulbs of grammatophyllum speciosum blumeValidasi kaedah FT-KCPT bagi kuantifikasi gastrodin di dalam ekstrak etanolik dari pseudobulbs grammatophyllum speciosum blume  2018, Malaysian Society of Analytical Sciences. All rights reserved.A reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (RP-HPLC-DAD) method was developed to determine the amount of gastrodin, the major active component of Grammatophyllum speciosum pseudobulbs. A previous study suggested that the ethanolic extract of G. speciosum had a potential to encourage stemness of keratinocytes. Therefore, in order to determine the quality of G. speciosum ethanolic extract, the quantitative analysis of gastrodin should be validated. The optimized RP-HPLC condition was achieved within 18 min, using a column, Inertsil ODS-3 (4.6 x 150 mm, 5 µm). The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of water: acetonitrile with a gradient from 1:99 to 100:0 in 14 minutes and keep constant at 1:99 for 4 minutes. The flow rate was 1.7 mL/min with the monitored UV wavelength of 220 nm. Gastrodin was eluted at the retention time of 6.5 minutes. The calibration curve of gastrodin at the concentration of 10 - 100 µg/mL showed good linearity (r2 = 0.999). In addition, the intraday and interday precisions of gastrodin were 1.05 and 0.38%, respectively. The percentage recovery was within 99.3 - 101.5%. Average gastrodin contents in 3 samples were 55.52 - 58.12 mg/g. The results indicate that this method can be utilized to control the quality of G. speciosum extract."
"Effectiveness of Short Message Service (SMS) intervention for promoting safe sex among army conscripts in a Province in Thailand  2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of Short Message Service (SMS) intervention to promote safe sex among army conscripts in a province in Thailand. Design: A quasi-experimental design. Setting: Military conscripts in Lop Buri province Thailand. Methods: A multi-stage sampling of respondents (n=192) were stratified into 3 groups: 1-way, 2-way SMS and a control groups. Both 1-way and 2-way SMS groups received a text messaging 2 times/weeks during the 3 months of the intervention period. The 2-way SMS group, they were allowed to send SMS back when they need more information. Data were collected at baseline, followed at 1, 3 and 6 months after intervention. Results: Safe sex with condom use was significantly different for 1-way SMS group (p-value<0.05). Abstinence from alcohol drinking before or during having sex was different for 2-way SMS group (p-value<0.05). Discussion and Conclusion: The study has demonstrated the benefits of SMS intervention in promoting safer sex practices either 1-way or 2-way SMS, but a strengthening program is required for fostering safe sex behaviors among army conscripts."
"A chemical safety intervention program designed to reduce occupational exposure among vector control operators in Bangkok, Thailand  2018, Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology. All rights reserved.Background: Vector control operators (VCOs) face occupational risks due to pesticide and chemical exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a chemical safety intervention program designed to reduce occupational exposure among VCOs in Bangkok, Thailand. Method: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in six Bangkok areas among 96 male operators. The operators were divided into two groups: the intervention group received intervention, and the control did not. General participant information, including personal behavior and environmental working conditions, were collected via standardized questionnaires. Urine samples were collected to evaluate biological exposure. A linear mixed model and repeated measure ANOVA were used to compare the differences in outcome measures between the two groups at a baseline and two follow-ups (follow-up 1 and follow-up 2). Results: At the baseline measure, both groups had similar sociodemographic characteristics, personal habits, and environmental working conditions. After the intervention program, the intervention group had effectively reduced difference means for 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), trans, trans-muconic acid (tt-MA) and o-cresol. There were also statistically significant differences between the groups at follow-ups 1 and 2. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the introduction and implementation of chemical safety programs could reduce biological exposure and prevent health symptoms due to chemical exposure among VCOs."
"Measurement of normalized differential t t ¯ cross sections in the dilepton channel from pp collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Normalized differential cross sections for top quark pair production are measured in the dilepton (e+e−, μ+μ−, and μ∓e±) decay channels in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The measurements are performed with data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb−1 using the CMS detector at the LHC. The cross sections are measured differentially as a function of the kinematic properties of the leptons, jets from bottom quark hadronization, top quarks, and top quark pairs at the particle and parton levels. The results are compared to several Monte Carlo generators that implement calculations up to next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics interfaced with parton showering, and also to fixed-order theoretical calculations of top quark pair production up to next-to-next-to-leading order.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Identification and antimicrobial activity of Micromonospora strains from Thai peat swamp forest soils  2018 Chitti Thawai et al.The identification and antimicrobial activity of thirteen actinomycete strains isolated from peat swamp forest soils collected from Narathiwat, Patthaloong and Yala provinces, the southern part of Thailand were carried out. Based on the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, all isolates were belonged to genus Micromonospora. They were separated into six groups based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis and were identified as M. narathiwatensis (Group 1, 5 isolates), M. humi (Group 4, 3 isolates), M. aurantiaca (Group 5, 2 isolates), one of each isolate as M. chalcea (Group 2) and M. maritima (Group 6). The isolate LK6-12 (Group 3) showed low similarity (99.16%) with the type strains of Micromonospora siamensis that will be the novel species of the genus Micromonospora. Meso-diaminopimelic acid (cell wall type II), xylose and arabinose (pattern D) were detected in their whole-cell hydrolysates. The major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine (type II). The predominant cellular fatty acids were C17:0, C17:1ω8c, iso-C16:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, anteiso-C15:0, and anteiso-C17:0. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4), MK-9(H6), or MK-10(H4). The DNA G+C contents of the isolates ranged from 71.6-72.6 mol%. On the primary screening, 2 isolates exhibited the antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Kocuria rhizophila ATCC 9341."

Results are based on data recorded in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The mass range investigated extends upwards from 1.2 TeV. No excess is observed above the estimated standard model background and limits are set at 95% confidence level on cross sections, which are interpreted in terms of various models that predict gravitons, heavy spin-1 bosons, and excited quarks. In a heavy vector triplet model, W′ and Z′ resonances, with masses below 3.2 and 2.7 TeV, respectively, and spin-1 resonances with degenerate masses below 3.8 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. In the case of a singlet W′ resonance masses between 3.3 and 3.6 TeV can be excluded additionally. Similarly, excited quark resonances, q∗, decaying to qW and qZ with masses less than 5.0 and 4.7 TeV, respectively, are excluded. In a narrow-width bulk graviton model, upper limits are set on cross sections ranging from 0.6 fb for high resonance masses above 3.6 TeV, to 36.0 fb for low resonance masses of 1.3 TeV."
"Liver disease burden and required treatment expenditures for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Thailand: Implications for HCV elimination in the new therapeutic era, a population-based study  2018 Wasitthankasem et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been decreasing globally, but the growing effects of HCV-related morbidity and mortality remain of concern. Advances in curative medicine, involving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have led many countries to aim to eradicate HCV. Information on epidemiology and disease burden is essential for national policy development. Thus, this study aimed to determine the HCV-related hepatic disease burden in areas of Thailand with high and average HCV prevalence in order to extrapolate the viral burden across Thailand. Patients previously diagnosed as positive for anti-HCV antibodies were recruited to assess chronic HCV infection (CHC) status, liver function, HCV-RNA level and hepatic fibrosis. The number of patients eligible for Universal Health Coverage (UC) scheme and the approximately required expenditure on interferon (IFN)based treatment were estimated. In areas of both high (12%) and average (2%) HCV viremic prevalence, over half of the patients (52.2% to 62.5%) had advanced liver fibrosis (F3 and F4). A striking percentage of patients with F4 (38.9%) were found in the high-prevalence area, while comparable proportions of advanced liver fibrosis presented in the two areas and disease burden peaked at 50–59 years. Under the current UC program treatment scenario, 78–83% of CHC patients with stage F2–F4 fibrosis were eligible for treatment. The estimated expenditure required for overall CHC treatment across the whole country was 1,240 million USD at this current status, but the declining cost of generic DAA-based therapy may reduce the requirement to <90 million USD. This study provides information on the estimated number of CHC patients, liver disease burden and expenditure requirements for Thailand. To eliminate HCV by 2030, proactive government strategies raising public health to minimize transmission and emphasizing targeted screen-and-treatment programs, novel therapeutic guideline development for decentralizing treatment, and effective budget allocation are urgently needed."
"Enhancement of uranium recovery from seawater using amidoximated polymer gel synthesized from radiation-polymerization and crosslinking of acrylonitrile and methacrylic acid monomers  2018 Elsevier Ltd.The amidoximated polymer gel for uranium recovery from natural seawater was successfully synthesized from radiation-polymerization and crosslinking of acrylonitrile (AN) and methacrylic acid (MAA) monomers with N,N'-Methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) as the crosslink agent. The optimum condition to prepare the polymer gel is: the gamma ray dose of 40kGy, the AN:MAA ratio of 80:20, and the crosslink agent concentration of 8g/L. The polymer gel can be reused for at least 8 times without significant performance decrease. The kinetic of seawater absorption by the adsorbent was quite rapid, reaching the equilibrium swelling ratio of approximately 250% in about 30min. By submersion of this polymer gel in the seawater sample with only 300 and 840ppb of added uranium for 4 weeks, the adsorption capacity reached as much as 6.96 and 9.64mg/g, respectively. By submersion of this polymer gel in the seawater sample with 30 and 2140ppm of added uranium for 1 week, the adsorption capacity reached as much as 334 and 409mg/g, respectively. This high-efficiency amidoxime polymer gel offers a possibility of being utilized as a seawater uranium recovery agent on an industrial scale. Suitable elution conditions to minimize mass loss as well as suitable locations with clear seawater and no algae growth will need to be identified. Moreover, the research outcome presents a novel environmental remediation process to adsorb uranium ions released into seawater following a nuclear accident."
"Layer-by-layer Proton Donor and Acceptor Membrane for an Efficient Proton Transfer System in a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe high performance proton transfer in polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) is known to be achieved through cooperating of proton donors and acceptors. In order to obtain the effective and efficient proton transfer, the present work proposes a membrane with proton donors and proton acceptors in layer-by-layer (LbL) structure. By applying sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) as the substrate membrane and soaking alternatively with the proton donor polymer, i.e. poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and the proton acceptor heterocycles, i.e. benzimidazoles (BI), the LbL SPEEK/BI/PAA membranes can be achieved. The systematic variation based on the branching benzimidazole groups suggest that the LbL SPEEK/BI/PAA membrane obtained shows an increase in proton conductivity compared to the neat SPEEK, especially in the case of the membrane with trifunctional benzimidazole (B4) is as high as 1–2.5 orders of magnitude over the temperature range of 30–170 °C. The present work points out the simple surface modification of the proton conductive membrane by layer-by-layer approach as a practical and simple way to enhance the performance of polymer electrolyte membrane."
"Micro-Costing Analysis Demonstrates Comparable Costs for LithoVue Compared to Reusable Flexible Fiberoptic Ureteroscopes  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Introduction: Reusable ureteroscope durability and need for repair are significant sources of expense and inefficiency for patients and urologists. Utilization of LithoVue™, a disposable flexible digital ureteroscope, may address some of these concerns. To identify its economic impact on clinical care, we performed a micro-cost comparison between flexible reusable fiberoptic ureteroscopes (URF-P6™) and LithoVue. Patients and Methods: For this prospective, single-center micro-costing study, all consecutive ureteroscopies performed during 1 week each in July and August 2016 utilized either URF-P6 or LithoVue ureteroscopes respectively. Workflow data were collected, including intraoperative events, postoperative reprocessing cycle timing, consumables usage, and ureteroscope cost data. Results: Intraoperative data analysis showed mean total operating room time for URF-P6 and LithoVue cases were 93.4 ± 32.3 and 73.6 ± 17.4 minutes, respectively (p = 0.093). Mean cost of operating room usage per case was calculated at 1618.72 ± 441.39 for URF-P6 and 1348.64 ± 237.40 for LithoVue based on institutional cost rates exclusive of disposables. Postoperative data analysis revealed costs of 107.27 for labor and consumables during reprocessing for URF-P6 cases. The costs of ureteroscope repair and capital acquisition for each URF-P6 case were 957.71 and 116.02, respectively. The total ureteroscope cost per case for URF-P6 and LithoVue were 2799.72 and 2852.29, respectively. Conclusions: Micro-cost analysis revealed that the cost of LithoVue acquisition is higher per case compared to reusable fiberoptic ureteroscopes, but savings are realized in labor, consumables, and repair. When accounting for these factors, the total cost per case utilizing these two ureteroscopes were comparable."
"Targeted drug delivery in the suprachoroidal space by swollen hydrogel pushing  2018 The Authors.PURPOSE. The purpose is to target model drug particles to the posterior region of the suprachoroidal space (SCS) of the eye controlled via pushing by hydrogel swelling. METHODS. A particle formulation containing 1% hyaluronic acid (HA) with fluorescent polymer particles and a hydrogel formulation containing 4% HA were introduced in a single syringe as two layers without mixing, and injected sequentially into the SCS of the rabbit eye ex vivo and in vivo using a microneedle. Distribution of particles in the eye was determined by microscopy. RESULTS. During injection, the particle formulation was pushed toward the middle of the SCS by the viscous hydrogel formulation, but less than 12% of particles reached the posterior SCS. After injection, the particle formulation was pushed further toward the macula and optic nerve in the posterior SCS by hydrogel swelling and spreading. Heating the eye to 37°C, or injecting in vivo decreased viscosity and mechanical strength of the hydrogel, thereby allowing it to swell and flow further in the SCS. A high salt concentration (9% NaCl) in the hydrogel formulation further increased hydrogel swelling due to osmotic flow into the hydrogel. In this way, up to 76% of particles were delivered to the posterior SCS from an injection made near the limbus. CONCLUSIONS. This study shows that model drug particles can be targeted to the posterior SCS by HA hydrogel swelling and pushing without particle functionalization or administering external driving forces."
"Photosynthetic refixation varies along the stem and reduces CO2 efflux in mature boreal Pinus sylvestris trees  The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Trees are able to reduce their carbon (C) losses by refixing some of the CO2 diffusing out of their stems through corticular photosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that under ideal conditions the outflowing CO2 can be completely assimilated in metabolically active, young stem and branch tissues. Fewer studies have, however, been carried out on the older stem sections of large trees and, accordingly, the importance of refixation is still unclear under natural environmental conditions. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in refixation in ~90-year-old boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees by utilizing month-long continuous measurements of stem CO2 efflux (Ec) made at four heights along the bole. Refixation rates were found to vary considerably along the bole, leading to a 28% reduction in long-term Ec in the upper stem compared with a negligible reduction at breast height. This vertical pattern correlated with variation in light availability, bark chlorophyll content and bark type. Analysis of the vertical and diurnal patterns in Ec further suggested that the influence of sap flow on the observed daytime reduction in Ec was small. The areal rates of corticular photosynthesis were much lower than previous estimates of photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area from the same trees, implying that the impact of refixation on tree-scale C uptake was small. However, upscaling of refixation indicated that 23–27% of the potential Ec was refixed by the bole and the branches, thereby significantly reducing the woody tissue C losses. Thus, our results suggest that refixation needs to be considered when evaluating the aboveground C cycling of mature P. sylvestris stands and that breast-height estimates should not be extrapolated to the whole tree."
"Racial/ethnic disparities in gallbladder cancer receipt of treatments Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.Background: Gallbladder cancer is a rare malignancy, yet it has a dismal prognosis. Overall survival has improved in all races/ethnicities except Hispanics and blacks. Despite improvements in gallbladder cancer management, it is not clear whether racial/ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis and treatments exist that could potentially be the source of survival disparities. The purpose of this study was to examine race/ ethnicity-specific trends in the stage of disease and receipt of treatments among adult gallbladder cancer patients in the US. Methods: Using the 2000-2013 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries in the US. Race/ethnicity-specific cancer stage at diagnosis and treatments received among adults with gallbladder cancer were evaluated. Differences in gallbladder cancer stage at presentation, treatment modalities and number of lymph nodes (LN) removed among each race/ethnicity were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: A total of 7,507 patients with gallbladder cancer were included. There were no racial/ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis. With regard to disparities in treatments, blacks were significantly less likely to receive curative surgery compared to whites [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.80; P<0.001]. No racial/ethnic disparities in radiation therapy were observed. In patients undergoing curative surgery, Hispanics were significantly less likely to have optimal LN clearance compared to whites (AOR 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47-0.74; P<0.001). After stratification into 2-time periods (2000 to 2006 and 2007 to 2013), racial/ethnic disparities in treatments seemed to be more pronounced over time. Conclusions: Among US adults with gallbladder cancer, no racial/ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis were observed. However, blacks, and Hispanics were less likely to receive curative surgery, and optimal LN clearance than Whites, which are consistent with the lack of survival improvements in those groups and they should be target groups for future studies to address treatment disparities."
"Search for new physics in events with a leptonically decaying Z boson and a large transverse momentum imbalance in proton–proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.A search for new physics in events with a Z boson produced in association with large missing transverse momentum at the LHC is presented. The search is based on the 2016 data sample of proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS experiment at s=13TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1. The results of this search are interpreted in terms of a simplified model of dark matter production via spin-0 or spin-1 mediators, a scenario with a standard-model-like Higgs boson produced in association with the Z boson and decaying invisibly, a model of unparticle production, and a model with large extra spatial dimensions. No significant deviations from the background expectations are found, and limits are set on relevant model parameters, significantly extending the results previously achieved in this channel."
"A new section of Lower Palaeozoic rocks in Kayin State (Southeast Myanmar)  2018 The Geologists’ AssociationLower Palaeozoic rocks have been mapped in Kayin State in an area previously shown on published maps as either metamorphic or possibly Lower or Upper Palaeozoic rocks. Three new formations, with a total thickness of over 900 m, apparently overlain by an, at least, 100 m thick Upper Palaeozoic formation are mapped along the Salween River and along the road from Yinbaing, in Myanmar, to Tha Song Yang, in Thailand. The Lower Palaeozoic succession consists of the predominantly siliciclastic Kyaukpulu and Kushwe–e–we formations and an overlying, predominantly carbonate Meseik Ashe Formation which contains Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian) conodonts. The older two formations are probable correlates of the Ngwetaung and Lokeypin formations of the southern Shan State of Myanmar and the Lower Ordovician siliciclastics of western Thailand. The overlying, peritidal to shallow subtidal carbonates of the Meseik–Ashe Formation are correlates of the Wunbye and Sitha formations of Shan State, Myanmar. The thick–bedded, quartz arenites of the Nyaungwiang Formation are faulted against the Ordovician carbonates and are probable lithological correlates of the Carboniferous Taungnyo Formation. The folds in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks are overturned to the northeast and deformation was in one major phase between the Tournaisian and the Early Permian. The Lower Palaeozoic strata may probably be followed as a ridge for at least 100 km towards the NNW, close to the western border of the Sibuma Block which is separated by a postulated cryptic suture from the Irrawaddy Block to the west."
"Measurement of associated Z + charm production in proton–proton collisions at √s=8TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.A study of the associated production of a Z boson and a charm quark jet (Z + c), and a comparison to production with a b quark jet (Z + b), in p p collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8TeV are presented. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7fb-1, collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The Z boson candidates are identified through their decays into pairs of electrons or muons. Jets originating from heavy flavour quarks are identified using semileptonic decays of c or b flavoured hadrons and hadronic decays of charm hadrons. The measurements are performed in the kinematic region with two leptons with pTℓ>20GeV, | ηℓ| < 2.1 , 71<m111GeV, and heavy flavour jets with pTjet>25GeV and | ηjet| < 2.5. The Z + c production cross section is measured to be σ(pp→Z+c+X)B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-)=8.8±0.5(stat)±0.6(syst)pb. The ratio of the Z + c and Z + b production cross sections is measured to be σ(pp→Z+c+X)/σ(pp→Z+b+X)=2.0±0.2(stat)±0.2(syst). The Z + c production cross section and the cross section ratio are also measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the Z boson and of the heavy flavour jet. The measurements are compared with theoretical predictions."
"Crystallisation of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, and Cl) trihalide perovskite using PbI2 and PbCl2 precursors  The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.In this work, the effects of halides on the properties of mixed-halide perovskite films are investigated. The films were prepared by sequential deposition two-step technique. PbI2 or PbI2-PbCl2 solution was first spin-coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide glasses, and CH3NH3(IxBry) solution, with different molar ratio of I− and Br− (1:0, 2:1, 4:1, 1:4, 1:2, and 0:1), was subsequently coated on top. Then, the films were annealed at 90°C for 1 h and 100°C for 25 min to transform into perovskite structure. The characterisation of perovskite films included X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the incorporation of Br− and/or Cl− in iodine-based perovskites, i.e. CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3 and CH3NH3Pb(I1−x−yBrxCly)3, would enlarge their bandgap. However, with the use of PbI2 precursor, excess PbI2 occurred and resulted in minor affects on the structural and optical properties. The use of PbCl2 as chlorine source was also found to affect the quality of the film morphology. The analysis in this study could provide another insightful aspect for understanding the role of halides in the synthesis of mixed-halide perovskites."

Strain WPS1-2T exhibited identical characteristics to the members of the genus Micromonospora. Single spores were observed directly on substrate mycelia. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of the strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and 3-OH-meso-diaminopimelic acid. Whole-cell hydrolysates contained glucose, ribose, arabinose and xylose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-10(H8) and MK-10(H10). The major cellular fatty acids consisted of iso-C15 : 0, iso-C16 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0. According to the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain, WPS1-2T showed highest similarity to Micromonospora costi CS1-12T (99.02 %). Phylogenetic analysis of the gyrase subunit B (gyrB) gene indicated that the strain was related to M. costi CS1-12T. The DNA G+C content was 73.7 mol%. The strain could be distinguished from closely related type strains by using a combination of morphological, chemotaxonomic, physiological and biochemical data together with DNA-DNA relatedness values. Based on these observations, strain WPS1-2T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Micromonospora, for which the name Micromonospora globbae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WPS1-2T (=KCTC 39787T=NBRC 112325T=TISTR 2405T)."
"First human impacts and responses of aquatic systems: A review of palaeolimnological records from around the world  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.Lake sediments constitute natural archives of past environmental changes. Historically, research has focused mainly on generating regional climate records, but records of human impacts caused by land use and exploitation of freshwater resources are now attracting scientific and management interests. Long-term environmental records are useful to establish ecosystem reference conditions, enabling comparisons with current environments and potentially allowing future trajectories to be more tightly constrained. Here we review the timing and onset of human disturbance in and around inland water ecosystems as revealed through sedimentary archives from around the world. Palaeolimnology provides access to a wealth of information reflecting early human activities and their corresponding aquatic ecological shifts. First human impacts on aquatic systems and their watersheds are highly variable in time and space. Landscape disturbance often constitutes the first anthropogenic signal in palaeolimnological records. While the effects of humans at the landscape level are relatively easily demonstrated, the earliest signals of human-induced changes in the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems need very careful investigation using multiple proxies. Additional studies will improve our understanding of linkages between human settlements, their exploitation of land and water resources, and the downstream effects on continental waters."
"Comparison of preemptive therapy and antiviral prophylaxis for prevention of cytomegalovirus in seropositive liver transplant recipients Copyright  2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Background Few studies have directly compared preemptive therapy (PET) and antiviral prophylaxis (AP) for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in CMV seropositive (R+) orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients. Methods We prospectively assessed CMV disease and clinical outcomes among 160 consecutive R+ OLT recipients who received PET (weekly plasma CMV PCR for 3 months, oral valganciclovir 900 mg twice daily for CMV viremia >250 IU/mL, until 2 consecutive negative weekly PCR results) and compared them with a historical cohort of 156 R+ recipients who received AP (valganciclovir, 900 mg daily for 3 months). Results Patient characteristics were similar between PET and AP cohorts (P > 0.05 all comparisons). In the PET group, 24% (39/160) developed CMV viremia greater than 250 IU/mL at a median of 42 (range, 7-93) days post-OLT. CMV monitoring adherence in the PET cohort was 85% (1488/1760 required tests) and 86% (30/36) initiated PET within 3 days of the CMV result. By 12 months post-OLT, the incidence of CMV disease, acute allograft rejection, major infection, or death in the PET and AP cohorts was not significantly different: 2% versus 2%, 19% versus 16%, 10.5% versus 10.8%, and 5% versus 8%, respectively (P > 0.05 all comparisons). The estimated proportion of drug-exposed patients and average antiviral drug exposure were significantly lower with PET versus AP: 24% versus 100%, P < 0.001, and 15.8 versus 81 g per patient, P < 0.001, respectively. Conclusions PET is feasible in a nonresearch setting and is associated with similar CMV disease rates and other clinically relevant outcomes to AP in CMV seropositive liver transplant recipients."
"Effect of gamma irradiation on properties of ultrafine rubbers as toughening filler in polybenzoxazine  2018 Elsevier LtdThree types of ultrafine fully vulcanized powdered rubbers (UFRs), i.e. natural rubber (NR), carboxylated nitrile-butadiene rubber (XNBR), and carboxylated styrene-butadiene rubber (XSBR) were prepared by combined technology between gamma irradiation for crosslinking and spray drying. The effects of doses in a range of 0–250 kGy on swelling ratio, crosslink density, and thermal stability of UFRs were investigated. Smaller particle size of UFRs was obtained at higher dose. A decrease in the swelling ratio and an increase in crosslink density were well corresponded to crosslinking effect related with absorbed dose. The increase in dose was also found to improve thermal performance of URFs. The influence of irradiated UFRs on impact resistance and glass transition temperature (Tg) of polybenzoxazine composites was also evaluated. The highest impact resistance of the composites belonged to the composite filled with irradiated UFXNBR at 200 kGy. While the significantly enhanced Tg of the composite was obtained by an addition of irradiated UFRs with higher doses, i.e. Tg = 173 °C for the composite filled with irradiated UFXNBR at 250 kGy. As a consequence, the UFRs can be used to effectively modify thermal and mechanical properties, especially impact resistance of polybenzoxazine composites."
"Application of the region–time–length algorithm to study of earthquake precursors in the Thailand–Laos–Myanmar borders  2018, Indian Academy of Sciences.In order to examine the precursory seismic quiescence of upcoming hazardous earthquakes, the seismicity data available in the vicinity of the Thailand–Laos–Myanmar borders was analyzed using the Region–Time–Length (RTL) algorithm based statistical technique. The utilized earthquake data were obtained from the International Seismological Centre. Thereafter, the homogeneity and completeness of the catalogue were improved. After performing iterative tests with different values of the r0 and t0 parameters, those of r0 = 120 km and t0 = 2 yr yielded reasonable estimates of the anomalous RTL scores, in both temporal variation and spatial distribution, of a few years prior to five out of eight strong-to-major recognized earthquakes. Statistical evaluation of both the correlation coefficient and stochastic process for the RTL were checked and revealed that the RTL score obtained here excluded artificial or random phenomena. Therefore, the prospective earthquake sources mentioned here should be recognized and effective mitigation plans should be provided."
"Anterior Segment Imaging for Angle Closure  2018 Elsevier Inc.Purpose: To summarize the role of anterior segment imaging (AS-imaging) in angle closure diagnosis and management, and the possible advantages over the current standard of gonioscopy. Design: Literature review and perspective. Methods: Review of the pertinent publications with interpretation and perspective in relation to the use of AS-imaging in angle closure assessment focusing on anterior segment optical coherence tomography and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Results: Several limitations have been encountered with the reference standard of gonioscopy for angle assessment. AS-imaging has been shown to have performance in angle closure detection compared to gonioscopy. Also, imaging has greater reproducibility and serves as better documentation for long-term follow-up than conventional gonioscopy. The qualitative and quantitative information obtained from AS-imaging enables better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of angle closure and provides useful parameters for risk assessment and possible prediction of the response to laser and surgical intervention. The latest technologies—including 3-dimensional imaging—have allowed for the assessment of the angle that simulates the gonioscopic view. These advantages suggest that AS-imaging has a potential to be a reference standard for the diagnosis and monitoring of angle closure disease in the future. Conclusions: Although gonioscopy remains the primary method of angle assessment, AS-imaging has an increasing role in angle closure screening and management. The test should be integrated into clinical practice as an adjunctive tool for angle assessment. It is arguable that AS-imaging should be considered first-line screening for patients at risk for angle closure."
"The Chern-Simons Current in Systems of DNA-RNA Transcriptions  2018 by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA Chern-Simons current, coming from ghost and anti-ghost fields of supersymmetry theory, can be used to define a spectrum of gene expression in new time series data where a spinor field, as alternative representation of a gene, is adopted instead of using the standard alphabet sequence of bases A, T, C, G, U. After a general discussion on the use of supersymmetry in biological systems, we give examples of the use of supersymmetry for living organism, discuss the codon and anti-codon ghost fields and develop an algebraic construction for the trash DNA, the DNA area which does not seem active in biological systems. As a general result, all hidden states of codon can be computed by Chern-Simons 3 forms. Finally, we plot a time series of genetic variations of viral glycoprotein gene and host T-cell receptor gene by using a gene tensor correlation network related to the Chern-Simons current. An empirical analysis of genetic shift, in host cell receptor genes with separated cluster of gene and genetic drift in viral gene, is obtained by using a tensor correlation plot over time series data derived as the empirical mode decomposition of Chern-Simons current."
"Comparison of disease activity between tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in lupus nephritis: a randomized controlled trial  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.We conducted a prospective multicenter, opened-label, parallel, randomized, controlled trial to compare tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for induction and maintenance therapy in lupus nephritis (LN). Adult patients with biopsy-proven LN International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society classes III–V and active nephritis were to receive prednisolone (0.7–1.0 mg/kg/day for four weeks of run-in period and tapered) and randomly assigned to receive TAC (0.1 mg/kg/day) or MMF (1.5–2 g/day) as induction therapy for six months. All patients who had remission received azathioprine (AZA) 1–2 mg/kg/day as standard treatment in the maintenance phase. The primary outcome was Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) at six and 12 months, and the secondary outcomes included renal SLEDAI, non-renal SLEDAI, modified SLEDAI-2K, immunity SLEDAI, and disease activity remission. Eighty-four patients were randomized. One patient who was randomized to the TAC group withdrew from the study immediately after randomization. Therefore, 42 patients received MMF and 41 patients received TAC. Disease activity remission rate and time to disease activity remission were similar in both groups. Twelve patients (28.57%) in the MMF group and 10 patients (24.39%) in the TAC group achieved disease activity remission. For disease activity scores, both regimens significantly improved SLEDAI-2K during induction and maintenance therapy. Overall, SLEDAI-2K score in the MMF group decreased more compared with the TAC group. In the MMF group, mean SLEDAI-2K decreased from 11.6 ± 4.8 to 6.3 ± 3.9 after induction therapy and to 5.4 ± 4.4 after maintenance therapy. In the TAC group, mean SLEDAI-2K decreased from 9.0 ± 3.7 to 6.3 ± 5.1 after induction therapy and to 7.1 ± 5.4 after maintenance therapy. Renal SLEDAI and modified SLEDAI-2K showed a similar pattern with SLEDAI-2K. In non-renal SLEDAI and immunity SLEDAI, both regimens also resulted in decreased disease activity scores during the first two months. After that the scores were slightly increased. In the MMF group, the scores were still lower than baseline but in the TAC group were not. In conclusion, disease activity remission rate was similar in the MMF and TAC groups. For disease activity score as measured by SLEDAI-2K, TAC was comparable with MMF during induction but MMF was more effective on disease activity of active LN classes III and IV at 12 months, especially in the renal system."
"Game for Low-Formal Education Farmers to Learn How to Improve Soil Quality  2018,  The Author(s) 2018.Background. Many Thai farmers who live in national parks farmlands lack a formal education. They usually lack of knowledge on soil quality improvement and proper use of fertilizer. They illegally trespass in forest areas because of soil deterioration in their own limited expanses of farmland. Consequently, most of them are arrested, creating individual and family problems. Aim. This “soil analysis and appropriate fertilizer use game” (SAAFU game) was designed for farmers having low-formal education to realize the soil analysis before planting and improve the appropriate chemical fertilizer usage. Method.This quasi-experiential research used pre- and post-tests to evaluate the game session processes and learning of the players. The important steps were: 1) analysis of soil in the land box; 2) making decisions to buy fertilizer; 3) calculating, harvesting and selling products. Debriefing was also used to discuss and exchange their knowledge and experiences. Follow up process was also performed. Results. The pre- and post-test score showed the better understanding of appropriate fertilizer use of the players. Soon after the gaming sessions, players went to their fields and collected 31 soil samples for soil nutrient analysis. Players also disseminated knowledge to their relatives and neighbors. As a result, non-players of Dongbak(22), Wangmon(9) and Chaimongkol(2) collected soil samples for soil nutrient analysis. Moreover, they grouping together to buy quicklime and fertilizers to get cheaper price. Conclusion. This simple game can be used effectively with farmers having low-formal education. After the game and simulation, most of them realized how important of soil nutrients and soil analysis before planting and were able to teach their relatives and neighbours about soil collecting. This indicated the successful of this game."
"Synthesis and characterization of poly(2-chloroaniline) by chemical oxidative polymerization  2017, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.Nano-scaled P2ClAn was synthesized via chemical oxidation polymerization. The effects of oxidant concentration, surfactant type and concentration on the synthesized P2ClAn were investigated. Electrical conductivity results revealed that the undoped P2ClAn synthesized by APS at the monomer:oxidant mole ratio of 1:1 was the most suitable condition to yield the highest P2ClAn electrical conductivity. The morphological structures of P2ClAn changed from an irregular-shaped structure to a cylinder shape or a flake-like shape depending on the surfactant type and concentration. P2ClAn in the presence of SDS, used as a surfactant template, provided particles with an average nanosize of 56.2 nm and higher electrical conductivity than using CTAB. Further doping process of P2ClAn was studied using HClO4. The electrical conductivity of the doped dP2ClAn/SDS50 increased by three orders of magnitude, at the monomer:doping mole ratio of 1:25 possessing the highest electrical conductivity of 10.47 S cm−1, relative to the synthesized P2ClAn without doping."
"Morphological and dose-dependent study on the effect of methyl, hexyl, and dodecyl rosmarinate on staphylococcus carnosus LTH1502: Use of the Weibull model  2018, International Association for Food Protection.The mechanisms of three antimicrobial rosmarinates (methyl-RE1, hexyl-RE6, and dodecyl-RE12) were investigated against Staphylococcus carnosus LTH1502. Scanning electron microscopy was used to determine the morphology of treated cells to gain information on potential changes in the site of action of compounds. The survival data obtained from antimicrobial activity assays were fitted to a nonlinear Weibull model to assess changes in inactivation behavior. Generally, esters became more effective with increasing length of the alkyl chain, resulting in a lower concentration for inhibition and inactivation. Weibull distribution parameters showed a downward concave inactivation pattern for RE1 above a critical concentration, indicative of a delayed log phase of the antimicrobial activity, with few cells being inactivated immediately after treatment and more cells being affected at later times. In contrast, esters having longer alkyl chains (RE6 and RE12) had an upward concave inactivation behavior, with more cells being inactivated immediately after addition of compounds. Cellular morphologies suggest that the antimicrobial mode of action of esters transitions from one that acts intracellularly (RE1) to one that predominately affects bacterial membrane (RE6 and RE12) due to changes in physicochemical properties of esters. Assessment that is based on the parameters of the Weibull model could, thus, be used to evaluate antimicrobial efficiency, in addition to MIC."
"Optimization and mechanisms of As(III) removal from aqueous solution using Fe-MCM-41 immobilized on GAC  2018 Elsevier Ltd.Groundwater contaminated with high arsenic (As) concentration has become a global problem of health concerns for many decades. Therefore, a removal of As is an urgent action needed for countries where the groundwater is a main source of drinking water. The objectives of this work were to study i) the removal mechanisms and effects of solution pH, adsorbent loading, and initial concentration on As adsorption by Fe-MCM-41/GAC and ii) the interference effects of anions and cations on the adsorption process. The Box-Behnken Design (BBD) based on Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied for the batch experimental designs. Comparing to GAC, higher adsorption rate and capacity were found in the Fe-MCM-41/GAC. The experimental results which fit well to Freundlich isotherm confirmed a multi-layer adsorption on adsorbent surface. The maximum adsorption capacity of Fe-MCM-41/GAC was 133 μg g-1. The sorption energy of As(III) ranging from 0.0415 to 0.0451 kJ mol-1 indicating that As(III) adsorption process on Fe-MCM-41/GAC is a physisorption. The adsorption was a rate controlling step for As(III) removal. The increases in solution pH and initial As(III) concentration caused a reduction in the removal efficiency. While, higher adsorbent loading resulted in an increase in removal efficiency. For the interference effects, 25% and 50% reduction in the removal efficiencies were found when NO3- and SO42-, respectively, were increased from 500 to 1000 μg L-1. In contrast, 40% and 10% increases in removal efficiencies were found when Fe3+ and Mn2+, respectively, were increased to 1000 μg L-1."
"Using geospatial data for decision making for a MSW management plan in the city: a case study in Bangkok, Thailand  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Under the pressure of rapid urbanization, many cities encounter a great challenge in providing decent and efficient waste management service. Many ongoing and previous studies have experimented with various techniques to provide suggestions and alternatives to improve solid waste management in urbanized areas. There is a demand for the development of high-impact information and detailed planning approaches, which can lead to effective waste management. The goal of this research is to analyze how to apply various sets of performance indicators as a predetermined parameter to prioritize hot spots in waste generation and handling in the city. Due to limited resources in the public finance sectors of government agencies, tackling solid waste issues with the most effective efforts will help solve the problem more quickly and efficiently. The study examined how geospatial data can be used to assist with municipal solid waste management planning and monitoring. The study determined how to use a set of waste management indicators to better manage solid waste issues in the city of Bangkok. Hot spot areas are identified and mapped using geographic information systems (GIS). Results indicate that 85% of hot spot areas are located near the On Nuch transfer station, and ~ 70% of hot spot areas are located in the central and southern zones of Bangkok. Ultimately, the research analyzed information to develop a short-term recommendation that focuses on improving waste pickup schedules and routing and on providing a long-term recommendation for reducing waste generation rates and improving waste management technology in sub-district areas. This study can provide a foundation for how to select a set of indicators and use geospatial data to better assist with environmental management planning to make recommendations in any urbanized city."
"The Cytochrome P450 3A5 Non-Expressor Kidney Allograft as a Risk Factor for Calcineurin Inhibitor Nephrotoxicity  2018 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.Background: Tacrolimus is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5), which is expressed in the liver. However, CYP3A5 is also expressed in the kidney tissue and may contribute to local tacrolimus clearance in the kidney allograft. We aimed to evaluate the association between the allograft CYP3A5 genotype and transplant outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand, comparing 2 groups of donor and recipient CYP3A5 genotypes, the expressor (∗1/∗1 and ∗1/∗3) and the non-expressor (∗3/∗3). The primary outcomes were allograft complications including calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity and acute rejection episode. Results: Of the 50 enrolled patients, 21 donors were expressors and 29 donors were the non-expressors. Tacrolimus trough concentrations were similar between the 2 genotypes. The incidence of CNI nephrotoxicity was higher in recipients with non-expressor donor genotype compared with the expressor donor genotype (72.4 vs. 33.3%, p = 0.006). CNI nephrotoxicity incidence was not different when recipient's genotypes were compared. Multivariate analysis from Cox-regression showed a hazard ratio of 3.18 (p = 0.026) for CNI nephrotoxicity in the non-expressor compared with the expressor donor. The recipient CYP3A5 genotypes did not significantly contribute to CNI nephrotoxicity. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the lowest CNI nephrotoxicity-free survival in recipients with the expressor genotype who received allograft from the non-expressor donors (p = 0.005). Conclusion: In conclusion, our results suggest that donor CYP3A5 non-expressor genotype (∗3/∗3) is a risk for CNI nephrotoxicity."
"Germ line IgM is sufficient, but not required, for antibodymediated alphavirus clearance from the central nervous system  2018 American Society for Microbiology.Sindbis virus (SINV) infection of neurons in the brain and spinal cord in mice provides a model system for investigating recovery from encephalomyelitis and antibody-mediated clearance of virus from the central nervous system (CNS). To determine the roles of IgM and IgG in recovery, we compared the responses of immunoglobulin-deficient activation-induced adenosine deaminase-deficient (AID-/-), secretory IgM-deficient (sIgM-/-), and AID-/- sIgM-/- double-knockout (DKO) mice with those of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice for disease, clearance of infectious virus and viral RNA from brain and spinal cord, antibody responses, and B cell infiltration into the CNS. Because AID is essential for immunoglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, AID-/- mice produce only germ line IgM, while sIgM-/- mice secrete IgG but no IgM and DKO mice produce no secreted immunoglobulin. After intracerebral infection with the TE strain of SINV, most mice recovered. Development of neurologic disease occurred slightly later in sIgM-/- mice, but disease severity, weight loss, and survival were similar between the groups. AID-/- mice produced high levels of SINV-specific IgM, while sIgM-/- mice produced no IgM and high levels of IgG2a compared to WT mice. All mice cleared infectious virus from the spinal cord, but DKO mice failed to clear infectious virus from brain and had higher levels of viral RNA in the CNS late after infection. The numbers of infected cells and the amount of cell death in brain were comparable. We conclude that antibody is required and that either germ line IgM or IgG is sufficient for clearance of virus from the CNS."
"Perampanel, an AMPA receptor antagonist: From clinical research to practice in clinical settings  2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdEpileptic seizures are refractory to treatment in approximately one-third of patients despite the recent introduction of many newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Development of novel AEDs therefore remains a high priority. Perampanel is a first-in-class non-competitive selective AMPA receptor antagonist with a unique mechanism of action. Clinical efficacy and safety of perampanel as adjunctive treatment for focal seizures with/without secondary generalization (±SG) and primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures have been established in five phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a long-term extension study, and perampanel is approved as monotherapy for focal seizures ±SG in the USA. In patients with focal seizures ±SG, add-on perampanel resulted in median percent reduction in seizure frequency 23.3%-34.5% and ≥50% responder rate 28.5%-37.6%; in PGTC seizures, these results were 76.5% and 64.2%, respectively. Efficacy among adolescents (reduction in seizure frequency 34.8%-35.6%; ≥50% responder rate 40.9%-45.0%) and elderly people (reduction in seizure frequency 12.5%-16.9%; ≥50% responder rate 22.2%-42.9%) is similar to those in adults, and results remain comparable between Asian (reduction in seizure frequency 17.3%-38.0%) and global populations. Perampanel has been extensively studied in real-world clinical practice, with similar efficacy and safety results to the RCTs (≥50% responder rate 12.8%-75.0%; adverse events of somnolence/sedation, dizziness, ataxia, and behavioral changes). Real-world observational studies suggest that perampanel tolerability can be improved by slow titration (2 mg every 2-4 weeks), and bedtime administration can mitigate somnolence and dizziness. Counseling about the potential for behavioral changes and close monitoring are recommended."
"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and their clinical significance  2018, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are a group of autoantibodies that cause systemic vascular inflammation by binding to target antigens of neutrophils. These autoantibodies can be found in serum from patients with systemic small-vessel vasculitis and they are considered as a biomarker for ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). A conventional screening test to detect ANCA in the serum is indirect immunofluorescence study, and subsequently confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A positive staining of ANCA can be classified into three main categories based on the staining patterns: cytoplasmic, perinuclear, and atypical. Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) mostly have a positive cytoplasmic staining pattern (c-ANCA) whilst a perinuclear pattern (p-ANCA) is more common in microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) patients. Atypical pattern (a-ANCA) is rarely seen in patients with systemic small-vessel vasculitis but it can be found in other conditions. Here, techniques for ANCA detection, ANCA staining patterns and their clinical significances are reviewed."
"Antiviral activities of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm.f.) Lindau extract against Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 in koi (Cyprinus carpio koi)  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdCyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) or koi herpesvirus (KHV) is a virulent viral infection in common carp and koi. The disease has caused global epizootic and economic loss in fish aquaculture and in the wild. Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau is a well-known medicinal plant used in Thai traditional medicine. Virucidal effects of the plant extract against human herpes simplex virus have been reported. In this study, C. nutans crude extract was tested for antiviral activities against CyHV-3 in koi carp. Results showed effective antiviral activity against CyHV-3 pre- and post-infection. The 50% lethal concentration (LC50) of extract was higher than 5 mg/ml. The 50% effective dose (ED50) was 0.99 mg/ml, 0.78 mg/ml, 0.75 mg/ml and 0.71 mg/ml at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hr pre-infection, respectively. The ED50 from post-infection tests was 2.05 mg/ml and 2.34 mg/ml at 0 and 24 hr, respectively. These results demonstrated that crude extract expressed antiviral activity against CyHV-3 and can be applied as a therapeutic agent in common carp and koi aquaculture."
"AAV1.NT-3 gene therapy increases muscle fiber diameter through activation of mTOR pathway and metabolic remodeling in a CMT mouse model  2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) has well-recognized effects on peripheral nerve and Schwann cells, promoting axonal regeneration and associated myelination. In this study, we assessed the effects of AAV.NT-3 gene therapy on the oxidative state of the neurogenic muscle from the TremblerJ (Tr J ) mice at 16 weeks post-gene injection and found that the muscle fiber size increase was associated with a change in the oxidative state of muscle fibers towards normalization of the fiber type ratio seen in the wild type. NT-3-induced fiber size increase was most prominent for the fast twitch glycolytic fiber population. These changes in the Tr J muscle were accompanied by increased phosphorylation levels of 4E-BP1 and S6 proteins as evidence of mTORC1 activation. In parallel, the expression levels of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PGC1α, and the markers of glycolysis (HK1 and PK1) increased in the TrJ muscle. In vitro studies showed that recombinant NT-3 can directly induce Akt/mTOR pathway activation in the TrkC expressing myotubes but not in myoblasts. In addition, myogenin expression levels were increased in myotubes while p75 NTR expression was downregulated compared to myoblasts, indicating that NT-3 induced myoblast differentiation is associated with mTORC1 activation. These studies for the first time have shown that NT-3 increases muscle fiber diameter in the neurogenic muscle through direct activation of mTOR pathway and that the fiber size increase is more prominent for fast twitch glycolytic fibers."
"A new design equation for drained stability of conical slopes in cohesive-frictional soils  2018 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of SciencesNew plasticity solutions to the drained stability of conical slopes in homogeneous cohesive-frictional soils were investigated by axisymmetric finite element limit analysis. Three parameters were studied, i.e. excavated height ratios, slope inclination angles, and soil friction angles. The influences of these parameters on the stability factor and predicted failure mechanism of conical slopes were discussed. A new design equation developed from a nonlinear regression of the lower bound solution was proposed for drained stability analyses of a conical slope in practice. Numerical examples were given to demonstrate a practical application of the proposed equation to stability evaluations of conical slopes with both associated and non-associated flow rules."
"Metabolic responses of Aspergillus terreus under low dissolved oxygen and pH levels  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and the University of Milan.The metabolic responses of Aspergillus terreus NRRL1960 to stress conditions (low dissolved oxygen and pH with limited nitrogen and phosphate) in the two-phase fermentation were investigated in this study. The fermentation kinetics suggested that itaconate production was suppressed under low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. A slight change in pH caused a significant change in itaconate production. The transcriptomic data revealed that under low DO concentration, the glycolytic pathway was uncoupled from the oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in the activation of substrate-level phosphorylation as an alternative route for ATP regeneration. The downregulation of pdh genes, the genes encoding ATP synthase and succinate dehydrogenase, confirmed the observation of the uncoupling of the oxidative TCA cycle from glycolysis. It was found that the upregulation of pyc resulted in a large pool of oxaloacetate in the cytosol. This induced the conversion of oxaloacetate to malate. The upregulation of the gene encoding fumarate hydratase with the subsequent formation of fumarate was found to be responsible for the regeneration of NADPH and ATP under the condition of a low dissolved oxygen level. The large pool of oxaloacetate drove itaconic acid production also via the oxidative TCA cycle. Nevertheless, the downregulation of ATP synthase genes resulted in the deficiency of the proton-pumping H+ ATPase and the subsequent stress due to the failure to maintain the physiological pH. This resulted in itaconate production at a low titer. The fermentation kinetics and the transcriptomic data provided in this study can be used for further process optimization and control to improve itaconate production performance."
"Isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of poly(butylene succinate) with nanoprecipitated calcium carbonate as nucleating agent  2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) nanocomposites filled with nanoprecipitated calcium carbonate (NPCC) were prepared via melt blending. The hybrid materials were crystallized under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions in order to understand the influence of NPCC on the crystallization behavior of PBS matrix. For both of these conditions, the nucleating effect induced by the addition of NPCC was clearly shown by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) additionally to an increase of crystallinity. The analysis of isothermal crystallization by Avrami theory allowed to notice a variation of the crystallization mechanism in the presence of the filler and the apparition of secondary stage crystallization. The nanocomposites exhibited higher nucleation activity than the neat PBS and a faster crystallization process as indicated by the values of the half-time of crystallization. Ozawa and Mo theory applied on DSC data highlighted the variations of PBS crystallization behavior in the presence of NPCC. Finally, the crystallization ability of each material was evaluated via the theories of Takhor and Augis–Bennett. The crystallization activation energy showed a promotion of polymer chain diffusion that was correlated with the simultaneous apparition of secondary crystallization stage."
"Implementing national strategies on antimicrobial resistance in Thailand: potential challenges and solutions  2018 The Royal Society for Public HealthBackground: Thailand has developed a national strategic plan on antimicrobial resistance (NSP-AMR) and endorsed by the Cabinet in August 2016. This study reviewed the main contents of the NSP-AMR and the mandates of relevant implementing agencies and identified challenges and recommends actions to mitigate implementation gaps. Methods: This study analysed the contents of NSP-AMR, reviewed institutional mandates and assessed the implementation gaps among agencies responsible for NSP-AMR. Results: Two of six strategies are related to monitoring and surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumption in human and animal. Two other strategies aim to improve antibiotic stewardship and control the spread of AMR in both clinical and farm settings. The remaining two strategies aim to increase knowledge and public awareness on AMR and establish national governance for inter-sectoral actions. Strategies to overcome implementation challenges are sustaining cross-sectoral policy commitments, effective cross-sectoral coordination using One Health approach, generating evidence which guides policy implementation, and improving enforcement capacities in regulatory authorities. Conclusions: To address AMR, Thailand requires significant improvements in implementation capacities in two dimensions. First, technical capacities among implementing agencies are needed to translate policies into practice. Second, governance and organizational capacities enable effective multi-sectoral actions across human, animal, and environmental sectors."
"Elevated HPV16 E1 Expression Is Associated with Cervical Cancer Progression  2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.Objectives: The primary replication protein, HPV E1, has been shown to play a role in mitigating host defence and disrupting normal cell cycle processes, leading to the development of cancer. This study investigated the expression profile of HPV16 E1 in various stages of cervical cancer development and the factors that control E1 expression. Methods: One hundred and twenty-four HPV16-positive cervical samples ranging from normal to CIN 1, CIN 2/3, and SCC lesions were studied. E1 mRNA expression was determined by ddPCR. Methylation of promoters p97 and p670 was quantified by pyrosequencing, while PCR, qPCR, and sequencing were used to determine the physical state and variations of the HPV16 E1 genome. Results: Increased E1 mRNA expression related to disease progression (normal 0.18, CIN 1 0.41, CIN 2/3 0.65, and SCC 0.79) was demonstrated with a significant positive correlation (r = 0.661, p = 0.019). No association between physical state and E1 expression was found. Methylation of p97 and p670 promoters showed significant elevation in SCC compared to normal samples. Only 4.2% showed genomic variations of HPV16 E1 63-bp duplication. Conclusion: E1 may play a role in cancer development. The detection of E1 mRNA and promoter methylation may be useful as cancer prognostic markers."
"Formation and characterization of BC and BC-paper pulp films for packaging application  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.It was found beneficial to manufacture bacterial cellulose (BC) obtained from waste food sources to create value-added packaging products by firstly performing purification and disintegration processing of the BC and then reinforcing it with paper pulp. The purification treatment involved using sodium hydroxide (2% w/v at 100°C for 1 h) on BC pulp to remove the bacterial protein and the resulting cultured medium film was characterized with respect to its physical properties. An acid treatment on the purified BC pulp was applied to disintegrate cellulose network before forming a film. The results showed that the sodium hydroxide treatment increased the film burst index and brightness. Heating the BC pulp to 70–100°C in 1.25–5.00% v/v sulfuric acid treatment for 30 min degraded the film’s mechanical properties. Also, a study of the addition and mixing of paper pulps or modified cationic starch to the BC was found to improve the film properties with respect to packaging properties. Inclusion of short fiber paper pulp by 30 wt.% created a good synergistic effect by improving the mechanical properties of film especially for tear strength. Moreover, cationic-modified cassava starch (2% w/w) improved the tensile and burst index as well as resistance to oxygen permeation of the BC film. The results indicate that the BC pulp could be used to improve mechanical properties and resistance to water vapor and oxygen permeation of the short fiber paper pulp film which is ideal for packaging materials."
"Valproic acid attenuates nitric oxide and interleukin-1β production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated iron-rich microglia  Spandidos Publications 2017. All rights reserved.Iron accumulation in activated microglia has been consistently reported in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous results suggest that these cells facilitate neuroinflammation leading to neuronal cell death. Therefore, chemical compounds that alleviate the activation of iron-rich microglia may result in neuroprotection. In the present study, the effect of valproic acid (VPA) on microglial activation under iron-rich conditions was investigated. BV-2 microglial cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml) and iron (300 μg/ml) with or without VPA (1.6 mM). The results demonstrated that VPA attenuated the activation of iron-rich BV2 cells induced by LPS by down-regulating the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase and interleukin 1β (IL-1β; P<0.01), to ultimately reduce the production of NO and IL-1β (P<0.01). These events were accompanied by an attenuation in the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 subunit (P<0.01). These findings suggest that VPA may be therapeutically useful for attenuating the activation of iron-rich microglia."
"Can therapeutic Thai massage improve upper limb muscle strength in Parkinson's disease? An objective randomized-controlled trial  2018 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan UniversityMuscle weakness is a frequent complaint amongst Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, evidence-based therapeutic options for this symptom are limited. We objectively measure the efficacy of therapeutic Thai massage (TTM) on upper limb muscle strength, using an isokinetic dynamometer. A total of 60 PD patients with muscle weakness that is not related to their ‘off’ periods or other neurological causes were equally randomized to TTM intervention (n = 30), consisting of six TTM sessions over a 3-week period, or standard medical care (no intervention, n = 30). Primary outcomes included peak extension and flexion torques. Scale-based outcomes, including Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and visual analogue scale for pain (VAS) were also performed. From baseline to end of treatment, patients in the intervention group showed significant improvement on primary objective outcomes, including peak flexion torque (F = 30.613, p <.001) and peak extension torque (F = 35.569, p <.001) and time to maximal flexion speed (F = 14.216, p =.001). Scale-based assessments mirrored improvements in the objective outcomes with a significant improvement from baseline to end of treatment of the UPDRS-bradykinesia of a more affected upper limb (F = 9.239, p =.005), and VAS (F = 69.864, p <.001) following the TTM intervention, compared to the control group. No patients reported adverse events in association with TTM. Our findings provide objective evidence that TTM used in combination with standard medical therapies is effective in improving upper limb muscle strength in patients with PD. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of TTM on other motor and non-motor symptoms in PD."
"Elastic layer under axisymmetric indentation and surface energy effects  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.In this paper, a continuum-based approach is adopted to investigate the contact problem of an elastic layer with finite thickness and rigid base subjected to axisymmetric indentation with the consideration of surface energy effects. A complete Gurtin–Murdoch surface elasticity is employed to consider the influence of surface stresses. The indentation problem of a rigid frictionless punch with arbitrary axisymmetric profiles is formulated by employing the displacement Green’s functions, derived with the aid of Hankel integral transform technique. The problem is solved by assuming the contact pressure distribution in terms of a linear combination of admissible functions and undetermined coefficients. Those coefficients are then obtained by employing a collocation technique and an efficient numerical quadrature scheme. The accuracy of proposed solution technique is verified by comparing with existing solutions for rigid indentation on an elastic half-space. Selected numerical results for the indenters with flat-ended cylindrical and paraboloidal punch profiles are presented to portray the influence of surface energy effects on elastic fields of the finite layer. It is found that the presence of surface stresses renders the layer stiffer, and the size-dependent behavior of elastic fields is observed in the present solutions. In addition, the surface energy effects become more pronounced with smaller contact area; thus, the influence of surface energy cannot be ignored in the analysis of indentation problem especially when the indenter size is very small such as in the case of nanoindentation."
"The Blomia tropicalis allergen Blo t 7 stimulates innate immune signalling pathways through TLR2  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Although the house dust mite species Blomia tropicalis is a leading cause of allergic diseases in tropical and subtropical regions, the identification and characterization of the allergenic proteins remain incomplete. Objective: We aimed to characterize a recombinant form of Blo t 7 (rBlo t 7) in terms of IgE reactivity, lipid-binding activity and ability to stimulate innate immunity. Methods: The mature Blo t 7 cDNA was cloned by PCR methods for the expression of a secreted form of the allergen in P. pastoris. The IgE reactivity to purified rBlo t 7 as well as the potential cross-reactivity with Der p 7 was determined by ELISA. The lipid-binding capacity of rBlo t 7 was assayed using fluorescent lipid probes. The stimulation of TLR2 signalling pathway by rBlo t 7 was examined in cell activation and reporter assays. Results: The amplified mature Blo t 7 cDNA revealed the presence of a 60 base pair insertion compared with the reference sequence registered in the GenBank database. Multiple protein sequence alignments of group 7 mite allergens confirmed that this longer deduced amino acid sequence was the authentic Blo t 7 polypeptide chain. Analysis of IgE reactivity can classify rBlo t 7 as an intermediate B. tropicalis allergen which displayed weak cross-reactivity with Der p 7. Purified rBlo t 7 was shown to bind selectively the naturally fluorescent lipid probe cis-parinaric (cPNA) with a dissociation constant of 2 μmol/L. The group 7 Blomia allergen stimulated the TLR2-, NF-kB- and MAPK-dependent production of IL-8 and GM-CSF in respiratory epithelial cells. Conclusions & Clinical Relevance: Through its propensity to transport fatty acids/lipids and to stimulate TLR2 signalling pathways in airway epithelial cells, Blo t 7 can represent a key allergen for the initiation of the B. tropicalis-induced airway inflammation."
"A novel patterning method for three-dimensional paper-based devices by using inkjet-printed water mask  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.Paper-based devices are continuing to grow rapidly. However, conventional paper patterning methods are mostly restricted to the fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) patterns. Here, we present a novel patterning method for the fabrication of 2D and 3D paper-based devices. For the first time, a 3D fluidic channel network with multiple crossings of fluidic channels is successfully fabricated on a layer of paper without sophisticated procedures. The proposed method utilizes a commercially available inkjet printer to print water pattern as a protective mask onto both sides of a paper substrate and followed by soaking the sample into a non-polar solution which contains a hydrophobic substance to form hydrophobic barriers on the paper substrate. The printed water mask helps preventing the adsorption of the non-polar solution into the printed water area resulting in the formation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas. This opens up a new route towards the development of 2D and 3D paper-based devices using low-cost equipment and a variety of materials."
"CONTINUITY on GENERALISED TOPOLOGICAL SPACES VIA HEREDITARY CLASSES  2018 Australian Mathematical Publishing Association Inc.A generalised topology is a collection of subsets of a given nonempty set containing the empty set and arbitrary unions of the elements in the collection.

We study continuity on generalised topological spaces via hereditary classes in various situations."
"Twin InSb/GaAs quantum nano-stripes: Growth optimization and related properties  2018 Elsevier B.V.Growth of InSb/GaAs quantum nanostructures on GaAs substrate by using molecular beam epitaxy with low growth temperature and slow growth rate typically results in a mixture of isolated and paired nano-stripe structures, which are termed as single and twin nano-stripes, respectively. In this work, we investigate the growth conditions to maximize the number ratio between twin and single nano-stripes. The highest percentage of the twin nano-stripes of up to 59% was achieved by optimizing the substrate temperature and the nano-stripe growth rate. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the substantial size and height reduction of the buried nano-stripes. We also observed the Raman shift and photon emission from our twin nano-stripes. These twin nano-stripes are promising for spintronics and quantum computing devices."
"Joint Management of an Interconnected Coastal Aquifer and Invasive Tree  2017 Elsevier B.V.Kiawe (Prosopis pallida), a mesquite tree considered invasive in many parts of the world including Hawai'i, has been shown to reduce regional groundwater levels via deep taproots. In areas where aquifers are primary sources of fresh water, kiawe control has the potential to be an integral component of water management planning. We develop an analytical dynamic framework for the joint management of kiawe and groundwater, and show that optimal water management depends on expected kiawe damages, while optimal kiawe removal depends on groundwater scarcity and removal cost. Using data from the Kīholo aquifer on the west coast of Hawai'i Island, we solve for joint management decisions with corresponding parameters related to kiawe damage and water scarcity. With 1.5% water demand growth, Kiawe should be removed if the removal cost is below $1884/ha. Our numerical results indicate that kiawe damage is nonlinear in the rate of water demand growth. The damage costs can be attributed to three main factors. When demand growth is low, kiawe damage is driven by a higher water extraction cost. For moderate growth, the effect is compounded by anticipated future scarcity. Damage is amplified by a backstop cost effect when the growth rate is high."
"Transformation of heavy metal fractionation under changing environments: a case study of a drainage system in an e-waste dismantling community  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The change in environmental conditions during the transportation of contaminated soil and sediment was expected to affect the transformation of heavy metal fractionation. This study disclosed the serious contamination of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in the sewer sediment of an e-waste dismantling community in Thailand which may be caused by flushed contaminated soil and e-waste fragments. Two environmental conditions were simulated to observe the transformation of heavy metal fractionation. The anoxic sewer condition was induced using high substrate and sulfate in a closed container. The aeration of anoxic contaminated sediment was applied to simulate the transformation to an oxidative environment. The BCR sequential extraction was applied for heavy metal fractionation in this study. The study results exhibited that when heavy metal contaminated soil was transferred into this induced anoxic condition, fractionation was redistributed based on the chemical change of system that tends to be associated into F3 (oxidizable fraction) > F2 (reducible fraction) > F1 (acid soluble/exchangeable fraction). Cu exhibited the outstanding capability association to F3. The iron sulfide was not observed as usual due to its lower capability than Cu, Pb, and Zn. When contaminated sediment was transported to a more oxidative environment, the heavy metals fractionation would be redistributed again among those new environment media. It is noteworthy that F3 of Cu was stable even in oxic conditions. F2 of Fe was not developed by this oxic condition, possibly because its dehydration process was limited. The redistribution under an oxic environment became F1 > F2 > F3 indicating their more available form. This transformation was imperative and should be taken into account in heavy metal contaminated site management and control."
"Training using a new multidirectional reach tool improves balance in individuals with stroke Copyright  2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Background and purpose: Previous studies suggested that limits of stability (LOS) training with visual feedback using commercial equipment could be used to improve balance ability in individuals with stroke. However, this system is expensive. In this study, we created a new tool from inexpensive elements based on LOS training using visual feedback. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of training using a new multidirectional reach tool on balance in individuals with stroke. Methods: A single-blind randomized control trial was conducted. Individuals with stroke (n = 16; age range 38–72 years) were recruited. Participants in the experimental group were trained with the multidirectional reach training for 30 min and conventional physical therapy for 30 min per day, 3 days a week for 4 weeks. Participants in the control group received conventional physical therapy for 30 min per day, 3 days a week for 4 weeks. The outcomes were LOS, weight-bearing squat, and Fullerton Advanced Balance scale. All of the outcome measures were measured at pretraining, post-training, and 1 month follow-up. Results: At post-training and 1-month follow-up, the participants in the experimental group had an improvement of dynamic balance than the control group. Furthermore, the activity assessment by Fullerton Advanced Balance scale was more improved at 1 month follow-up in the experimental group than control group. Conclusion: The results of this study provide evidence that training using a new multidirectional reach tool is effective for improving balance in individuals with stroke."
"Generalized T-stress solutions for penny-shaped cracks in transversely isotropic piezoelectric media  2018 Elsevier LtdA novel set of analytical and semi-analytical solutions is obtained for the generalized T-stress for both electrically impermeable and permeable penny-shaped cracks embedded in a transversely isotropic, linear piezoelectric, infinite medium under uniform far-field loading and general mechanical and electrical crack-face loading. The generalized stress field of the crack for two basic loading cases, viz. uniformly distributed self-equilibrated crack-face loading and a pair of crack-face self-equilibrated unit normal point forces and unit point electrical charges, are employed together with the asymptotic near-front expansion to establish fundamental solutions for the generalized T-stress. Such fundamental solutions are explicit and involve only elementary functions, and are then utilized to form an explicit integral formula for computing the generalized T-stress of a penny-shaped crack under general crack-face loading. The exact integration of the integral formula is also established for specific loading conditions, whereas its evaluation via an efficient quadrature for general loading conditions is also addressed. A selected set of numerical results is presented to verify the proposed quadrature and significant and useful findings are also reported."
"Efficacy of MAS063DP lotion vs 0.02% triamcinolone acetonide lotion in improving post-ablative fractional CO2 laser resurfacing wound healing: a split-face, triple-blinded, randomized, controlled trial  2018 The International Society of DermatologyProven as effective acne scar treatment, ablative fractional carbon dioxide (AFCO2) laser requires post-laser wound healing care. MAS063DP is a multicomponent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory moisturizer for effective post-laser treatment. This study compares the efficacy of MAS063DP and 0.02% triamcinolone acetonide (TA) lotion for post-laser wound healing and complications. A split-face, triple-blinded, clinical study was performed in 16 patients, aged 20–50 years, receiving AFCO2 on both sides of the face, with MAS063DP on one side and 0.02% TA on the other side for 7 days twice daily. Digital photography, hemoglobin, and melanin index at baseline were obtained immediately after laser treatment and then at days 3, 5, 7, and 30. Erythema, edema, crusting, adverse effects, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) were followed every visit. Sixteen patients, mean age 38.6 (8.4) years, with moderate–severe atrophic scar and skin phototype III–IV completed the study. Clinical improvement of edema, erythema, crusting, and hyperpigmentation was observed from day 3 to day 30 (P < 0.001), with no statistically significant difference in both groups. There was also no statistical difference of hemoglobin, melanin index, and texture at days 3, 5, 7, and 30. Melanin index at day 30 was significantly less than baseline in both MAS063DP and 0.02% TA. With PIH in 50% of cases, both treatments demonstrated good safety profiles and no serious adverse reactions. MAS063DP could be an effective treatment for post-laser wound healing and complications, compatible to 0.02% TA."
"Perceptions of authority in a massive open online course: An intercultural study  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature, and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.Spurred on by rapid advances of technology, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have proliferated over the past decade. They pride themselves on making (higher) education available to more people at reduced (or no) cost compared to traditional university schemes and on being inclusive in terms of admitting vast numbers of students from all over the world. However, MOOCs tend to be tacitly based on the course designers’ lifeworlds, which results in the sidelining of participants whose lifeworlds are different. The authors of this article highlight culture as an important but often overlooked aspect in the research on, and the design and running of MOOCs. They begin with a review of the role of culture in MOOCs research and find that it has been somewhat ignored. Next, they present a methodological framework – the culture contrast method – with which to approach the decisive role culture plays in MOOCs. Third, coming from differing cultural backgrounds, they apply the culture contrast method in a case study, contrasting experiences, interpretations and perceptions of a particular MOOC. Their varying perceptions of how, when and why they experienced a presence of authority emerge as a consistent theme in their data. Through the analysis of their data, they distinguish between the MOOC as an assemblage, consisting of the online interface, the design and hardware they inhabit as course participants, and their respective lifeworlds as their local and situated different cultures. They argue that during the run of the course, lifeworld and assemblage collide and enact a cultural authority. This authority sets the benchmark for what is deemed proper practice within a particular MOOC and it gives preferential treatment to some participants rather than others, thus actually undermining the professed inclusiveness of the MOOC format."
"Anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of new bibenzyl derivatives from Dendrobium parishii in hydrogen peroxide and lipopolysaccharide treated RAW264.7 cells  2018 Phytochemical Society of EuropeOxidative stress and inflammatory responses are the main causes of various diseases and disorders. To prevent these incidents, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents are needed. Dendrobium parishii, known in Thai as “Ueang Khrang Sai San” was studied for chemical constituents by solvent extraction, followed by column chromatography. Seven compounds including two new (1–2) and five known compounds (3–7) were isolated and screened for antioxidant activity using DPPH, ORAC and deoxyribose assays. The new compound (compound 2) showed the highest antioxidant activities and was further evaluated for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as mechanisms of action in RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells under oxidative stress and inflammation induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. Compound 2 at 12.5, 25 and 50 μg/mL significantly decreased ROS in H2O2 treated RAW264.7 cells in a dose dependent manner and enhanced antioxidant enzyme (SOD, GPx and CAT) activities. For the anti-inflammatory activity, compound 2 reduced the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS treated RAW264.7 cells. The results indicate that compound 2 has the potential to be developed as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent."
"The immunopathogenic and immunomodulatory effects of interleukin-12 in periodontal disease  2018 Eur J Oral SciInterleukin 12 (IL-12) is an inflammatory cytokine that promotes the response of the immune system. This cytokine has been implicated as a potent stimulator of several diseases characterized by inflammatory-induced bone destruction, such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. Yet, the exact role of IL-12 in the development and progress of periodontitis has not been clarified. Several studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between the level of IL-12 and the severity of periodontal destruction. Deletion of IL-12 in mice with periodontitis significantly suppressed the level of bone destruction. Interestingly, next to a role in modulating the pathogenesis, IL-12 also has immunological-regulatory properties. This cytokine induces expression of immunosuppressive molecules, such as indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Thus, these findings suggest both negative and positive influences of IL-12 in periodontal disease. It is currently proposed that the diversity of action of cytokines is a molecular key which regulates biological development and homeostasis. Accordingly, the actions of IL-12 might be one of the mechanisms that regulate homeostasis of periodontal tissue during and following inflammation. Therefore, this article aims to review both destructive and protective functionalities of IL-12 with an emphasis on periodontal disease."
"Lingual tonsillectomy with palatal surgery for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate effects of lingual tonsillectomy with palatal surgery as a combined procedure for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults. Search methods: Data source: a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was performed through November 2017. Manual searches and subject matter expert input were also obtained. This review includes studies assessing efficacy of lingual tonsillectomy with palatal surgery as a combined procedure for the treatment of OSA in adults, who had multilevel obstruction including lingual tonsil hypertrophy, in which apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) were reported. Results: A total of four studies (107 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Pooled random effects analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of polysomnographic respiratory events postoperatively, with average AHI reduction of 18.51 events per hour, [95% confidence interval (CI) (− 31.72, − 5.31); P = 0.006] and increase in minimal arterial oxygen saturation of 5.26 [95% CI (0.10, 10.42); P = 0.05]. The result also showed that the procedures significantly improved sleepiness resulting in an average Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) reduction of 5.44 [95% CI (− 8.69, − 2.18); P = 0.001]. Conclusion: A combination of lingual tonsillectomy with palatal surgery may offer benefits in a selected group of OSA adults, in terms of apnea/hypopnea index, minimal arterial oxygen saturation and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Data were based on meta-analysis of all case series with 2–6 months’ follow-up."
"A synergistic combination of Phyllanthus emblica and Alpinia galanga against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in human ECV304 cells  2018 Elsevier LtdA combination of ethanolic extract of Phyllanthus emblica fruits and ethanolic extract of Alpinia galanga rhizomes at a ratio of 7:3 (PE–AE (7:3)) exhibited synergistic antioxidant activities against DPPH[rad], ABTS[rad]+, and superoxide anion (O2[rad]−) radicals with Combination Indices (CIs) of 0.692 ± 0.048, 0.802 ± 0.033, and 0.840 ± 0.023, respectively. At concentrations of 20 and 50 µg/mL, the PE–AE (7:3) showed a significant decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in an endothelial cell line (ECV304) in dose-dependent manner, as well as an increase in cell survival. In addition, The PE–AE (7:3) at 50 µg/mL was as potent as quercetin at 10 µg/mL in the inhibition of H2O2-induced lipid peroxidation. The combinations of ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamic derivatives which attributed to synergistic antiradicals enhanced cytoprotective activity. This first report on synergistic combination of PE and AE has the potential to develop as new nutritional antioxidants."
"Combination of serum histidine-rich glycoprotein and uterine artery Doppler to predict preeclampsia article  2018 The Japanese Society of Hypertension.The primary aim of this study is to determine the value of using a combination of serum histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) level and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) in pregnant women at 11-13+6 weeks' gestation to predict preeclampsia. The secondary aim is to determine the association between other pregnancy complications with the use of these combined tests. Transabdominal uterine artery PI and serum HRG level were measured at the time of first-trimester aneuploidy screening at 11-13+6 weeks' gestation in 327 pregnant women. The primary outcome was preeclampsia. The predictive values of this combination test were calculated. Eighteen cases developed preeclampsia (5.5%) and four of these preeclamptic cases were early-onset preeclampsia (1.2%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of uterine artery PI combined with serum HRG level to predict preeclampsia were 11.1%, 96.8%, 16.7%, and 94.9%, respectively. For the prediction of early-onset preeclampsia, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 25%, 97.1%, 10%, and 99%, respectively. An abnormal uterine artery PI and abnormal serum HRG level were associated with preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Our findings reveal that the combination of uterine artery PI and serum HRG level at 11-13+6 weeks of gestation is not an effective method for predicting preeclampsia at the time of first-trimester screening."
"Defining spasticity: a new approach considering current movement disorders terminology and botulinum toxin therapy  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Spasticity is a symptom occurring in many neurological conditions including stroke, multiple sclerosis, hypoxic brain damage, traumatic brain injury, tumours and heredodegenerative diseases. It affects large numbers of patients and may cause major disability. So far, spasticity has merely been described as part of the upper motor neurone syndrome or defined in a narrowed neurophysiological sense. This consensus organised by IAB—Interdisciplinary Working Group Movement Disorders wants to provide a brief and practical new definition of spasticity—for the first time—based on its various forms of muscle hyperactivity as described in the current movement disorders terminology. We propose the following new definition system: Spasticity describes involuntary muscle hyperactivity in the presence of central paresis. The involuntary muscle hyperactivity can consist of various forms of muscle hyperactivity: spasticity sensu strictu describes involuntary muscle hyperactivity triggered by rapid passive joint movements, rigidity involuntary muscle hyperactivity triggered by slow passive joint movements, dystonia spontaneous involuntary muscle hyperactivity and spasms complex involuntary movements usually triggered by sensory or acoustic stimuli. Spasticity can be described by a documentation system grouped along clinical picture (axis 1), aetiology (axis 2), localisation (axis 3) and additional central nervous system deficits (axis 4). Our new definition allows distinction of spasticity components accessible to BT therapy and those inaccessible. The documentation sheet presented provides essential information for planning of BT therapy."
"Characterization of a bioactive Jagged1-coated polycaprolactone-based membrane for guided tissue regeneration  2018 Elsevier LtdObjective: The aim of the present study was to develop a Jagged1-coated polycaprolactone (PCL) membrane and to evaluate the response of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDL) on this membrane in vitro. Methods: Membranes were prepared from PCL and PCL-incorporated hydroxyapatite (PCL/HA). The membranes’ surface roughness, surface wettability, and mechanical properties were examined. An indirect affinity immobilization technique was used to coat the membranes with Jagged1. Membrane cytotoxicity was evaluated using LIVE/DEAD and MTT assays. The morphology of the cells on the membranes was observed using scanning electron microscopy. hPDL alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymatic activity and mineral deposition were examined using an ALP assay and Alizarin Red S staining, respectively. Notch target gene mRNA expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The PCL/HA membranes exhibited a significantly reduced surface contact angle, decreased maximum tensile strain, and ultimate tensile stress. However, the surface roughness parameters were significantly increased. The PCL and PCL/HA membranes were not cytotoxic to hPDL in vitro. hPDLs attached and spread on both membrane types. Further, indirect affinity immobilized Jagged1 on the membranes upregulated hPDL Notch target gene expression. After culturing in osteogenic medium, Jagged1-immobilized PCL/HA membranes significantly enhanced hPDL ALP enzymatic activity. Conclusion: Indirect immobilized Jagged1 PCL/HA membranes could be further developed as an alternative guided tissue regeneration membrane to promote osteogenic differentiation in periodontal defects."
"Antibacterial cotton fabrics based on hydrophilic amino-containing scaffolds  2018 Elsevier B.V.A hydrophilic amino compound, 4,7,10-trioxatridecane-1,13-diamine, has been utilized in several chemical and biochemical studies. Among previous applications is its use as a flexible and economical spacer molecule to increase the length between two moieties of interest, one of which may be a solid-phase interface. In this study, we immobilized this molecule on cotton fabrics and showed that this modified surface (DA) exhibited significant antibacterial activities in both Gram-negative bacteria and a Gram-positive bacterium. Studies on the structure-activity relationship revealed that additional chemical modifications on DA usually led to lowered antibacterial activities, emphasizing an importance of having free amino groups. Further investigation by fluorescence microscope indicated that this modified surface likely interfered with the membrane integrity of bacteria, leading to cell lysis. In addition, this scaffold was also tested for its biocompatibility with mouse fibroblast cells, and exerted no detrimental effect to the cell growth, highlighting its potential as a practical antibacterial surface modifier."
RNA sequencing data of Notch ligand treated human dental pulp cells  2018 The AuthorsIndirect immobilized ligand has been shown as an effective technique to activate Notch signalling in vitro. The data presented in this article are related to the published article entitled “Indirect immobilized Jagged1 suppresses cell cycle progression and induces odonto/osteogenic differentiation in human dental pulp cells” (Manokawinchoke et al. 2017) [1]. This data article describes gene expression in indirect immobilized Jagged1 treated human dental pulp cells (hDPs) using high throughput RNA sequencing technique. These data are valuable to analyze the regulation of Notch signalling in hDPs for understanding its molecular mechanism(s). Raw RNA sequencing data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRP100068) and NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE94989).
"Corticosteroid nasal irrigations are more effective than simple sprays in a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial for chronic rhinosinusitis after sinus surgery  2018 ARS-AAOA, LLCBackground: Persistent mucosal inflammation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) often results in ongoing symptoms, recurrence of polypoid mucosa, infective exacerbations, and further systemic medication despite surgical intervention. Debate exists as to the most effective topical therapy in CRS. Methods: The objective was to determine if corticosteroid delivered via a nasal irrigation or via a simple nasal spray would be more effective in controlling the symptoms and signs of CRS. A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial over 12 months was performed between 3 tertiary rhinologic clinics. After sinus surgery, all patients performed a nasal irrigation followed by a nasal spray once a day for 12 months. Groups were defined by corticosteroid (2 mg mometasone) delivered by either spray or irrigation. The primary outcomes were patient-reported symptoms: visual analogue score (VAS) and 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22), a global rating of sinonasal function. Secondary outcomes were also recorded from radiology (Lund-Mackay score [LMS]) and endoscopic (Modified Lund-Kennedy score [mLKS]) assessments. Results: A total of 44 patients were randomized (age 50.3 ± 13.0 years; 40.9% female). Overall, patients improved significantly from either intervention. However, the corticosteroid nasal irrigation group had greater improvement in nasal blockage (−69.91 ± 29.37 vs −36.12 ± 42.94; p = 0.029), a greater improvement on LMS (−12.07 ± 4.43 vs −7.39 ± 6.94; p = 0.031) and less inflammation on mLKS at 12 months (7.33 ± 11.55 vs 21.78 ± 23.37; p = 0.018). One-year posttreatment blockage, drainage, fever, and total VAS scores were all lower in the corticosteroid irrigation group. Conclusion: In the setting of diffuse or patchy CRS disease, the use of corticosteroid delivered by nasal irrigation is superior to simple nasal spray in postsurgical patients."
"Prognostic factors affecting outcomes in patients with malignant GI bleeding treated with a novel endoscopically delivered hemostatic powder  2018 American Society for Gastrointestinal EndoscopyBackground and Aims: Endoscopic hemostatic techniques remain poorly effective for GI tumor bleeding. We assessed Tc-325 (Hemospray, Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind, USA) for this indication and determined possible predictors of decreased recurrent bleeding and improved 6-month survival in affected patients. Methods: This retrospective study identified 99 patients with active malignant GI bleeding (primary or metastatic) treated with Tc-325. Eleven patients were excluded because of incomplete data. Data on patient characteristics and possible predictive factors of early (72-hour) and delayed (7-, 14-, and 30-day) recurrent bleeding, as well as 6-month survival, were collected. Results: Overall, 70.5% were male (age, 65 ± 14 years). Half had a high Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score (3 or 4). An upper GI cancer was found in 56.8%, and 72.7% cancers were stage 4. Of those affected, 51.6% received at least 1 non-endoscopic additional definitive hemostatic treatment after Tc-325. Immediate hemostasis with Tc-325 was 97.7%, with recurrent bleeding noted in 15% (early) and 17% (delayed). Six-month survival was 53.4%. On multivariable analysis, no predictive factor for recurrent bleeding was identified, whereas ECOG score 0 to 2 (P =.001; hazard ratio [HR], 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.47), cancer stage 1 to 3 (P =.04; HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.96), and receiving definite hemostatic treatment alone or in any combination with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or radiologic embolization (P =.002; HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.59) were significant prognosticators of 6-month survival after adjusting for comorbidity, type of cancer bleeding, and presence of a coagulopathy. Conclusion: Before definitive therapy can be offered, Tc-325 provides effective initial hemostasis of tumoral GI bleeding. Good performance status, non-end-stage cancer, and receiving definite hemostatic treatment are independent predictors of 6-month survival. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT03066700.)"
"In Schizophrenia, Depression, Anxiety, and Physiosomatic Symptoms Are Strongly Related to Psychotic Symptoms and Excitation, Impairments in Episodic Memory, and Increased Production of Neurotoxic Tryptophan Catabolites: a Multivariate and Machine Learning Study  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The depression, anxiety and physiosomatic symptoms (DAPS) of schizophrenia are associated with negative symptoms and changes in tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) patterning. The aim of this study is to delineate the associations between DAPS and psychosis, hostility, excitation, and mannerism (PHEM) symptoms, cognitive tests as measured using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) and IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs. We included 40 healthy controls and 80 participants with schizophrenia. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured with The Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scales, respectively. Physiosomatic symptoms were assessed with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale (FF). Negative symptoms as well as CERAD tests, including Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Word List Memory (WLM), and WL Delayed Recall were measured, while ratios of IgA responses to noxious/protective TRYCATs (IgA NOX_PRO) were computed. Schizophrenia symptoms consisted of two dimensions, a first comprising PHEM and negative symptoms, and a second DAPS symptoms. A large part of the variance in DAPS was explained by psychotic symptoms and WLM. Of the variance in HAM-D, 58.9% was explained by the regression on excitement, IgA NOX_PRO ratio, WLM, and VFT; 29.9% of the variance in HAM-A by psychotic symptoms and IgA NOX/PRO; and 45.5% of the variance in FF score by psychotic symptoms, IgA NOX/PRO, and WLM. Neural network modeling shows that PHEM, IgA NOX_PRO, WLM, and MMSE are the dominant variables predicting DAPS. DAPS appear to be driven by PHEM and negative symptoms coupled with impairments in episodic memory, especially false memory creation, while all symptom dimension and cognitive impairments may be driven by an increased production of noxious TRYCATs, including picolinic, quinolinic, and xanthurenic acid."
"Add-on Treatment with Curcumin Has Antidepressive Effects in Thai Patients with Major Depression: Results of a Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Activation of immune-inflammatory and oxidative-nitrosative (IO&NS) stress pathways plays a role in major depression (MDD). Evidence suggests that curcumin (500–1000 mg/day), a polyphenol with strong anti-IO&NS properties, may have efficacy either as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment for depression. Further controlled trials with extended treatment periods (> 8 weeks) and higher curcumin doses are warranted. This 12-week study was carried out to examine the effects of adjunctive curcumin for the treatment of MDD. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 65 participants with MDD were randomized to receive either adjunctive curcumin (increasing dose from 500 to 1500 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Four weeks after the active treatment phase, a follow-up visit was conducted at week 16. Assessments of the primary, i.e., the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and secondary, i.e., the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), outcome measures were rated at baseline and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks later. Curcumin was more efficacious than placebo in improving MADRS scores with significant differences between curcumin and placebo emerging at weeks 12 and 16. The effects of curcumin were more pronounced in males compared to females. There were no statistically significant treatment-emerging adverse effects and no significant effects of curcumin on blood chemistry and ECG measurements. Adjunctive curcumin has significant antidepressant effects in participants with MDD as evidenced by significant benefits occurring 12 and 16 weeks after treatment initiation. Curcumin administration was safe and well-tolerated even when combined with antidepressants. Future trials should include treatment-by-sex interactions to examine putative antidepressant effects of immune-modifying compounds."
"Association between secondhand smoke exposure and quality of life in pregnant women and postpartum women and the consequences on the newborns  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is prevalent and could damage the health of non-smokers, especially that of pregnant women (PW) and postpartum women (PPW). Nevertheless, there is no study on the impact of SHS during pregnancy on the quality of life (QOL) of PW and PPW. The study’s purpose is to study the effects of exposure to SHS on the QOL of pregnant and postpartum women and health of the newborns. Methods: Self-reports and urine tests for cotinine were used to obtain data on SSH exposure in 296 women in the second trimester of pregnancy and 106 women in the postpartum period at the Obstetrics & Gynecology Clinic located in a university hospital. The WHOQOL-BREF-THAI and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale were used to assess QOL and postpartum depression, respectively. Results: Of the participants, 88.2% of PW and 62.3% of PPW reported exposure to SHS during pregnancy. Of the PPW, 5.7% had postpartum depression. PW with good QOL were less likely to have family member who smoked (p = 0.007) or to be exposed to SHS in public parks (p = 0.037) or in the household or workplace (p = 0.011). Likewise, PPW with good QOL in the psychological domain were less likely to be exposed to SHS during pregnancy, as shown in both verbal report (p = 0.010) and objective measure of urine cotinine test (p = 0.034). In addition, maternal exposure to SHS during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight and other health problems in the newborns (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Exposure to SHS during pregnancy is associated with a lower QOL and a poorer health condition in the newborns."
"Treponema denticola increases MMP-2 expression and activation in the periodontium via reversible DNA and histone modifications  2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdHost-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and bacterial proteases mediate destruction of extracellular matrices and supporting alveolar bone in periodontitis. The Treponema denticola dentilisin protease induces MMP-2 expression and activation in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells, and dentilisin-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2 is required for cellular fibronectin degradation. Here, we report that T. denticola regulates MMP-2 expression through epigenetic modifications in the periodontium. PDL cells were treated with epigenetic enzyme inhibitors before or after T. denticola challenge. Fibronectin fragmentation, MMP-2 expression, and activation were assessed by immunoblot, zymography, and qRT-PCR, respectively. Chromatin modification enzyme expression in T. denticola-challenged PDL cells and periodontal tissues were evaluated using gene arrays. Several classes of epigenetic enzymes showed significant alterations in transcription in diseased tissue and T. denticola-challenged PDL cells. T. denticola-mediated MMP-2 expression and activation were significantly reduced in PDL cells treated with inhibitors of aurora kinases and histone deacetylases. In contrast, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors had little effect, and inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases, methyltransferases, and demethylases exacerbated T. denticola-mediated MMP-2 expression and activation. Chronic epigenetic changes in periodontal tissues mediated by T. denticola or other oral microbes may contribute to the limited success of conventional treatment of chronic periodontitis and may be amenable to therapeutic reversal."
"Utilization of microalgae feedstock for concomitant production of bioethanol and biodiesel  2018 Elsevier LtdThe present study focuses on the biorefinery approach of integrated production of bioethanol and biodiesel from microalgae feedstock. Various pretreatment methods were used to determine the maximum recovery of sugars from Scenedesmus sp. The total sugar yield of 93% was obtained when the biomass was pretreated by acid hydrolysis. The hydrolysate produced 86% of ethanol (theoretical yield) after the fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Enzyme catalyzed direct transesterification of the biomass was performed using dimethyl carbonate as a solvent and the maximum yield of 92% methyl ester, 1.86% glycerol carbonate and 4.93% glycerol dicarbonate was achieved. The integrated process of bioethanol and biodiesel production was optimally achieved when direct transesterification was done first followed by ethanol fermentation yielding 92 and 93% of methyl ester and ethanol, respectively."
"Intermittent compressive force induces human mandibular-derived osteoblast differentiation via WNT/β-catenin signaling  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Mechanical force induces an efflux of ATP that regulates osteoblast differentiation. However, the effect of mechanical force-induced ATP efflux on WNT/β-catenin signaling remains unclarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intermittent compressive force (ICF) and ICF-induced extracellular ATP on osteoblast differentiation via WNT/β-catenin signaling in human mandibular-derived osteoblast precursors (hMOBPs). The hMOBPs were subjected to ICF (1.5 g/cm2, 0.3 Hz) for 20 h. To investigate the role of ATP, Apyrase (0.5 units/mL), an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP, was added 30 min before ICF was applied. The extracellular ATP levels were measured immediately after ICF was removed. The mRNA expression of osteogenic related genes, including WNT was evaluated via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. In vitro mineralization was determined by Alizarin Red S staining. The localization of β-catenin was detected using immunofluorescence staining and lentiviral-TOP-dGFP reporter assay. The results demonstrated that ICF increased ATP efflux and in vitro mineralization by hMOBPs. In addition, OSX, ALP, and WNT3A mRNA expression and β-catenin nuclear translocation increased when ICF was applied. The upregulation of these genes was reduced by Apyrase, suggesting the role of ICF-induced ATP on osteoblast differentiation. Notably, ICF altered the mRNA expression of purinergic 2X receptors (P2XRs). A P2X1R antagonist (NF449) downregulated ICF-induced WNT3A, OSX, and ALP mRNA expression. Moreover, when 25 μM α, β-meATP, a P2X1R agonist, was added, WNT3A, and OSX expression increased. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that ICF-induced ATP enhanced hMOBP differentiation. This enhancement was associated with WNT/β-catenin signaling and P2X1R activation."
"Using hair and fingernails in binary logistic regression for bio-monitoring of heavy metals/metalloid in groundwater in intensively agricultural areas, Thailand  2017 Elsevier Inc.In this study, the hair and fingernails of the local people in an intensively cultivated agricultural area in Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand, were used as biomarkers of exposure to arsenic (As) and heavy metals. The study area has shallow acidic groundwater that is contaminated with As and heavy metals. The local people often consume this shallow groundwater; thus, they are exposed to As and heavy metals. Hair and fingernail samples were collected to characterize the differences between shallow groundwater drinking (SGWD) and tap water drinking (TWD) residents. The concentrations of As and the heavy metals Cd, Pb and Hg were significantly higher in the hair samples from the SGWD group than those from the TWD group, especially for As (0.020–0.571 vs. 0.024–0.359 µg/g) and Cd (0.009–0.575 vs. 0.013–0.230 µg/g). Similarly, the concentrations of As and the heavy metals in the fingernail samples collected from the SGWD group were larger than those of the TWD group, especially for As (0.039–2.440 µg/g vs. 0.049–0.806 µg/g). The χ2 statistic and binary logistic regression were used to find the associated factors and assess the associated probabilities. The regression results show that the factors associated with the concentrations of As and the heavy metals in the hair samples were drinking water source, rate of water consumption, gender, bathing water source, education, smoking and underlying disease, whereas the factors associated with the concentrations of these species in the fingernail samples were drinking water source, gender, occupation, work hours per day, alcohol consumption, and the use of pesticides."
"Differential gene modulation of pattern-recognition receptor TLR and RIG-I-like and downstream mediators on intestinal mucosa of pigs infected with PEDV non S-INDEL and PEDV S-INDEL strains  2017 Elsevier Inc.Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains can be divided into non-S-INDEL and S-INDEL strains. PEDV pathogenesis is strain-specific, and studies in neonatal pigs have demonstrated that the PEDV non-S-INDEL strains are more pathogenic than the PEDV S-INDEL strains. RNA viruses, including PEDV, can interact with a large number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the intestinal mucosa, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). We investigated the differential gene modulation of TLRs, RIG-I, and downstream mediators on the intestinal mucosa of neonatal pigs infected with PEDV S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL strains. Ten five-day-old piglets were inoculated orally with 10 ml of 104 TCDI50/ml of either PEDV non-S-INDEL or S-INDEL strains. PEDV S-INDEL infection induced pro-inflammatory cytokines through the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway by activating RIG-I. In contrast, PEDV non-S-INDEL infection suppressed the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production by down-regulation of TLRs and downstream signaling molecules."
"Influences of climatic parameters on piglet preweaning mortality in Thailand  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The objective of the present study was to determine the influences of temperature, humidity, and temperature–humidity index (THI) on piglet preweaning mortality in a conventional open-housing system commercial swine herd in Thailand. The analyzed data included 11,157 litters from 3574 Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred sows. The daily temperature, humidity, and THI data were collected from a meteorological station near the herd. The associations between temperature, humidity, and THI for periods before and after farrowings and piglet preweaning mortality were analyzed. Piglet preweaning mortality (log transformation) and the proportion of litters with piglet preweaning mortality greater than 20% were analyzed by using general linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models (GLIMMIX), respectively. On average, the piglet preweaning mortality and the proportion of litters with piglet preweaning mortality greater than 20% were 14.5% (14.2 to 14.8% CI) and 26.4% (25.5 to 27.2% CI), respectively. Piglet preweaning mortality was positively correlated with the mean temperature (r = 0.028, P = 0.003), humidity (r = 0.038, P < 0.001), and THI (r = 0.036, P < 0.001) during 0–7 days postpartum. In primiparous sows, piglet preweaning mortality increased from 12.1 to 18.5% (+ 6.4%, P < 0.001) when the mean temperature during 0–7 days postpartum increased from < 25.0 to ≥ 29 °C. However, the influence of the temperature during 0–7 days postpartum was insignificant in multiparous sows (P = 0.569, P = 0.593, and P = 0.539 in sows parity numbers 2, 3–5, and 6–9, respectively). Likewise, piglet preweaning mortality increased from 10.7 to 16.7% (+ 6.0%, P = 0.012) when humidity during 0–7 days postpartum increased from < 60 to ≥ 80% in primiparous sows but it was insignificant in sows parity numbers 3–5 (P = 0.095) and 6–9 (P = 0.219). Moreover, the proportion of the litters with piglet preweaning mortality greater than 20% in primiparous sows increased from 18.3 to 32.4% (+ 14.1%, P = 0.017) when the THI during 0–7 days postpartum increased from < 73 to ≥ 81. In conclusion, the negative influences of temperature, humidity, and THI on piglet preweaning mortality were more evident in primiparous than multiparous sows. These findings implied that strategies to reduce temperature for postpartum sows in the open-housing system in Thailand are inadequate, and the proper management of postpartum primiparous sows should be emphasized."
"Effects of extensive bottom cultivation of tropical oyster Crassostrea belcheri on benthic invertebrate community structure in Ban Don Bay, Suratthani Province, Southern Thailand  2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.The diversity, distribution, and species richness of benthic invertebrates were examined under extensive bottom cultivation of the tropical oyster Crassostrea belcheri during the summer of 2015 at Ban Don Bay, Suratthani Province, Southern Thailand. Oyster farms that had been operating for 25 years were selected for the study, and four sampling sites were allocated along each transect as (i) at the center of the farm, (ii) inside the farm, (iii) at the farm boundary, and (iv) a reference site. Results indicated that a total of 23 families and 28 species of benthic invertebrate taxa were recorded from the four sampling sites, and the macrobenthic invertebrates inhabiting all study sites consisted mainly of gastropods (11 species), polychaetes (11 species), and bivalves (8 species). No significant differences in total density, diversity index, evenness index, and species richness index of benthic invertebrates were found among each sampling site (P CloseSPigtSPi 0.05). Significant differences in total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, total ammonia, sulfide, total phosphorus, organic matter, and grain sizes of sediment were found among each sampling site, but no significant differences in pH and total nitrogen were found. Among the independent variables analyzed, correlation analysis showed relationships between benthic diversity indices and abiotic variables. There were no clear patterns of differences in the detrimental environmental effects between sampling site locations, which indicated a minimal ecological impact of oyster cultivation."
"A cytosolic sensor, PmDDX41, mediates antiviral immune response in black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon  2017 Elsevier LtdDEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box polypeptide 41 (DDX41), a receptor belonging to the DExD family, has recently been identified as an intracellular DNA sensor in vertebrates. Here, we report on the identification and functional characterization of PmDDX41, the first cytosolic DNA sensor in shrimp. By searching a Penaeus monodon expressed sequence tag (EST) database (http://pmonodon.biotec.or.th), three cDNA fragments exhibiting similarity to DDX41 in various species were identified and assembled, resulting in a complete open reading frame of PmDDX41 that contains 1863-bp and encodes a putative protein of 620 amino acids. PmDDX41 shares 83% and 79% similarity to DDX41 homolog from the bee Apis florea and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, respectively and contains three conserved domains in the protein: DEADc domain, HELICc domain, and zinc finger domain. The transcript of PmDDX41 was detected in all tested tissues and was up-regulated upon infection with a DNA virus, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). However, PmDDX41 mRNA expression was not significantly changed and down-regulated in response to a bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, or an RNA virus, yellow head virus (YHV), respectively, compared with the control phosphate-buffered saline-injected shrimp. Furthermore, the suppression of PmDDX41 by dsRNA-mediated gene silencing resulted in more rapid death of WSSV-infected shrimp and a significant decrease in the mRNA expression levels of several immune-related genes (PmIKKβ, PmIKKɛ, PmRelish, PmCactus, PmDorsal, PmPEN3, PmPEN5, and ALFPm6). These results suggest that PmDDX41 is involved in the antiviral response, probably via a DNA-sensing pathway that is triggered through the IκB kinase complex and leads to the activation of several immune-related genes."
"Factors influencing nurse-assessed quality nursing care: A cross-sectional study in hospitals  2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: To propose a hypothesized theoretical model and apply it to examine the structural relationships among work environment, patient-to-nurse ratio, job satisfaction, burnout, intention to leave and quality nursing care. Background: Improving quality nursing care is a first consideration in nursing management globally. A better understanding of factors influencing quality nursing care can help hospital administrators implement effective programmes to improve quality of services. Although certain bivariate correlations have been found between selected factors and quality nursing care in different study models, no studies have examined the relationships among work environment, patient-to-nurse ratio, job satisfaction, burnout, intention to leave and quality nursing care in a more comprehensive theoretical model. Design: A cross-sectional survey. Methods: The questionnaires were collected from 510 Chinese nurses in four Chinese tertiary hospitals in January 2015. The validity and internal consistency reliability of research instruments were evaluated. Structural equation modelling was used to test a theoretical model. Results: The findings revealed that the data supported the theoretical model. Work environment had a large total effect size on quality nursing care. Burnout largely and directly influenced quality nursing care, which was followed by work environment and patient-to-nurse ratio. Job satisfaction indirectly affected quality nursing care through burnout. Conclusions: This study shows how work environment past burnout and job satisfaction influences quality nursing care. Apart from nurses’ work conditions of work environment and patient-to-nurse ratio, hospital administrators should pay more attention to nurse outcomes of job satisfaction and burnout when designing intervention programmes to improve quality nursing care."
"Salicylicylphenylacetylene fluorophore mixed with graphene oxide for selective lysozyme detection  2017 Elsevier B.V.A highly selective method of lysozyme detection based on salicylicylphenylacetylene (1) fluorophores and graphene oxide (GO) was successfully developed. The fluorescent emission of 1 was decreased fivefold in the addition of GO (0.6 Abs) due to π-π and hydrophobic interaction between 1 and GO graphitic plane. In the presence of lysozyme (Lys), the non-emissive 1-GO became highly fluorescent as a result of strong interaction of 1 with the cationic Lys preventing the complexation between 1 and GO. The linear dynamic response of fluorescence intensity was observed in the Lys concentration range of 0–80 µg/mL with the limit of detection of 65 ng/mL. This label free technique was developed for quantitative determination of Lys in egg white sample with an analytical accuracy of less than 10% error."
"The effects of walking intervention in patients with chronic low back pain: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  2017 Elsevier LtdObjective The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was to gain insight into the effectiveness of walking intervention on pain, disability, and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) at post intervention and follow ups. Method Six electronic databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro and The Cochrane library) were searched from 1980 to October 2017. The following keywords were used: Walk* or Pedometer* or Accelerometer* or Treadmill* paired with “Back pain”, “Low back pain”, “Chronic low back pain”, “LBP”, or “Backache”. Randomized controlled trials in patients with chronic LBP were included if they compared the effects of walking intervention to non-pharmacological interventions. Pain, disability, and quality of life were the primary health outcomes. Results Nine studies were suitable for meta-analysis. Data was analyzed according to the duration of follow-up (short-term, < 3 months; intermediate-term, between 3 and 12 months; long-term, > 12 months). Low- to moderate-quality evidence suggests that walking intervention in patients with chronic LBP was as effective as other non-pharmacological interventions on pain and disability reduction in both short- and intermediate-term follow ups. Conclusions Unless supplementary high-quality studies provide different evidence, walking, which is easy to perform and highly accessible, can be recommended in the management of chronic LBP to reduce pain and disability."
"Enhanced electrochemical performances with a copper/xylose-based carbon composite electrode  2017 Elsevier B.V. Copper/carbon (Cu/C) composites were prepared through the simple and environmentally benign hydrothermal carbonization of xylose in the presence of Cu 2+ ions. The morphology, specific surface area, phase structure and chemical composition were investigated. Using a three-electrode system in 0.1 M H 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte, the Cu/C composite (10 wt% Cu) heat-treated at 600 °C gave the highest specific capacitance (316.2 and 350.1 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and 20 mV s -1 , respectively). The addition of Cu was the major factor in improving the electrochemical performance, enhancing the specific capacitance more than 30 times that of the C without Cu. Therefore, the Cu/C composite presented promising results in improving biomass-based C electrodes for supercapacitors."
"Silver nanoparticles-based hydrogel: Characterization of material parameters for pressure ulcer dressing applications  2017 Elsevier B.V.In the treatment of chronic wounds, pressure ulcers become a particular challenge. The principal aims of treatment are typically to prevent infection while allowing the wound to heal. This study therefore sought to prepare the hydrogel pads based on silver nanoparticles. To be effective as a wound dressing, the gel fraction, mechanical properties, and swelling capacity of the proposed material must be suitable, and it was found that PVP/alginate/chitosan in the ratio of 10:1.2:1.8 showed the required properties. Furthermore, the silver nanoparticles-based hydrogel was also found to offer antibacterial properties and an absence of cytotoxicity when tested towards human keratinocytes (HaCaT), L929 mouse fibroblasts, and human dermal fibroblasts adult (HDFa). The proposed material was then compared with commercially available dressings (ACTICOAT™ Algivon®, and Suprasorb® A + Ag) with findings showing the superiority of the proposed hydrogel in terms of reduced cost, non-cytotoxicity, and swelling, while the ability to reduce bacteria was shown to be equal to that of the commercial alternatives. Therefore, it can be concluded that silver nanoparticle-based hydrogel offers considerable potential to relieve pressure ulcers through its application as a wound dressing."
"Controlled synthesis of magnetic carbon nanoparticles via glycerol/ferrocene co-pyrolysis with magnetic induction  2017 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesWe performed a controlled synthesis of magnetic carbon nanoparticles (M-CNPs) via co-pyrolysis of glycerol and ferrocene with magnetic induction. The morphology of the synthesized M-CNPs was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis was used to analyze the carbon and Fe contents. M-CNPs that responded to magnetic stimulation were also examined with an AC-magnetic susceptibility analyzer. Our investigations on the influence of synthesis temperature in the range 700–1000 °C suggested that for an initial glycerol to ferrocene weight ratio of 3:1 and a temperature of 800 °C gave the highest yield of M-CNPs. Comparing the synthesis with and without magnetic induction, the controlled synthesis under the influence of magnetic induction shows promise as a method for producing high quality M-CNPs in high yields."
"The effects of breaks on low back pain, discomfort, and work productivity in office workers: A systematic review of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials  2017 Elsevier LtdThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of breaks on low back pain, discomfort, and work productivity in office workers. Publications were systematically searched in several databases from 1980 to December 2016. Relevant randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were retrieved and assessed for methodological quality by two independent reviewers. Quality of evidence was assessed and rated according to GRADE guidelines. Eight randomized controlled trials and three non-randomized controlled trials were included in this review, of which 10 were rated as high-quality studies. The break programs were highly heterogeneous with work duration ranging from 5 min to 2 h and break duration ranging from 20 s to 30 min. The results showed low-quality evidence for the conflicting effect of breaks on pain and low-quality evidence for the positive effect of breaks on discomfort. When stratified by type of breaks, moderate-quality evidence was found for the positive effect of active breaks with postural change for pain and discomfort. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that the use of breaks had no detrimental effect on work productivity. More high-quality studies are needed before recommendations can be given. Within a number of methodological limitations that are present in the published studies, active breaks with postural change may be effective in reducing pain in workers with acute low back pain and to prevent discomfort in healthy subjects."
"Couple of Histamine blue fluorescence chemosensor and surface charge selector of FC-modified silica nanoporous for highly specific histamine detection via FRET-process  2017 Elsevier B.V.Histamine poisoning from fish is a worldwide problem. It occurs when bacteria convert high levels of naturally occurring histidine into histamine resulting that when people eat fish containing high levels of histamine, they suffer allergic type reactions. Deeply considering, histamine and histidine consist of the primary amine and imidazole unit in their structures. As a result, the selectively discriminate detection of each species has been a greatly challenge task for determining the freshness of seafood. In the present work, the successful development of a new fluorescence sensors based on the superior Histamine blue (HB) doped in nanoporous silica (NPS) and surface modification with FC to provide FRET On-Off process and highly discriminate detection of histamine among other biogenic amines through the charge repulsion of FC and histidine and the specific reaction of mesoionic acid fluoride based Histamine blue (HB) with the amine group of Him via self-catalytic reaction of imidazole group in Him. This simple HB@NPS@FC sensory platform allows accurate determination of histamine in the linear response ranges of 29.12-166.67 μM of Him. The detection limit of the sensor was calculated equal to 8.55 μM. This HB@NPS@FC platform was investigated with success on real salmon and tuna samples. On the discovery of highly selective Him detection, the couple of two sensors and surface selector offers the potentially specific detection of Him in the field of food chemistry."
"Long-term recovery narratives following major disasters in Southeast Asia  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Most studies of major disasters focus on the impacts of the event and the short-term responses. Some evaluate the underlying causes of vulnerability, but few follow-up events years later to evaluate the consequences of early framings of the recovery process. The objective of this study was to improve understanding of the influence that recovery narratives have had on how decisions and actions are undertaken to recover from a disaster, and what influence this has had in turn, on long-term resilience. The study drew on comparisons and insights from four case studies in Southeast Asia: (1) local innovations that led to new policies for living with floods in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam following the 2001 Mekong River floods; (2) livelihood and infrastructure responses in Prey Veng, Cambodia, after the 2001 and 2011 Mekong River floods; (3) the role of the Panglima Laot, a traditional fisheries management institution, in the recovery process following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Aceh province, Indonesia; and (4) the challenges faced by small and medium enterprises in a market area following the 2011 floods in Bangkok, Thailand. This study identified alternative narratives on the purpose and means of ‘recovery’ with implications for who ultimately benefits and who remains at risk. The study also found both formal and informal loss and damage systems were involved in recoveries. The findings of this study are important for improving the performance of loss and damage systems, both existing and planned, and, ultimately, supporting more climate resilient development that is inclusive."
"Dynamic wetland mosaic environments and Asian openbill habitat creation in peri-urban Bangkok  2017, The Author(s).This study examined the spatial relationships between various types of wetland and the distribution of Asian openbills (Anastomus oscitans) as an indicator species in a peri-urban industrial area of Bangkok. We (1) mapped the study area by using a time series of aerial photographs combined with field validations, (2) conducted a 2-year line census of Asian openbills in the field, (3) interviewed local farmers and residents about Asian openbill populations and spatial distributions, and (4) conducted an overlay analysis to statistically identify land-use factors related to spatiotemporal changes in the Asian openbill population and distribution. We found that the number of ponds increased from 1980 to 1999 and then decreased from 1999 to 2010, but the remaining ponds were relatively temporally stable in their numbers and volumes. Paddy fields were primarily replaced by aquaculture ponds, and excavated soil was used as fill in adjoining built-up areas. The number of coconut, banana, mango and other trees planted around the ponds increased during the period, providing Asian openbill habitat. The openbills fed in the remaining paddy fields, and the simultaneous existence of various rice cultivation stages in the area provided a stable year-round source of food. Overall, the results indicated that this expanding urban–rural mosaic landscape could include further spatial distribution of Asian openbills in the future. This study of Asian openbills reveals just one example of the ecosystem services provided by developments creating pond–fill landscapes, and the methods used may be applicable in other similar continental delta regions."
"Histological evaluations and inflammatory responses of different dental implant abutment materials: A human histology pilot study  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Improvements of soft tissue to the abutment surface results in more stable peri-implant conditions, however, few human histological studies have compared soft tissue responses around different abutment materials. Purpose: To describe the peri-implant tissue around 3 abutment materials; titanium, zirconia, and gold alloy, over an 8-week healing period. Materials and Methods: Fifteen edentulous sites were treated with implants. Eight weeks later, peri-implant tissue was harvested and processed using a nonseparation resin embedded technique. The tissue attachment characteristics were assessed at clinical stages using the gingival index (GI) score, surgical stage (surgical score), and histological stage (histological attachment percentage). Additionally, the inflammatory responses were evaluated using inflammatory extent and inflammatory cellularity grades. Nonparametrical statistics were used to describe the GI and surgical scores, and analytical statistics were used to analyze the histological attachment percentages as well as the inflammatory extent and cellularity grades amongst the 3 groups. Results: There were no statistically significant differences among the groups for GI score (P =.071) and surgical score (P =.262). Titanium and zirconia exhibited nearly similar mean histological attachment percentages while gold alloy had a significantly lower percentage (P =.004). For the inflammatory extent and cellularity grades, the odds of being one grade higher for gold alloy abutment was 5.18 and 17.8 times that of titanium abutment, respectively. However, for the zirconia abutment, the odds were 0.87 and 7.5 times higher than the titanium group. Conclusions: The tissue around the gold alloy abutments resulted in worse attachment conditions compared with the titanium and zirconia abutments. Inflammation tended to be higher in the tissue around the gold alloy abutments than the titanium and zirconia abutments."
"Synthesis of mesoporous tin dioxide via sol-gel process assisted by resorcinol–formaldehyde gel  2017 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesTin dioxide is a useful n-type oxide semiconductor used in a variety of applications owing to its superior optical, electrical, and multifunctional properties. Here, we used a network of resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) gel to synthesize mesoporous tin dioxide via a sol–gel process. The effects of various synthesis parameters on the morphology and mesoporosity of the obtained product were investigated, including aging time of the RF gel, tin-to-formaldehyde molar ratio, resorcinol-to-carbonate molar ratio, and the aging time of the tin/RF mixed gel. Our experimental results showed that the interaction between the network of the RF gel and tin-containing sol is a key factor that affected the structural strength of the porous network and the porosity of the final product. Through control of the interactions in the tin/RF mixed gel we obtained porous tin dioxide materials that could be effectively used to form large-surface area films with desirable mesoporous properties."
"Effective biosensor based on graphene quantum dots via enzymatic reaction for directly photoluminescence detection of organophosphate pesticide  2017 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the pesticide sensor by graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and active enzyme, GQDs/enzyme platform, has been developed for monitoring the organophosphate pesticides. In this concept, H2O2 generated from the active enzymatic reaction of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (CHOx) enables to react with GQDs resulting in a “turn-off” photoluminescence of GQDs. A “turn-on” photoluminescence of GQDs at 467 nm was recovered in the presence of organophosphate. Definitely, the photoluminescence changes of GQDs/AChE/CHOx biosensor reasonably correspond to the amount of pesticide. The detection limit of GQDs/AChE/CHOx biosensor towards dichlorvos was 0.172 ppm (0.778 μM). In this approach, this biosensor offers the promising determination of the organophosphate pesticides and a benefit for easy checking of organophosphate pesticides in food, water and environment with low cost, easy-to-prepare and less toxic to environment."
"Dynamic optimal joint policies for tourism promotion and environmental restoration  2017, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK.Policies regarding tourism management can be separated into (1) tourism promotion policies and (2) environmental restoration policies. Because of the close relationship between the number of visitors and environmental quality, both policy types should be jointly designed and implemented. This paper studies the optimal use of these two policies in tourism management. In the case of Khao Laem Ya–Mu Koh Samet National Park in Thailand, the optimal policy balance requires the substantially higher restoration expenditure than the promotion expenditure at all time. With optimal policy balance, the number of visitors at the steady state increases more than twice, whereas the water quality remains unchanged. The implementation of the optimal policy balance would yield an additional benefit in terms of net present value of approximately $120 million over 50 years. The results from sensitivity analysis affirm the importance of restoration over promotion policy and suggest that improving effectiveness of restoration expenditure and reducing visitor impact on environmental quality can significantly increase benefits from tourism."
"Analysis of stereotactic biopsies performed on suspicious calcifications identified within 24 months after completion of breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy for early breast cancer: Can biopsy be obviated?  2017 Elsevier Inc.Background: To determine the cancer yield of stereotactic biopsy of suspicious calcifications identified within 24 months after breast conservation therapy (BCT). Methods: Retrospective review of stereotactic biopsies performed during 2009–2013 for suspicious calcifications in the ipsilateral breast of patients who completed BCT. Results: 94/2773 (3.4%) had stereotactic biopsies for suspicious calcifications in the ipsilateral breast; 7/94 (7.4%) had DCIS (6) or invasive (1) cancer; 5/7 occurred in the same breast quadrant as the primary. All 7 originally had negative surgical margins (≥2 mm); 6 received whole breast irradiation, and 2 received adjuvant chemotherapy + endocrine therapy. Median time to detection was 11 months (range, 6–20 months). There was a strong association between calcification morphology (particularly pleomorphic) and likelihood of malignancy (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Stereotactic biopsy of calcifications identified within 24 months post-BCT has a 7% cancer yield. Tissue biopsy should be performed rather than imaging followup alone when breast calcifications have suspicious morphology."
"The cadaveric feasibility study of using filler augmentation at the lower nose for the reinforcement of the external nasal valve  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Background: Filler injections have been used in rhinoplasty to correct minor nose deformities and to augment the nasal dorsum. At the lower nose, the procedures are used to increase nasal tip projection and improve the bulbous nasal tip but they have never been used in the correction of the lateral crus weakness and collapsed external nasal valves. Methods: The study was conducted with 14 human cadavers that underwent lower nose injection rhinoplasty using the columellar and alar injections as tripod augmentation. The nasal alae were tunneled and retrogradely injected by a needle. The compared parameters measured to evaluate the improvement before and after the treatment were basilar nasal width, interalar width, columella-nasal tip height, columellar-labial angle, and the length and width of the nostrils. Measurements were taken with a digital caliper. All measurements were matched and compared for statistical analysis. Results: There were seven male and seven female Thai cadavers. Most of the values of the parameters were increased, but the basilar nasal width and interalar width were not changed. The columellar-labial angle, columella-nasal tip height, and nostril’s length showed statistically significant differences (P < .05), leading to positive changes in the nostril cross-sectional area, the nasal tip projection and the external nasal valve. Conclusions: Injection rhinoplasty of the lower nose as tripod augmentation of the external nasal valve increases the nasal tip projection and the nostril cross-sectional area thus improving the functional and esthetic appearance.Level of Evidence: Not ratable."
"A randomized controlled trial of the impact of pharmacist-led patient-centered pharmaceutical care on patients’ medicine therapy-related quality of life  2017 Elsevier Inc.Background: Due to a lack of pharmaceutical care (PC)-specific measures for health-related quality of life, a novel generic questionnaire “Patient-Reported Outcomes Measure of Pharmaceutical Therapy for Quality of Life (PROMPT-QoL) was developed. Little was also known about an impact of pharmaceutical care on medicine therapy-related quality of life. Objective: First, evaluate the impact of PC on medicine therapy-related QoL using the PROMPT-QoL in Thai patients. Second, compare the outcomes of drug-related problems (DRPs) between usual care (UC) and PC groups. Third, assess the responsiveness of the PROMPT-QoL. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary public hospital in Bangkok, Thailand from March to October 2016. A total of 514 patients were randomly allocated into the UC (N = 255) and pharmacist-led patient-centered PC (N = 259) groups. The follow-up period was three months. Results: A split-plot ANOVA showed that the PC group significantly improved four domain scores and total score of the PROMPT-QoL than the UC group (all p < 0.01). For improved patients in the PC group (N = 164), the responsiveness of these four domains and the total score was moderate-to-high with standardized effect sizes between 0.23 and 3.01. The PC group also significantly yielded higher proportion of patients with better DRP outcomes than the UC group (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Pharmacist-led patient-centered PC could improve patients’ medicine therapy-related QoL and DRP outcomes. Four out of eight domains and the total score of the PROMPT-QoL were responsive to assess a humanistic impact of PC. More research can be conducted in longer follow-up periods."
"Increased Root Canal Endotoxin Levels are Associated with Chronic Apical Periodontitis, Increased Oxidative and Nitrosative Stress, Major Depression, Severity of Depression, and a Lowered Quality of Life  2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Evidence indicates that major depression is accompanied by increased translocation of gut commensal Gram-negative bacteria (leaky gut) and consequent activation of oxidative and nitrosative (O&NS) pathways. This present study examined the associations among chronic apical periodontitis (CAP), root canal endotoxin levels (lipopolysaccharides, LPS), O&NS pathways, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Measurements included advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), lipid peroxides (LOOH), −sulfhydryl (SH) groups, total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in participants with CAP, with and without depression, as well as healthy controls (no depression, no CAP). Root canal LPS levels were positively associated with CAP, clinical depression, severity of depression (as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory) and O&NS biomarkers, especially NOx and TRAP. CAP-related depression was accompanied by increased levels of NOx, LOOH, AOPP, and TRAP. In CAP participants, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.734, p OpenSPiltSPi 0.001) between root canal LPS and the HDRS score. There were significant and positive associations between CAP or root canal endotoxin with the vegetative and physio-somatic symptoms of the HDRS as well as a significant inverse association between root canal endotoxin and quality of life with strong effects on psychological, environmental, and social domains. It is concluded that increased root canal LPS accompanying CAP may cause depression and a lowered quality of life, which may be partly explained by activated O&NS pathways, especially NOx thereby enhancing hypernitrosylation and thus neuroprogressive processes. Dental health and “leaky teeth” may be intimately linked to the etiology and course of depression, while significantly impacting quality of life."
"Characteristics of hydrochar and liquid fraction from hydrothermal carbonization of cassava rhizome  2017 Energy InstituteHydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of cassava rhizome (CR) was performed to investigate the effect of process parameters including temperature, time, and biomass to water ratio (BTW) on characteristics of hydrochar and liquid fraction products. The effect of temperature was two-fold. First, an increase in reaction temperature from 160 to 180 °C decreased hydrochar yield from 54 to 51%, however, a further increase of temperature from 180 to 200 °C saw an increase in the hydrochar yield to 58%. This was associated to degradation, polymerization, and condensation reactions during HTC. The hydrogen/carbon and oxygen/carbon atomic ratios decreased from 1.4 and 0.6 at 160 °C to 1.2 and 0.4 at 200 °C, respectively. The liquid fraction contained various valuable chemical species including, glucose, furan compounds, (furfural, furfuryl alcohol, hydroxymethylfurfural), volatile fatty acid (succinic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, levulinic acid, and propionic acid) with their highest yields (wt.% dry raw material) of 4.5, 18.5, and 24.3, respectively."
"Spur and helical gear sliding loss model with load distribution pattern on gear tooth surface  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The model for estimation of spur and helical gear sliding loss with load distribution pattern on gear tooth surface is presented in this paper. The load distribution for the spur gear is considered to distribute uniformly along the line of contact. During double teeth meshing, load sharing ratio between meshing teeth is considered to be 33:67 percent or 45:55 percent. For the helical gear the load distribution can be calculated by the method proposed by Niemann and Richter. The contour plots of load distribution on gear tooth surface conform to the tooth contact patterns obtained experimentally. The sliding losses estimated from the presented method are compared with the estimations done by the former model and also the experimental results. It is found that the sliding losses calculated from the presented method are closer to the experimental results than the estimations from the former model. The effects of the helix angle and pressure angle on the sliding loss can also be estimated correctly by the presented method."
"Electronic and ionic conductivities enhancement of zinc anode for flexible printed zinc-air battery  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Zinc-air batteries are considered promising energy storage devices for future energy applications due to their high energy density, safety, and low cost. However, poor battery performance and low efficiency of zinc utilization, resulted from passivation effect of the zinc anode, is a major challenge. Thus, in this work, investigation of electronic and ionic conductivities enhancement of the zinc anode for flexible printed zinc-air batteries has been carried out. The anode was made from zinc-based inks, prepared from a mixture of zinc and zinc oxide particles. Carbon black, sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) were investigated for implementation on the anode. The results showed that performance of the batteries increased when carbon black was introduced into the anode as the presence of carbon black improved electronic conductivity of the anode. Again, the batteries performed better when Bi2O3 or Na2SiO3 was introduced due to the formation of solid electrolyte interface(SEI) on the anode. The SEI inhibits passivation of zinc active surfaces and provides effective electrolyte access. The batteries with Bi2O3 provided the best performance. The highest performance was observed when Bi2O3 content reached 26 wt.%. No significant improvement was observed when Bi2O3 concentration increased higher than 26 wt.%."

"Effect of water hardness and pH on adsorption kinetic of arsenate on iron oxide  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The adsorption of arsenate on iron oxide particles was studied as a function of pH and hardness concentrations. Morphology of the studied iron oxide surface was rough and irregular. The major chemical composition of iron oxide particles was Fe2O3 (96%). The optimal solution pH for adsorption was 8.0. The equilibrium of arsenic concentration was reached after 1 hour of contact time. The adsorption capacity (qe) increased with increasing iron oxide particles. Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second order reaction were best descriptors of arsenate adsorption behavior. Calcium or magnesium concentrations did not significantly affect the adsorbed concentration of arsenic at equilibrium. However, arsenate adsorption was higher at low pH and decreased significantly with increasing pH."
"A novel fluidized bed reactor configuration for nitrate reduction and low strength anaerobic wastewater treatment  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.In this research, hydrodynamic behaviour in a novel fluidized bed reactor (FBR) was studied using a residence time distribution (RTD) experiment. The RTD experimental result showed that the liquid flow pattern closely resembled plug flow behaviour. This research utilized the novel FBR under low hydraulic retention time (HRT) operation (without internal recirculation), and thus the novel FBR’s performance should be further investigated. Two wastewater treatment applications were studied in this research. The first application was to use the novel FBR for denitrification at COD:NO3--N of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1. The highest nitrate removal was obtained at a ratio of COD:NO3--N of 3:1, with a removal efficiency of 99 ± 1%. The second application was to use the novel FBR for low strength anaerobic wastewater treatment. The novel FBR achieved 86 ± 6% of COD removal efficiency at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 5.6 g COD L-1 d-1."
"Particulate matter monitoring using inexpensive sensors and internet GIS: A case study in nan, Thailand  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Thailand has faced environmental issues that affect people all the time. Haze from the forest fires for instance is concerned as national problem that we confront every year. To determine the severity of smog conditions being a consequence of haze fire in some areas cannot be easily done. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) then could be easily used as a tool for surveying in such difficult burning areas. Furthermore having the environmental sensing devices developed and mounted on the UAV would be a worthy approach for monitoring environmental status in hazardous areas. This research was conducted to assemble the UAV and sensor device for measuring the environmental data including temperature, humidity and dust particle. The sensor was calibrated with reference devices. The field test was carried out in Nan province. Together with temperature, humidity and dust particle value, the location and time from GPS on UAV will be integrated correspondingly with environmental measuring data. Those entirely data will be imported to GIS and rendered in map form subsequently."

"Fabrication of hierarchical porous ZnO/NiO hollow microspheres for adsorptive removal of Congo red  2017 Elsevier B.V. Hierarchical porous zinc oxide (ZnO)/nickel(II) oxide (NiO) hollow microspheres were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal approach and subsequent calcination process. The synthesized samples were used as adsorbent for removing Congo red (CR), a commercial azo dye. The synthesized hierarchical porous ZnO/NiO composites exhibit a superior adsorption capacity for CR (518 mg/g), compared with pure NiO (397 mg/g) and ZnO (304 mg/g). The high CR adsorption capacity of ZnO/NiO composites was associated with its hierarchical porous hollow structures and large specific surface area (130 m 2 /g), which provide a large quantity of active sites for CR molecules. The adsorption kinetics data were perfectly fitted to a pseudo-second-order model. The isotherms were accurately described by the Langmuir model. The results suggest that the as-prepared hierarchical porous ZnO/NiO composites are a highly efficient adsorbent for treating organic dye-impacted wastewater."
"Aminoquinoline-Salicylaldimine Dyads as Highly Selective Turn-On Fluorescent Sensors for Zinc (II) Ions  2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimFour new derivatives of 8-aminoquinolines are successfully synthesized by extension of the -conjugated system on the quinoline ring and incorporation of either the salicylaldimine or its reduced amino form. These compounds show selective fluorescence enhancement by Zn2+ ion, attributing to the chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) effects, in which the deprotonation of the amido –NH and phenolic -OH causes the internal charge transfer (ICT) process. The fluorescent signals of these compounds are shifted from the range of 391–562 nm to 535–590 nm upon addition of Zn2+. The sensing mechanism is investigated by 1H NMR titration, mass spectrometry, and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis which suggests a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between the sensor and Zn2+. The detection limits of 0.024 to 0.431 μM and the association constants ranging between 7.0 × 103 and 1.2 × 104 M−1 can be estimated for these four sensors. One of these compounds is fabricated on wax-patterned filter paper and used as a probe for Zn2+ in aqueous solution with a naked-eye detection limit at 10 μM."
"Heavy metal (Cd and pb) and aflatoxin contamination in tissues and eggs from free grazing ducks and their environment in central thailand  Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018.The cross-sectional study of heavy metals and aflatoxins was conducted by studying duck egg, blood, liver, feed, and water samples from 11 free grazing farms. The duck feed, soil, and rice samples were lower than the standard limit for aflatoxins at 20 ng g−1. The highest levels of aflatoxin were detected in the liver, intestine, and egg yolk; these were 3.04, 1.73, and 4.56 ng g−1 respectively, while the average levels were 1.6 ± 0.73, 1.31 ± 0.23, and 1.87 ± 0.99 ng g−1, respectively. Interestingly, aflatoxin was not detected in any of the egg white albumin samples (90/90 samples), whereas aflatoxin contamination was predominantly found in the yolk. Additionally, the means and standard deviations of Pb and Cd found in the duck eggs were 118.61 ± 22.25 and 13.84 ± 9.06 ng g−1 respectively. The maximum levels of Pb and Cd in eggs were 134.34 and 29.72 ng g−1, respectively. Moreover, Pb contamination occurred in the duck liver tissue in 93.61% (88/94) of the samples, whereas Cd contamination was found in 100% (100/100). The maximum levels of Pb and Cd in the duck liver tissues were 606.16 and 22,946.20 ng g−1, which was higher than those in the eggs. Pb contamination in the water from rice paddy fields after grazing was significantly higher than that in water samples taken before grazing. This is the first report of Pb and Cd contamination in blood, egg, and liver samples of free grazing ducks in Thailand."
"Stable and effective proton exchange membrane formation via cross-linking the polymeric proton donor and proton acceptor in a layer-by-layer structure  2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCSystematic arrangement of the proton donor and acceptor as a layer-by-layer (LbL) structure is one of the simplest surface modification methods to improve the proton conductivity of a proton exchange membrane. In general, LbL assembly occurs via physical or chemical interaction between each deposited layer. Here, the stabilization of the proton donor and acceptor polymers by cross-linking those two layers together was applied as a concept. The challenge was the molecular design of the proton donor and accepter polymer species to each have compatible cross-linkable functional groups as well as proton transfer species in the molecules. Poly(acrylic acid) decorated with different amounts of thiol groups (PAA-M) was synthesized, while benzimidazole decorated branching polyethyleneimine was functionalized with maleimide groups (BIm-PEI-MI). The cross-linkable proton donor and acceptor were alternately LbL deposited on a sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) surface. The LbL membrane with an optimum crosslink level showed a proton conductivity of up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure SPEEK membrane even at a temperature as high as 170 °C."
"Scenarios of municipal solid waste management for mitigating greenhouse gas emission: A case study of supermarket in Bangkok, Thailand  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.As a consequence of rapid urbanization and population growth, many cities have faces issues of waste management. Landfill approach is generally decided for handling most of municipal solid waste, resulting the impacts of environment especially land occupation and global warming. As commercial building plays an importance role not only for economic value but also for environmental aspects, a supermarket located in community mall was selected as a case study towards sustainable cities. This study was aimed to investigate the current MSW management system of supermarket in order to quantify its environmental performance and to propose suitable options for improving municipal solid waste management. The findings revealed that at the business-Asusual, 397 tCO2e was emitted annually from landfilling waste of a supermarket in Thailand. However, if waste management has improved by recycling plus bio-gasification approach, not only 374 tCO2e/year will not be emitted from landfilling, but 243 tCO2e/year also be reduced due to the activities in relevant to recycling and bio-gasification process. Moreover, applying such approach provides benefit in economic term about 18,321 USD a year. The results of this study could inspire another commercial buildings or others sector to adopting waste management practices together for creating a network of sustainable cities through suitable waste management system."
"Evaluation of CSR project from the economic, environmental and social performances monitoring by using the case study of renewable energy for a community project in Thailand  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Recently, sustainable development becomes a major global issue for the mankind. In order to meet this criteria, main objectives that composed of three aspects which are environment, economic, and social has to be completely met. Practically, the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is one of a useful tools that can promote the sustainable development effectively in which decent amount of renown companies in Thailand operate and find it quite successful for some degrees. For this study, the goal was to investigate the current situation of renewable energy for a community project in Thailand. The biogas production from swine farms was used as the representative case study to evaluate the economic, environmental and social performance. The key performance indicators (KPI) were used which based on the ISO 2600:2010. The study revealed that the project provided the returns rate on the investment to the public in the form of ""Social return on investment"" (SROI) to be 6.59 which indicated that the CSR project is worth for the investment. In addition, the net present value (NPV) could also promote the benefits in term of economic for about 3,038,137 THB per year. For the environmental perspective, the biogas from swine farm can cause the reduction in energy/fuel consumption along with the utilization of treated waste sludge as a fertilizer which also gain the carbon credits from GHG emission mitigation. As for the social perspective, the benefit gains were in the form of monetary along with the increasing of employment rate which resulted from the CSR biogas production projects were used to calculate for the economic perspective as the direct economic value which accounted for over 389,149 THB per year. The results of this study can be a useful case study for project owners or related sectors to make the improvement and moving toward the sustainable development later on."
"Model combining pre-transplant tumor biomarkers and tumor size shows more utility in predicting hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence and survival than the BALAD models  The Author(s) 2018. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.AIM To assess the performance of BALAD, BALAD-2 and their component biomarkers in predicting outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after liver transplant. METHODS BALAD score and BALAD-2 class are derived from bilirubin, albumin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3), and des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP). Pre-transplant AFP, AFP-L3 and DCP were measured in 113 patients transplanted for HCC from 2000 to 2008. Hazard ratios (HR) for recurrence and death were calculated. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted. C-statistics were used to compare biomarker-based to predictive models. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 12.2 years, 38 patients recurred and 87 died. The HRs for recurrence in patients with elevated AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP defined by BALAD cut-off values were 2.42 (1.18-5.00), 1.86 (0.98-3.52), and 2.83 (1.42-5.61), respectively. For BALAD, the HRs for recurrence and death per unit increased score were 1.48 (1.15-1.91) and 1.59 (1.28-1.97). For BALAD-2, the HRs for recurrence and death per unit increased class were 1.45 (1.06-1.98) and 1.38 (1.09-1.76). For recurrence prediction, the combination of three biomarkers had the highest c-statistic of 0.66 vs. 0.64, 0.61, 0.53, and 0.53 for BALAD, BALAD-2, Milan, and UCSF, respectively. Similarly, for death prediction, the combination of three biomarkers had the highest c-statistic of 0.66 vs 0.65, 0.61, 0.52, and 0.50 for BALAD, BALAD-2, Milan, and UCSF. A new model combining biomarkers with tumor size at the time of transplant (S-LAD) demonstrated the highest predictive capability with c-statistics of 0.71 and 0.69 for recurrence and death. CONCLUSION BALAD and BALAD-2 are valid in transplant HCC patients, but less predictive than the three biomarkers in combination or the three biomarkers in combination with maximal tumor diameter (S-LAD)."
"Influence of the admicelled poly(methyl methacrylate) on the compatibility and toughness of poly(lactic acid) Copyright  Materials Research Society 2018.Admicellar polymerization, a novel technique for surface modification, was used in this work to enhance the compatibility between polymers with obviously different polarities, e.g., natural rubber (NR) and polylactic acid (PLA). The admicellar polymerization of methyl methacrylate over NR substrates (using potassium peroxodisulfate as an initiator) so-called poly(methyl methacrylate)-natural rubber (PMMA-ad-NR) was prepared and mixed with PLA at different contents (5, 10, and 15 wt%) in comparison to the simple PLA/NR blends. The monomer to initiator ratio was varied: 25:1, 50:1, and 100:1 corresponding to the admicelled PMMA molecular weight of 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000 g/mol, respectively. All PLA/PMMA-ad-NR blends showed good compatibility as evident by FE-SEM results revealing smooth boundary of PMMA-ad-NR domains in the PLA matrix. Moreover, the mechanical properties and thermal stability of PLA/PMMA-ad-NR blends were higher than those of PLA/NR blends, especially with increasing PMMA-ad-NR content up to 10 wt%. It was clear that the lowest molecular weight of the admicelled PMMA gave the highest toughness of PLA/PMMA-ad-NR blends."
"Designing Model for Calculating the Amount of Cyber Risk Insurance  2017 IEEE.In the last few years, rising sophistication and impact of cyberattacks has led companies to reassessment of their approach to risk management. Many of them admitted that they are not able to successfully prevent these attacks and they tried to find other ways to mitigate the risk. One of the possible solutions can be a cybersecurity insurance that enables companies to transfer the risk connected with a security breach to an insurance company. Basic problem is then how the cost of insurance should be calculated and how to assess the level of client's IT security controls and related risk. Unlike traditional insurance that derives the premium from target value and statistical models, the cyber insurance should take into account other factors. In this article, authors propose scoring model for cyber insurance that is based on the results of internal and external audits and compliance with mandatory and voluntary standards."
"Assessment of population coverage of hypertension screening in Thailand based on the effective coverage framework  2018 The Author(s).Background: Hypertension (HT) is a major risk factor, and accessible and effective HT screening services are necessary. The effective coverage framework is an assessment tool that can be used to assess health service performance by considering target population who need and receive quality service. The aim of this study is to measure effective coverage of hypertension screening services at the provincial level in Thailand. Methods: Over 40 million individual health service records in 2013 were acquired. Data on blood pressure measurement, risk assessment, HT diagnosis and follow up were analyzed. The effectiveness of the services was assessed based on a set of quality criteria for pre-HT, suspected HT, and confirmed HT cases. Effective coverage of HT services for all non-HT Thai population aged 15 or over was estimated for each province and for all Thailand. Results: Population coverage of HT screening is 54.6%, varying significantly across provinces. Among those screened, 28.9% were considered pre-HT, and another 6.0% were suspected HT cases. The average provincial effective coverage was at 49.9%. Around four-fifths (82.6%) of the pre-HT group received HT and Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk assessment. Among the suspected HT cases, less than half (38.0%) got a follow-up blood pressure measurement within 60 days from the screening date. Around 9.2% of the suspected cases were diagnosed as having HT, and only one-third of them (36.5%) received treatment within 6 months. Within this group, 21.8% obtained CVD risk assessment, and half of them had their blood pressure under control (50.8%) with less than 1 % (0.7%) of them managed to get the CVD risk reduced. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hypertension screening coverage, post-screening service quality, and effective coverage of HT screening in Thailand were still low and they vary greatly across provinces. It is imperative that service coverage and its effectiveness are assessed, and both need improvement. Despite some limitations, measurement of effective coverage could be done with existing data, and it can serve as a useful tool for performance measurement of public health services."
"Feature based analysis friendly video coding scheme for HEVC  2018 IEEE.This paper proposes an algorithm to maintain feature information of compressed video in high efficiency video coding (HEVC), where feature information is defined by SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) detector. Adaptive largest coding unit (LCU) selection is defined to determine LCU into two different groups, important LCU group and non-important LCU group. Moreover, two different bit allocations are generated in rate control to each group based on coding mode selection, Intra or Inter mode, to achieve target bit rate and also guarantee the feature information can be maintained. Experimental results show proposed method can achieve better SIFT similarity than original HEVC encoder from 1% to 10% at the same target bit."

"An SDN framework for video conference in inter-domain network  2018 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).Video conference is the most popular application which is required high quality of service (QoS) such as delay and jitter. Several existing mechanisms for enhancing were proposed in the traditional network not only at the application side as video clients but also at the network core as network routers. Although, these mechanisms can provide a good quality of service, they require a lot of maintenance cost. In addition, the static routing with the shortest-path fashion at the network gateways is not enough to provide a high quality of service for video/audio data transferring due to the affectation of background traffic. Software Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that allows a network operator to manage their network environment by programmable centralized control. This not only reduces the cost of maintenance but also increase the performance of networking. In this paper, we proposed an SDN framework for video conference in inter-domain network. The framework used the Packet Pair technique to consider the characteristics of bandwidth and end-to-end delay between two video conference clients. A transferring path and network gateway inside-domain are set up based on this information without a requirement of a routing modification of outside-domains. The evaluation results from Mininet emulator and OF@TEIN testbed show that our framework outperforms the traditional networking significantly in terms of QoS metrics."
"The effect of religious intervention on depressive symptoms and quality of life among indonesian elderly in nursing homes: A quasi-experimental study  2018 Pramesona and Taneepanichskul.Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the effect of religious intervention on depressive symptoms and quality of life (QOL) among Indonesian elderly in nursing homes (NHs). Patients and methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with repeated measures. Sixty elderly residents at three NHs in three districts in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score of 5-11 were recruited and purposively assigned to the religious intervention group (combining 36 sessions of listening to Qur’anic recital and 3 sessions of attending a sermon by a preacher, n=30) and the control group (treatment as usual/TAU, n=30). The primary outcome was depression, measured by a short form GDS questionnaire. The QOL as the secondary outcome was assessed by the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF Indonesian version. Both groups were evaluated at the baseline, 4th, 8th, and 12th week after the interventions were performed. Results: In both groups, there were statistically significant reductions in depression scores after the 12-week intervention (P<0.001). There was also a statistically significant improvement in QOL mean scores in both intervention and control groups at the 12-week post-intervention. However, the religious intervention group showed a greater decrease in depressive symptoms and a greater improvement in the QOL mean scores than those in the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in geriatric depression and QOL mean scores between groups at the 4th, 8th, and 12th week post-interventions. Conclusions: It can be concluded that religious-based intervention has a greater impact on relieving depressive symptoms and increasing the QOL amongst elderly NH residents."
"EYE-CAPTCHA: An enhanced CAPTCHA using eye movement  2017 IEEE.CAPTCHA is a system used to distinguish between human and machine, typically as a method to prevent spam and automatic data extraction from a bot or an attacker. As a result of continuing advances in computer capability and artificial intelligence, distinguishing between human and computer becomes more difficult. With this reason, some spammers can break CAPTCHA and attack the system with an appropriate algorithm. To improve more reliability, biometric authentication can be used to enhance the system security by verifying the identity of a person based on physiological or behavioral characteristics. One of the promising methods for biometric authentication is the identification through unique eye movement characteristics. This paper proposes a new CAPTCHA based on eye movement characteristics, namely, EYE-CAPTCHA. The proposed method employs gaze detection and eye movement control. With this proposed system, the system can achieve more reliability for differentiating human and machine."
"Analysis of wild macaque stone tools used to crack oil palm nuts  2018 The Authors.The discovery of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) nut-cracking by wild long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) is significant for the study of non-human primate and hominin percussive behaviour. Up until now, only West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and modern human populations were known to use stone hammers to crack open this particular hard-shelled palm nut. The addition of non-habituated, wild macaques increases our comparative dataset of primate lithic percussive behaviour focused on this one plant species. Here, we present an initial description of hammerstones used by macaques to crack oil palm nuts, recovered from active nut-cracking locations on Yao Noi Island, Ao Phang Nga National Park, Thailand. We combine a techno-typological approach with microscopic and macroscopic use-wear analysis of percussive damage to characterize the percussive signature of macaque palm oil nut-cracking tools. These artefacts are characterized by a high degree of battering and crushing on most surfaces, which is visible at both macro and microscopic levels. The degree and extent of this damage is a consequence of a dynamic interplay between a number of factors, including anvil morphology and macaque percussive techniques. Beyond the behavioural importance of these artefacts, macaque nut-cracking represents a new target for primate archaeological investigations, and opens new opportunities for comparisons between tool using primate species and with early hominin percussive behaviour, for which nut-cracking has been frequently inferred."
"Formulation of microemulsion-based washing agent for oil recovery from spent bleaching earth-hydrophilic lipophilic deviation concept  2018 Elsevier B.V.The disposal of spent bleaching earth (SBE), an industrial refining waste from the bleaching process, is a crucial environmental issue. The objective of this work was thus to formulate a microemulsion-based washing agent for the removal of residual rice bran oil from SBE using the hydrophilic–lipophilic deviation (HLD) concept. The HLD equation was used to calculate the optimum salinity at various temperatures in the washing agent solution based on the alkane carbon number (ACN) of the rice bran oil. Three fatty alcohol ethoxylate surfactants (Dehydol LS series) were selected for use as nonionic surfactants. From the HLD equation and phase experiments, Dehydol LS3TH was selected to formulate the microemulsion-based washing agent for oil recovery from the SBE. The HLD equation predicted a Winsor Type III microemulsion to occur at 8.5 wt.% of NaCl at 25 °C. Phase behavior studies demonstrated that a Type III microemulsion occurred over a NaCl concentration range of 10–20 wt.%. From these results, a correlation was confirmed between the theoretical HLD prediction and the experimental phase behavior. In the oil recovery study, the microemulsion-based washing agent provided the highest total oil extraction efficiency: up to 71.38 ± 1.75% at the optimum salinity of 15 wt.% NaCl, and a contact time of 30 min at 25 °C. Thus, the HLD concept for predicting microemulsion formulation was found to be an effective way to formulate a microemulsion-based washing agent for vegetable oil removal from SBE."
"Thai-Lepto-on-admission probability (THAI-LEPTO) score as an early tool for initial diagnosis of leptospirosis: Result from Thai-Lepto AKI study group  2018 Sukmark et al.Background: Leptospirosis is one of the most important zoonosis in the tropics. Currently, specific laboratory diagnostic test for leptospirosis such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or direct culture cannot be applied at the primary care setting especially in the resource- limited countries. Therefore, clinical presentation and laboratory examination are still the primary diagnostic tools for leptospirosis. Objectives: To detect clinical factors for predicting leptospirosis in suspected cases, and to create a clinical prediction score (THAI-LEPTO) that is practical and easy to use in general practice while awaiting laboratory results. Materials and methods: We performed a prospective multicenter study with a development and a validation cohort of patients presenting with clinical suspicion of leptospirosis as per the WHO clinical criteria. The development cohort was conducted at 11 centers in 8 provinces around Thailand. The validation cohort was conducted at 4 centers in 1 province from the Northeastern part of Thailand. Leptospirosis confirmed cases were defined if any one of the tests were positive: microscopic agglutination test, direct culture, or PCR technique. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of leptospirosis. The clinical prediction score was derived from the regression coefficients (original) or from the odds ratio values (simplified). We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic ability of our score and to find the optimal cutoff values of the score. We used a validation cohort to evaluate the accuracy of our methods. Results: In the development cohort, we enrolled 221 leptospirosis suspected cases and analyzed 211. Among those, 105 (50%) were leptospirosis confirmed cases. In logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, day of fever, and one clinical factor at a time, leptospirosis group had more hypotension OR = 2.76 (95% CI 1.07–7.10), jaundice OR = 3.40 (95%CI 1.48–8.44), muscle pain OR = 2.12 (95%CI 1.06–4.26), acute kidney injury (AKI) OR = 2.90 (95%CI 1.31–6.15), low hemoglobin OR = 3.48 (95%CI 1.72–7.04), and hypokalemia with hyponatremia OR = 3.56 (95%CI 1.17–10.84) than non-leptospirosis group. The abovementioned factors along with neutrophilia and pulmonary opacity were used in the development of the score. The simplified score with 7 variables was the summation of the odds ratio values as follows: hypotension 3, jaundice 2, muscle pain 2, AKI 1.5, low hemoglobin 3, hypokalemia with hyponatremia 3, and neutrophilia 1. The score showed the highest discriminatory power with area under the curve (AUC) 0.82 (95%CI 0.67–0.97) on fever day 3–4. In the validation cohort we enrolled 96 leptospirosis suspected cases and analyzed 92. Of those, 69 (75%) were leptospirosis confirmed cases. The performance of the simplified score with 7 variables at a cutoff of 4 was AUC 0.78 (95%CI 0.68–0.89); sensitivity 73.5; specificity 73.7; positive predictive value 87.8; negative predictive value 58.3. Conclusions: THAI-LEPTO score is a newly developed diagnostic tool for early presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis in patients presenting with severe clinical suspicion of the disease. The score can easily be applied at the point of care while awaiting confirmatory laboratory results. Each predictor used has been supported by evidence of clinical and pathophysiological correlation."
"Cyclization of aromatic aldehydes and phenylenediamines under reduced pressure: A convenient, environmentally friendly, and simple procedure for benzimidazole precursors  2018 Taylor & Francis.The condensation of phenylenediamines with aromatic aldehydes in the presence of catalysts to obtain benzimidazoles under harsh condition is achieved by various reported conditions. The present work demonstrates a convenient, environmentally friendly, and simple procedure to obtain benzimidazoles through the cyclization between phenylenediamines and aromatic aldehydes under reduced pressure. By simply adding aromatic aldehydes to diaminobenzene derivatives and allowing the stoichiometric reaction at room temperature under reduced pressure at 66.6 Pa, the dehydrogenation leads to benzimidazoles with the yield as high as 80–90%. In addition, the purging of H2 gas to benzimidazoles results in the hydrogenation of imidazole to obtain the intermediate benzimidazolidine form. This confirms how the cyclization relies on the reduced pressure. This synthesis pathway not only gives the aromatic aldehydes with high yield under the mild condition but also the selection of benzaldehydes with reactive functional groups leads to the precursors for other chemical modifications and polymerizations."
"Use of copper intrauterine device is not associated with higher bacterial vaginosis prevalence in Thai HIV-positive women  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The study assessed and compared bacterial vaginosis (BV) prevalence in Thai women in reproductive age in four study groups – group 1, HIV-positive with copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD); group 2, HIV-positive without Cu-IUD; group 3, HIV-negative with Cu-IUD; and group 4, HIV-negative without Cu-IUD. We conducted a cross-sectional study. BV prevalence was assessed by Nugent score and Amsel criteria. Descriptive statistics was used to present baseline characteristics; kwallis rank test – to compare variables between the four groups; logistic regression – to assess factors, related to BV prevalence. The analysis included 137 women in the four study groups with a median age of 39 years. Median BV prevalence by Nugent score was 45%, intermediate vaginal flora – 7% and normal vaginal flora – 48%. There was no statistically significant difference in the BV prevalence between the four study groups, p = 0.711. Threefold lower BV prevalence was found, assessed by Amsel criteria compared to Nugent score. Women with body mass index (BMI) < 20 had higher probability to have BV or intermediate vaginal flora, OR = 3.11, 95% CI (1.2–8.6), p = 0.025. The study found a high BV prevalence in the four study groups, related neither to HIV status, nor to Cu-IUD use. BV prevalence was associated only with low BMI. Thus, Cu-IUD could be a good contraceptive choice for HIV-positive women. Research in defining normal vaginal microbiota and improve diagnostic methods for BV should continue."
"Molecular simulations of a CO2/CO mixture in MIL-127  2018Adsorption and diffusion of an equimolar feed mixture of CO2 and CO in MIL-127 at three different temperatures and pressures up to 12 bar were investigated by molecular simulations. The adsorption was simulated using Gibbs-Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC). The structure of the adsorbed phase and the diffusion in the MIL were investigated using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The adsorption selectivity of MIL-127 for CO2 over CO at 233 K was about 15. When combining adsorption and diffusion selectivities, a membrane selectivity of about 12 is predicted. For higher temperatures, both adsorption and diffusion selectivity are found to be smaller."

"Continuous positive airway pressure therapy in gestational diabetes with obstructive sleep apnea: A randomized controlled trial  2018 American Academy of Sleep Medicine. All rights reserved.Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study assessed the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in obese pregnant females with GDM and OSA. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted (April 2014-June 2016). Obese females at 24 to 34 weeks gestation and with diet-controlled GDM were screened for OSA. Those with OSA were randomly assigned to receive 2 weeks nightly CPAP or be part of a waitlist control group. After 2 weeks, all patients were offered CPAP. The primary outcome was glucose metabolism, obtained from an oral meal tolerance test (MTT) at baseline and 2 weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were collected. Results: Eighteen patients were randomized to CPAP and 18 to control groups. There were no significant changes between groups in fasting glucose, glucose response to MTT, and insulin sensitivity or secretion after 2 weeks. Those adherent to CPAP had significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .016) compared to the control group. When a counterfactual instrumental variable approach was applied to deal with nonadherence, the CPAP group had significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .002) and insulin sensitivity (P = .015). Lower rates of preterm delivery (P = .002), unplanned cesarean section (P = .005), and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (P < .001) were observed among those who used CPAP longer than 2 weeks. Conclusions: Two weeks of CPAP in females with GDM and OSA did not result in improved glucose levels, but insulin secretion improved in those adherent to CPAP. Continued CPAP use was possibly associated with improved pregnancy outcomes."
"Effects of putrescine treatment on the quality attributes and antioxidant activities of ‘Nam Dok Mai No.4’ mango fruit during storage  2018 Elsevier B.V.This research is aimed at investigating the benefits of the exogenous application of putrescine on the postharvest quality and antioxidant activities of ‘Nam Dok Mai No.4’ mango. Mangoes harvested at commercial maturity were dipped into 1, 2, and 4 mmol/L putrescine (PUT) for 20 min while distilled water was used as the control. Treated fruit were stored at 14 °C for 9 days and then transferred to storage at 25 °C for 9 days. The 2 mmol/L PUT proved to be the most effective in keeping mango fruit quality intact during fruit ripening. Fruit hardness and titratable acidity (TA) were observed to be higher in treated fruit. The PUT treatment also caused a reduction in weight loss and soluble solids content (SSC). Moreover, 2 mmol/L PUT treated fruit exhibited the maximum superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and total antioxidant contents of fruit during storage. These findings suggest that exogenous application of 2 mmol/L PUT could be an effective treatment for prolonging the storage life and enhancing antioxidant activities of ‘Nam Dok Mai No.4’ mango after harvest."
"Graphene Oxide and Microwave Synergism for Efficient Esterification of Fatty Acids  2018 American Chemical Society.The synthesis of biodiesel or fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from alternative feedstocks such as waste cooking oil through conventional transesterification process is challenged by the presence of significant amounts of free fatty acids (FFAs). Alternatively, these FFAs can also serve as raw material for the synthesis of FAMEs through acid-catalyzed esterification. In this study, we utilized graphene oxide (GO) as a carbon-based heterogeneous acid catalyst in synergy with microwave (MW) heating as a novel approach for an efficient synthesis of FAMEs by esterification reaction at a shorter reaction time. Under this process, 99.2% FAME was achieved at 3 min, methanol/oleic acid molar ratio of 12, MW power of 200 W, and 1 wt % catalyst. It shows excellent catalytic performance, which is more active than Amberlyst 15, sulfated zirconia, and graphite oxide. Among the process variables investigated, the ratio of methanol/oleic acid is the most important factor for higher FAME yield. Additionally, the MW absorbing property of catalyst is necessary for a successful synthesis. Therefore, the synergy of MW and GO is a promising technique for a cost-competitive biodiesel production from low-cost feedstocks containing high free fatty acids."
"Seismic capacity of masonry infilled RC frame strengthening with expanded metal ferrocement  2017 Elsevier LtdThis research was to investigate the behavior of masonry infilled reinforced concrete frame strengthening with expanded metals under cyclic loading. In this study, a prototype frame was chosen from a three-story reinforced concrete building that was not designed for earthquake load. Three specimens were built to full scale of 1:1 ratio including, the reinforced concrete bare frame (BF), the brick masonry infilled frame (W) and the masonry infilled frame strengthening with an expanded metal sheet (W-SR). The specimens were tested under constant vertical load and cyclic lateral load. The infilled frame strengthening with expanded metal sheet (W-SR) provided the lateral strength, stiffness and energy dissipation capacity of 1.25, 1.26, 1.27 times those of the brick masonry infilled frame (W), respectively. An analytical model based on an equivalent strut was proposed for masonry infill panels. In this approach, the nonlinear behavior obtained from the masonry prism test results was employed to determine the lateral strength and stiffness of the masonry panel model. The hysteretic behavior of the infill panel and infilled frame was evaluated using a nonlinear structural analysis program, RUAUMOKO. The results of the hysteretic behavior were compared with the experimental results to validate the proposed model."
"Monitoring and controlling ovarian activity in wild felids  2017 Elsevier Inc.In the past decade, studies on reproductive biology, endocrinology, and assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) in the domestic cat have contributed to a lot of progress in conservation breeding of wild felids. However, the 36 species of the Felidae family have species- and individual-specific reproductive cycles and respond differently to exogenous hormones. Monitoring the ovarian cycle of wild felids can improve their natural breeding and maximize their reproductive success. Moreover, fundamental knowledge on the hormonal patterns of each feline species offers the opportunity to develop ARTs, particularly in threatened and endangered species. Currently, several ovarian activity control regimens have been established with higher precision for artificial insemination, oocyte aspiration and embryo transfer. In this review, we highlight the efforts made in ovarian control and its outcomes showing promising applications to enhance wild felid conservation. Currently, ovarian monitoring has been studied in two-thirds of the feline species with thorough reports on 16 species only. To increase the genetic diversity of shrinking populations of these wild felids there still is a critical need for better knowledge of feline reproductive biology. Sustained successes will be achieved by controlling several factors influencing pregnancy successes by natural and assisted breeding."
"Novel organic/inorganic hybrid flower-like structure of selenium nanoparticles stabilized by pullulan derivatives  2017We proudly present the first organic/inorganic hybrid pullulan/SeNPs hybrid microflower material obtained using a simple and bio-inspired strategy. The chemical structures of pullulan, folic acid decorated cationic pullulan (FA-CP) were designed for stabilizing selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). SeNPs stabilized by FA-CP hybrid microflowers were observed after the addition of a cysteine hydrochloride solution into the solution mixture of Na2SeO3 and FA-CP. We suggested that the concentrations of cysteine and FA-CP were the key factors for the formation of flower-like structure. In addition, the formation mechanism of the microflowers was tentatively identified as anisotropic hierarchical growth. The microflowers exhibited effective drug adsorption with the loading capacity of 142.2 mg g−1 for doxorubicin which was three times higher than that for the doxorubicin-loaded spherical SeNPs and showed more potent activity against cancer cells while showing less toxicity against normal cells. These data demonstrated that the microflower-like FA-CP/SeNPs structure could be a candidate anticancer drug template in drug delivery systems."
"Optimization of cinnamon oil nanoemulsions using phase inversion temperature method: Impact of oil phase composition and surfactant concentration  2017 Elsevier Inc.Essential oils, such as those isolated from cinnamon, are effective natural antimicrobial agents, but their utilization is limited by their low water-solubility. In this study, phase inversion temperature (PIT) was used to prepare cinnamon oil nanoemulsions. To this aim, it was hypothesized that cinnamon oil nanoemulsions could be fabricated by optimizing the oil phase composition and surfactant concentration of the system and their stability could be enhanced using a cooling-dilution method during the PIT. A mixture of cinnamon oil, non-ionic surfactant, and water was heated above the PIT of the system, and then rapidly cooled with continuous stirring, which led to the spontaneous generation of small oil droplets. The impact of oil phase composition and surfactant concentration on the formation and stability of the nanoemulsions was determined. Cinnamon oil nanoemulsions with the smallest mean droplet diameter (101 nm) were formed using 40:60 wt% of cinnamon oil and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) in the total lipid phase. Increasing surfactant concentration significantly decreased the mean droplet diameter of the nanoemulsions but did not alter their particle morphology. In addition, using the cooling-dilution method, the nanoemulsions were stable for at least 31 days when stored at 4 °C or 25 °C."
"Improving the microstructure and mechanical properties of Zr-Ti alloy by nickel addition  2017 Elsevier B.V.The microstructure and mechanical properties of (Zr-Ti)1-χNiχ(χ =0, 1, 3, and 5 wt.%) alloys were studied. With the addition of nickel (Ni), the phase composition of alloys changes from α phase to α phase + hexagonal close packed (hcp) C14 Laves-phase. The thickness of lamellar α phase decreases with increasing Ni content. Optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results indicated that C14 Laves-phase is formed on the boundary. The Zr-Ti-3wt.%Ni alloys exhibits better ultimate compressive strength and compressive plasticity (1715 MPa and 9.70%) than that of Zr-Ti alloys (1598 MPa and 12.40%). The decrease of the average thickness of the lamellar α-phases (from 0.183 μm to 0.065 μm) leads to the improvement of the strength of the alloy. Additionally, the solid solution strengthening and the second phase strengthening are also important reasons for the improvement of the strength."

"Key factors of low carbon development strategy for sustainable transport  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Cities become more vulnerable to climate change impacts causing by urbanization, economic growth, increasing of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. People who live in the cities have already been affected from the impacts in terms of socioeconomic and environmental aspects. Sustainable transport plays the key role in CO2 mitigation and contributes positive impacts on sustainable development for the cities. Several studies in megacities both in developed and developing countries support that mass transit system is an important transportation mode in CO2 mitigation and sustainable transport development. This paper aims to study key factors of low carbon development strategy for sustainable transport. The Bangkok Mass Rapid Transit System (MRT) located in Bangkok was the study area. Data collection was using semi-structured in-depth interview protocol with thirty respondents consisting of six groups i.e. governmental agencies, the MRT operators, consulting companies, international organizations, non-profit organizations, and experts. The research findings highlighted the major factors and supplemental elements composing of institution and technical capacity, institutional framework, policy setting and process, and plan of implementation that would support more effective strategic process for low carbon development strategy (LCDS) for sustainable transport. The study would highly recommend on readiness of institution and technical capacities, stakeholder mapping, high-level decision- makers participation, and a clear direction of the governmental policies that are strongly needed in achieving the sustainable transport."
"Confirmatory factor analysis of Post-Occupancy Evaluation Model (POEM) for sustainable neighborhood development  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The sustainable urban development growth in the ASEAN region has accelerated tremendously. More demand on the sustainable development has led to bigger market driven certified green neighborhood and buildings. However, there is a lack of post-occupancy evaluation study conducted in assessing the end-users perspective on the certified sustainable neighborhood development. This paper aims to investigate the end-users point of view on sustainable dimension pillar (SDP) adaptation based on environment dimension, social dimension and economic dimension using Post-Occupancy Evaluation Model (POEM) framework. The research methodology employed stakeholders-Inclusion Approach survey questionnaires in order to obtained the sustainable dimensional adaptation score. The results show that there is sustainable dimension gap in POEM evaluation, hence, suggested the pre- occupancy criteria did not fulfill the SDP adaptation and pre-occupancy criteria and variables if differ from post-occupancy criteria and variables."
"Supramolecular Modulation of Structural Polymorphism in Pathogenic α-Synuclein Fibrils Using Copper(II) Coordination  2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimStructural variation of α-synuclein (αSyn) fibrils has been linked to the diverse etiologies of synucleinopathies. However, little is known about what specific mechanism provides αSyn fibrils with pathologic features. Herein, we demonstrate Cu(II)-based supramolecular approach for unraveling the formation process of pathogenic αSyn fibrils and its application in a neurotoxic mechanism study. The conformation of αSyn monomer was strained by macrochelation with Cu(II), thereby disrupting the fibril elongation while promoting its nucleation. This non-canonical process formed shortened, β-sheet enriched αSyn fibrils (<0.2 μm) that were rapidly transmitted and accumulated to neuronal cells, causing neuronal cell death, in sharp contrast to typical αSyn fibrils (ca. 1 μm). Our approach provided the supramolecular basis for the formation of pathogenic fibrils through physiological factors, such as brain Cu(II)."
"Search for the pair production of third-generation squarks with two-body decays to a bottom or charm quark and a neutralino in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The AuthorResults are presented from a search for the pair production of third-generation squarks in proton–proton collision events with two-body decays to bottom or charm quarks and a neutralino, which produces a significant imbalance in the transverse momentum. The search is performed using a sample of proton–proton collision data at s=13TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. No statistically significant excess of events is observed beyond the expected contribution from standard model processes. Exclusion limits are set in the context of simplified models of bottom or top squark pair production. Models with bottom squark masses up to 1220 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for light neutralinos, and models with top squark masses of 510 GeV are excluded assuming that the mass splitting between the top squark and the neutralino is small."
"Search for Higgs boson pair production in events with two bottom quarks and two tau leptons in proton–proton collisions at s=13TeV  2018 The AuthorA search for the production of Higgs boson pairs in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Events with one Higgs boson decaying into two bottom quarks and the other decaying into two τ leptons are explored to investigate both resonant and nonresonant production mechanisms. The data are found to be consistent, within uncertainties, with the standard model background predictions. For resonant production, upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section for Higgs boson pairs as a function of the hypothesized resonance mass and are interpreted in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. For nonresonant production, upper limits on the production cross section constrain the parameter space for anomalous Higgs boson couplings. The observed (expected) upper limit at 95% confidence level corresponds to about 30 (25) times the prediction of the standard model."
"Search for pair production of excited top quarks in the lepton + jets final state  2018 The Author(s)A search is performed for the pair production of spin-3/2 excited top quarks, each decaying to a top quark and a gluon. The search uses the data collected with the CMS detector from proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Events are selected by requiring an isolated muon or electron, an imbalance in the transverse momentum, and at least six jets of which exactly two must be compatible with originating from the fragmentation of a bottom quark. No significant excess over the standard model predictions is found. A lower limit of 1.2 TeV is set at 95% confidence level on the mass of the spin-3/2 excited top quark in an extension of the Randall–Sundrum model, assuming a 100% branching fraction of its decay into a top quark and a gluon. These are the best limits to date in a search for excited top quarks and the first at 13 TeV."
"Biodiesel production by a renewable catalyst from calcined Turbo jourdani (Gastropoda: Turbinidae) shells  2017 Elsevier LtdWaste gastropod shells and animal bones are one of the richest sources of calcium carbonate and have been utilized, after suitable treatment, for various applications. The outer lip of waste Turbo jourdani (Turbinidae) shells, a marine snail, was utilized as a raw material for the production of a porous calcium oxide (CaO) catalyst for biodiesel (as fatty acid methyl esters; FAME) production via transesterification of palm oil and methanol. The outer lip of the shell was calcined at 900 °C for 5 h to fully convert the shell (aragonite form of calcium carbonate) into CaO with a porous structure, as characterized and confirmed by thermogravimetric, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Three key reaction parameters: catalyst concentration, methanol: oil molar ratio and reaction time were optimized in terms of maximizing the oil to FAME conversion level. The best conditions were found to be a catalyst concentration of 10 wt%, a 3:1 methanol: oil molar ratio and a 7 h reaction time to give a >99% oil to FAME conversion level. Evaluation of the reusability of the catalyst revealed that its efficiency decreased with each sequential use but that a >90% conversion level was still obtained after eight sequential uses before it then declined markedly."
"Expanding the oro-dental and mutational spectra of kabuki syndrome and expression of KMT2D and KDM6A in human tooth germs  Ivyspring International Publisher.Kabuki syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinct dysmorphic facial features, intellectual disability, and multiple developmental abnormalities. Despite more than 350 documented cases, the oro-dental spectrum associated with kabuki syndrome and expression of KMT2D (histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D) or KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) genes in tooth development have not been well defined. Here, we report seven unrelated Thai patients with Kabuki syndrome having congenital absence of teeth, malocclusion, high-arched palate, micrognathia, and deviated tooth shape and size. Exome sequencing successfully identified that six patients were heterozygous for mutations in KMT2D, and one in KDM6A. Six were novel mutations, of which five were in KMT2D and one in KDM6A. They were truncating mutations including four frameshift deletions and two nonsense mutations. The predicted non-functional KMT2D and KDM6A proteins are expected to cause disease by haploinsufficiency. Our study expands oro-dental, medical, and mutational spectra associated with Kabuki syndrome. We also demonstrate for the first time that KMT2D and KDM6A are expressed in the dental epithelium of human tooth germs."
"Quality control process improvement of flexible printed circuit board by FMEA  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This research focuses on the quality control process improvement of Flexible Printed Circuit Board (FPCB), centred around model 7-Flex, by using Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method to decrease proportion of defective finished goods that are found at the final inspection process. Due to a number of defective units that were found at the final inspection process, high scraps may be escaped to customers. The problem comes from poor quality control process which is not efficient enough to filter defective products from in-process because there is no In-Process Quality Control (IPQC) or sampling inspection in the process. Therefore, the quality control process has to be improved by setting inspection gates and IPCQs at critical processes in order to filter the defective products. The critical processes are analysed by the FMEA method. IPQC is used for detecting defective products and reducing chances of defective finished goods escaped to the customers. Reducing proportion of defective finished goods also decreases scrap cost because finished goods incur higher scrap cost than work in-process. Moreover, defective products that are found during process can reflect the abnormal processes; therefore, engineers and operators should timely solve the problems. Improved quality control was implemented for 7-Flex production lines from July 2017 to September 2017. The result shows decreasing of the average proportion of defective finished goods and the average of Customer Manufacturers Lot Reject Rate (%LRR of CMs) equal to 4.5% and 4.1% respectively. Furthermore, cost saving of this quality control process equals to 100K Baht."
"Transportation of part supply improvement in agricultural machinery assembly plant  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This research focused on the problem caused by the transportation of part supply in agricultural machinery assembly plant in Thailand, which is one of the processes that are critical to the whole production process. If poorly managed, it will affect transportation of part supply, the emergence of sink cost, quality problems, and the ability to respond to the needs of the customers in time. Since the competition in the agricultural machinery market is more intense, the efficiency of part transportation process has to be improved. In this study, the process of transporting parts of the plant was studied and it was found that the efficiency of the process of transporting parts from the sub assembly line to its main assembly line was 83%. The approach to the performance improvement is done by using the Lean tool to limit wastes based on the ECRS principle and applying pull production system by changing the transportation method to operate as milkrun for transportation of parts to synchronize with the part demands of the main assembly line. After the transportation of parts from sub-Assembly line to the main assembly line was improved, the efficiency raised to 98% and transportation process cost was saved to 540,000 Baht per year."

"Tenofovir versus placebo to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B Copyright  2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.BACKGROUND Pregnant women with an elevated viral load of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have a risk of transmitting infection to their infants, despite the infants' receiving hepatitis B immune globulin. METHODS In this multicenter, double-blind clinical trial performed in Thailand, we randomly assigned hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive pregnant women with an alanine aminotransferase level of 60 IU or less per liter to receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or placebo from 28 weeks of gestation to 2 months post partum. Infants received hepatitis B immune globulin at birth and hepatitis B vaccine at birth and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary end point was a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive status in the infant, confirmed by the HBV DNA level at 6 months of age. We calculated that a sample of 328 women would provide the trial with 90% power to detect a difference of at least 9 percentage points in the transmission rate (expected rate, 3% in the TDF group vs. 12% in the placebo group). RESULTS From January 2013 to August 2015, we enrolled 331 women; 168 women were randomly assigned to the TDF group and 163 to the placebo group. At enrollment, the median gestational age was 28.3 weeks, and the median HBV DNA level was 8.0 log10 IU per milliliter. Among 322 deliveries (97% of the participants), there were 319 singleton births, two twin pairs, and one stillborn infant. The median time from birth to administration of hepatitis B immune globulin was 1.3 hours, and the median time from birth to administration of hepatitis B vaccine was 1.2 hours. In the primary analysis, none of the 147 infants (0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 2) in the TDF group were infected, as compared with 3 of 147 (2%; 95% CI, 0 to 6) in the placebo group (P = 0.12). The rate of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. The incidence of a maternal alanine aminotransferase level of more than 300 IU per liter after discontinuation of the trial regimen was 6% in the TDF group and 3% in the placebo group (P = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS In a setting in which the rate of mother-to-child HBV transmission was low with the administration of hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers, the additional maternal use of TDF did not result in a significantly lower rate of transmission.

"ORR activity and stability of PtCr/C catalysts in a low temperature/pressure PEM fuel cell: Effect of heat treatment temperature  2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCA series of PtCr/C catalysts was prepared by chemical reduction via the seeding/impregnation technique using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the reducing agent and then treated at different temperatures in the range of 500–900 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 2 h at ambient pressure. The effect of heat treatment on the catalyst morphology, oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability in a low temperature/pressure proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell was explored. Increasing the heat treatment temperature within this range increased the degree of alloying, particle sizes, Cr content and in-plane conductivity, but diminished the catalyst dispersion and the electrochemical surface area of all the PtCr/C catalysts. Among all the prepared PtCr/C catalysts, that heat-treated catalyst at 500 °C (PtCr/C-500) was the most promising catalyst for the ORR in a PEM fuel cell under a H2/O2 environment, considered in terms of the catalytic activity and stability."
"Assessing the reactogenicity of Tdap vaccine administered during pregnancy and antibodies to Bordetella pertussis antigens in maternal and cord sera of Thai women  2018 Elsevier LtdIntroduction: Pregnant Thai women have low antibody titers against B. pertussis antigens, which coincide with an increasing incidence of pertussis among Thai infants. Thus, there exists a potential benefit of a booster dose of tetanus- diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine administered during pregnancy. Here, we report the vaccine reactogenicity profile and birth outcomes in Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women who have or have not had prior immunization with tetanus vaccine, and the IgG levels to B. pertussis antigens in maternal and cord sera at delivery. Materials and methods: Pregnant women (N = 370) aged 18–40 years were administered the Tdap vaccine (Boostrix® GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) at 26–36 weeks gestation. Adverse events following vaccination were identified by follow-up telephone call and medical record review. IgG against pertussis toxin (anti-PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (anti-FHA) and pertactin (anti-PRN) in both maternal and umbilical cord blood obtained at delivery were quantitatively evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EUROIMMUN® Lübeck, Germany). Results: There was no reported increase in the severity or duration of adverse events associated with the administration of an extra tetanus-containing vaccine within the previous five years (N = 181) or multiple doses of tetanus-containing vaccines during the current pregnancy (N = 98). Vaccination at least eight weeks prior to delivery resulted in high antibody titers to all B. pertussis antigens studied. Conclusions: The reactogenicity of Tdap vaccine administered during pregnancy was not affected by prior tetanus toxoid immunization. High transplacental antibody against B. pertussis antigens in the cord blood provides evidence of antibody transfer and should thus help to protect newborns from pertussis during early life."
"Phonetic and systemic biases in tonal contour changes in Bangkok Thai  2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston. All rights reserved.Understanding phonetic and systemic motivation is a crucial element in the study of sound change. However, our understanding is largely limited to segmental changes. Working within the phonetically-based approach to sound change, this article accounts for the tonal contour changes in Bangkok Thai during the 20th century in terms of biases that exist in human speech. It proposes that the changes are explicable by known patterns of phonetic variation and systemic constraints that introduce biases into the process of phonologization. In this account, the tonal contour changes, like most cases of segmental changes, can be regarded as linguistically-motivated."
"Co-existence of the double inferior vena cava with complex interiliac venous communication and aberrant common hepatic artery arising from superior mesenteric artery: A case report Copyright  2018 Via Medica.Variations of the arterial and venous system of the abdomen and pelvis have important clinical significance in hepatobiliary surgery, abdominal laparoscopy, and radiological intervention. A case of double inferior vena cava (IVC) with complex interiliac communication and variation of the common hepatic artery (CHA) arising from superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in a 79-year-old male cadaver is presented. Both IVCs ascended on either side of the abdominal aorta. The left-sided IVC crossed anterior to the aorta at the level of the left renal vein. The union of both IVCs was at the level just above the right renal vein. The diameter of right-sided IVC, left-sided IVC and the common IVC were 16.73 mm, 21.57 mm and 28.75 mm, respectively. In the pelvic cavity, the right common iliac vein was formed by a union of right external and internal iliac veins while the formation of left common iliac vein was from the external iliac vein and two internal iliac veins. An interiliac vein ran from right internal iliac vein to left common iliac vein with an additional communicating vein running from the middle of this interiliac vein to the right common iliac vein. Another co-existence variation in this case was the origin of the CHA arising from the SMA with a suprapancreatic retroportal course. Clinical importance of double IVC are observed in retroperitoneal surgery, whole organ transplantation or radical nephrectomy, surgical ligation of the IVC or the placement of an IVC filter for thromboembolic disease. The variation of CHA has an important clinical significance in liver transplantation, abdominal laparoscopy and radiological abdominal intervention."
"Urethane-Linked Imidazole-Cellulose Microcrystals: Synthesis and Their Dual Functions in Adsorption and Naked Eye Sensing with Colorimetric Enhancement of Metal Ions Copyright  2018 American Chemical Society.In this work, we demonstrate a simple approach to synthesize urethane-linked imidazole-cellulose microcrystals (U-ICMs) for simultaneous adsorption and naked eye sensing of metal ions. The synthesis is based on surface chemical modification of cellulose microcrystals (CMCs) by 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole and 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole, respectively. The adsorption and sensing of U-ICMs and CMCs in response to diverse metal ions (Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, and Cd2+) are qualitatively and quantitatively elucidated by UV-vis spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The U-ICMs exhibit high performance for most metal species adsorption including Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, and Cd2+, while CMCs favor Fe3+ adsorption. Comparing the adsorption performance of CMCs and U-ICMs, the presence of urethane-linked imidazole on CMCs leads to an improvement of adsorption capacity of more than 3 times (for Zn2+) up to 23 times (for Ni2+). At the same time, the adsorption of metals on U-ICMs promotes an enrichment of metal colors that can be clearly observed by the naked eye and UV-vis spectroscopic data. XPS and X-ray absorption near-edge structure are investigated to prove how those metal ions transform after exposure to the unmodified and modified CMCs surface. The findings highlight the potential use of U-ICMs together with CMCs as sustainable bioadsorbents and sensing materials for metal separation and water purification."
"Serum lipids as an indicator for the alteration of liver function in patients with hepatitis B  2018 The Author(s).Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) exerts an intense impact on host lipid metabolism. Hence the aim of present study is to determine metabolic derangement that occurred in subjects suffering from hepatitis B patients. Methods: The fasting blood samples were collected from hepatitis B patients (n = 50) attended in Taluka hospital TandoAdam, Sindh with age and gender matched controls (n = 50). Serum lipid profile and fatty acid (FA) composition were analyzed by micro-lab and gas chromatography. Results: The hepatitis B patients have significantly lower level (p < 0.01) of lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC), triacylglyceride (TAG), high density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and total lipid (TL) in comparison to controls, indicating hypolipidemia in patients. The result of total FA composition of HBV patients in comparison to controls reveal that myristic, palmitic, docosahexaenoic acids were significantly (p < 0.05) higher, while linoleic, eicosatrienoic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic acids were lower in HBV patients in comparison to controls. The elongase, Δ5 and Δ6-desaturase enzymes activities were found lower, while Δ9-desaturase activity was higher in hepatitis B patients as compared to controls, which indicates the impaired lipid metabolism. Conclusion: The serum saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) were increased while polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was reduced in both total and free form in hepatitis B patients due to altered activities of enzyme desaturases with impaired PUFA metabolism and non-enzymatic oxidation."
"Poly(butyl acrylate-co-fluorinated acrylate)-graft-natural rubber: Synthesis and application as compatibilizer for natural rubber/poly(butyl acrylate-co-fluorinated acrylate) films  2017 Elsevier B.V.Poly(butyl acrylate-co-fluorinated acrylate)-graft-natural rubber was successfully prepared via emulsion graft copolymerization and applied as a compatibilizer for improving phase compatibility and toughness of natural rubber/poly(butyl acrylate-co-fluorinated acrylate) films. From graft copolymerization step, butyl acrylate (BA) acted as a co-monomer to be initially grafted onto the natural rubber (NR) and then copolymerized with 2,2,2–trifluoroethyl methacrylate (3FMA) to form a grafting poly(BA-co-3FMA) chain onto the NR backbone. The appropriated BA/3FMA ratio at 30/70 (w/w) provided the highest graft copolymer fraction of 72.8 wt% with 25.3 mol% grafted 3FMA and 68.5% grafting efficiency under center reaction condition. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that the graft product had core-shell morphology, which NR was a core and covered by poly(BA-co-3FMA) shell. The results from Molau test and atomic force microscopy showed that the addition of 5–10 wt% graft product could enhance the compatibility between NR and poly(BA-co-3FMA) phases in the NR/poly(BA-co-3FMA) films (20/80 (w/w)) and provided the obtained films with a greater elongation at break to 266% than that of poly(BA-co-3FMA) film (27%). The compatibilized films also exhibited a high hydrophobicity (water contact angle = 109°) and oleophobicity (hexadecane contact angle = 54°) with a low surface energy (8.04 mN/m), which can be further applied as self-sealing films for moisture and oil protection."

"Effects of water table fluctuation on diesel fuel migration in one-dimensional laboratory study  2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The effects of water table fluctuation on diesel fuel redistribution in unsaturated soil are investigated in the laboratory by one-dimensional column test. The simplified image analysis method is used to assess the saturation distributions of water and diesel in the flow domain under transient condition. The experiments are undertaken on two homogeneous sands to study the effects of different particle sizes. The two-phase experimental data illustrate soil–liquid characteristic curves (SLCCs) of water/air and diesel/air systems. The SLCCs of diesel/water systems can be predicted by scaling procedure. A descending order of matric suction at a given saturation of wetting phase is in the order of air/water, diesel/water and air/diesel systems. Coarser particle size gives smaller entry pressure, residual matric suction and residual degree of saturation. The three-phase (air/water/diesel) experimental data illustrate that, during imbibition stages, air and diesel are entrapped below water table with the entrapped air saturations of 18–24% and entrapped diesel saturations of 6–10% for fine sand. Coarser particle size yields smaller entrapped diesel saturations and larger entrapped air saturations. The residual diesel saturations during drainage stages and entrapped diesel saturations during imbibition stages do not show any systematic difference as these stages are repeated. During imbibition stages, 37–47% of the total amount of diesel fuel is entrapped under the water table. Also, there is no systematic difference in the amount of diesel fuel entrapped under the water table when imbibition stages are repeated."
"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery of brain metastases from neuroendocrine tumors  Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Neuro-Oncology and the European Association of Neuro-Oncology. All rights reserved.Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established treatment for brain metastases, yet little is known about SRS for neuroendocrine tumors given their unique natural history. Objective: To determine outcomes and toxicity from SRS in patients with brain metastases arising from neuroendocrine tumors. Methods: Thirty-three patients with brain metastases from neuroendocrine tumors who underwent SRS were retrospectively reviewed. Median age was 61 years and median Karnofsky performance status was 80. Primary sites were lung (87.9%), cervix (6.1%), esophagus (3%), and prostate (3%). Ten patients (30.3%) received upfront SRS, 7 of whom had neuroendocrine tumors other than small cell lung carcinoma. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine prognostic factors for survival. Results: With median follow-up after SRS of 5.3 months, local and distant brain recurrence developed in 5 patients (16.7%) and 20 patients (66.7%), respectively. Median overall survival (OS) after SRS was 6.9 months. Patients with progressive disease per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria at 4 to 6 weeks after SRS had shorter median time to developing recurrence at a distant site in the brain and shorter OS than patients without progressive disease: 1.4 months and 3.3 months vs 11.4 months and 12 months, respectively (both P < .001). Toxicity was more likely in lesions of small cell histology than in lesions of other neuroendocrine tumor histology, 15.7% vs 3.3% (P = .021). No cases of grade 3 to 5 necrosis occurred. Conclusions: SRS is an effective treatment option for patients with brain metastases from neuroendocrine tumors with excellent local control despite slightly higher toxicity rates than expected. Progressive disease at 4 to 6 weeks after SRS portends a poor prognosis."

"Update of multimodal pain management strategies for total knee arthroplasty  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Total knee arthroplasty [TKA] has traditionally been one of the most painful orthopedic procedures. Postoperative pain control in the past depended on high doses of opioids, resulting in dizziness and nausea, delayed ambulation, and prolonged hospital stays. Over the last decade, multimodal pain control has been developed that provides excellent pain control and reduces opioid consumption. The key principle is the use of a variety of interventions that affect different sites in the pain pathway. Multimodal pain management for TKA includes preemptive analgesia, regional anesthesia, and local infiltrative anesthesia (periarticular injection) as well as various oral and intravenous pain medications such as NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, and gabapentinoids. The goal ofthis review is to provide an update of current knowledge ofmultimodal pain management for TKA."
"Patients’ real life experience in using glucosamine sulfate for treatment of knee osteoarthritis under the comptroller general’s department (CGD) reimbursement protocol: A preliminary report  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Knee osteoarthritis [OA] is one of the most common orthopedic diseases in Thailand. Glucosamine sulfate is an option for treatment of mild to moderate knee OA; however, this optional treatment has been restricted under the reimbursement protocol of the Comptroller General’s Department [CGD]. The objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate both patient-reported and performance-based benefits of glucosamine for the treatment of knee OA when administered as specified by the CGD reimbursement protocol. Materials and Methods: We prospectively evaluated 100 knee OA patients who had been prescribed glucosamine sulfate and met CGD criteria for reimbursement. Outcomes of treatment were evaluated using conventional subjective measurements, including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC], visual analog scale [VAS] for pain, and the Short form-12 [SF-12]. In addition, all patients had to complete two functional performance measures, the Timed Up and Go Test [TUGT] and the 5-time sit to stand [5XSST]. Measurements of all parameters were performed at pretreatment then again at week 6,12, and 18. Results: Patients were divided in to into 3 groups according to Kellgren and Lawrence system: mild OA (KL 1), moderate OA (KL 2-3), and severe OA (KL 4) in accordance with the CGD reimbursement protocol. At the 18-week follow-up [FU], 57 of the 100 patients (50 females and 7 males) had completed evaluations of all parameters. Fifteen of the 57 patients were in the mild group (KL 1), 32 were in the moderate group (KL 2-3), and 10 were in the severe group (KL 4). The patients’ mean age was 68.28 years, and the mean BMI was 26.03 kg/m2. At the 18-week FU, values of all investigated parameters had significantly improved. However, improvement of the conventional clinical subjective parameters occurred later than those of objective functional performance, including TUGT improved from week 6; VAS, SF-12 (PCS), and 5XSST from week 12; and WOMAC and SF-12 (MCS) from week 18. Conclusion: At the 18-week FU, glucosamine sulfate treatment of knee OA administered following the CGD reimbursement protocol results in improvement in all evaluated parameters, especially performance-based measurements, which had no patient or surgeon bias. Whilst significant improvement was detected from week 6, at week 12, most of them were detected. Therefore, the results of this preliminary study supported the CGD reimbursement protocol, which defines that physicians have to evaluate the outcomes oftreatment after 12 weeks."
"Effectiveness of E-Learning with fifth-year medical students studying metabolic bone diseases  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: E-learning is a tool for enhancing knowledge which can potentially increase medical students’ ability to learn and understand complex subjects. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of e-learning in increasing understanding of metabolic bone diseases by medical students during their orthopaedic rotation. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Orthopaedics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital. Fifth-year medical students doing their rotation in the Orthopedics Department between August 2012 and July 2013 were enrolled in the study. All participants were instructed to study metabolic bone diseases using a lesson plan, handouts, and a textbook. They were also given the opportunity to volunteer to participate in an e-learning class prior to attending a one-hour case-based lecture. Students who missed the class were excluded from the present study. Baseline characteristics, in-class scores, multiple choice question [MCQ] grades, and orthopaedic grades of the participants were collected. Associations between study factors and outcomes were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Results: A total of 154 medical students were included in the study. Their average age was 23 years, and 57% were female. Only 12 (8%) participated in the voluntary e-learning class. The e-learning group had higher in-class scores (9.00±0.95) compared to the non e-learning group (7.70±1.30) withp-value = 0.001. Cumulative GPA and participation in the voluntary e-learning class were factors included in the multiple regression analysis. After adjusting for cumulative GPA, attendance at the e-learning class was significantly associated with in-class scores (coefficient 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.43, 1.96, p-value = 0.002). Participation in the e-learning class was not significantly correlated with either MCQ grades or orthopaedic grades. Conclusion: E-learning as an adjunct to traditional teaching methods can increase knowledge about metabolic bone disorders among medical students, but it does not affect either MCQ grades or orthopaedic grades."
"The validation and evaluation of anti-HIV testing algorithm used in mobile clinic setting for men who have sex with men in metropolitan Bangkok, Thailand  2018, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand. All rights reserved. Background: Same-day anti-HIV testing algorithm is recommended by Thai National Guidelines. We compared performance characteristics of algorithms used in a mobile clinic and a facility-based clinic for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Bangkok. Methods: Mobile clinic samples collected from 4 saunas and 2 spa venues were tested by Alere Determine™ HIV 1/2, followed by DoubleCheck Gold™ Ultra HIV 1/2 and SD Bioline HIV 1/2 3.0. All samples were re-tested at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRCAC) by Architect HIV Ag/Ab or Elecsys HIV combi PT, followed by Alere Determine™ HIV 1/2 and Serodia HIV 1/2. Non-reactive samples were tested by Aptima nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and reactive/inconclusive samples were tested by less-sensitive immunoassays (IA) and HIV-1 RNA to detect acute HIV infection (positive NAAT or non-reactive IA/positive HIV-1 RNA). Results: Of 233 MSM, 36 (15.5%) had HIV infection diagnosed using mobile clinic algorithm. Two additional acute HIV cases (1 positive NAAT and 1 reactive Architect with detectable HIV-1 RNA) were diagnosed using TRCAC algorithm. The mobile clinic algorithm had a sensitivity of 94.9% (95% CI: 82.7, 99.4) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 98.1, 100). Conclusion: Use of whole blood on rapid test kits demonstrated satisfactory performance and allowed same-day HIV test result through a mobile clinic model. For populations with high HIV incidence, careful history taking to define the window period is crucial and repeat testing must be encouraged if the testing algorithm does not include 4 th generation anti-HIV assay or NAAT."
"Bat guano as the component of fertilizer or the health hazard?  2018, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved.Phosphorus is an important element for life since to it is the component of human and animal bodies and it is the composition of plant, the food of human and some animals. Fertilizer is compose of phosphorus, the limited element in the current situation that is also the vital mineral for agricultural sector. Although phosphorus can be extracted from phosphate rock, the quality and quantity may be not enough for using the global scale. The new sources of phosphorus are now from waste and wastewater recovery or guano extraction. Bat guano is rich in phosphate, but it is also the cause of the outbreak of zoonoses through inhalation of fungal spores Histoplasma capsulatum, the health hazard that can cause various losses for humans. Policies must be made to solve the health problem from bat guano harvesting to replace the use of phosphate rock with the integrated collaboration of all relevant parties. The objective of this review is to give information nowadays about the realization of phosphorus scarcity, to manifest the advantage of bat guano as phosphorus source and also as histoplasmosis outbreak for making the decision of whether to use bat guano or not in phosphorus inadequacy issue as well as to present the safety and security policies for bat guano collection in case of bat guano will be used as phosphorus source."
"The influence of neighbor effect and urbanization toward organ donation in Thailand  2017, NATCO. All rights reserved.Introduction: Toward population wellness, an extreme scarcity of organ supply is proven to be an enormous hindrance. Preferences toward organ donation are vital to raise the organ donation rate. Notably, the area people live in can address the social influence on individual preference toward organ donation. Research Questions: This article studies the impact of the neighbor effect on organ donation decisions, addressing the social influence of urbanization on preferences. How neighborhoodspecific variables, population density, and socioeconomic status drive the neighbor effect is investigated. The pursuit of organ donor traits is to be answered. Design: The study uses organ donation interview survey data and neighborhood-specific data from Thailand to estimate a series of logistic regression models. Results: Individuals residing in urban areas exhibit a greater likelihood to sign the donor card than those in rural areas. The neighborhood socioeconomic status is the key driver. An individual is more willing to be an organ donor when having neighbors with higher socioeconomic statuses. Results also reveal positive influences of males and education on the organ donation rate. Discussion: This article documents the “neighbor effect” on the organ donation decision via living area type, offering an alternative exposition in raising the organ donation rate. In shifting the society norm toward organ donation consent, policy-makers should acknowledge the benefit of urbanization on organ donation decision derived from resourceful urban areas. Moreover, raising education levels does improve not only citizens’ well-being but also their tendency to exhibit an altruistic act toward others."
"Agreement of Anterior Segment Parameters Obtained From Swept-Source Fourier-Domain and Time-Domain Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography  2018 The Authors.PURPOSE. To assess the interdevice agreement between swept-source Fourier-domain and time-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). METHODS. Fifty-three eyes from 41 subjects underwent CASIA2 and Visante OCT imaging. One hundred eighty–degree axis images were measured with the built-in two-dimensional analysis software for the swept-source Fourier-domain AS-OCT (CASIA2) and a customized program for the time-domain AS-OCT (Visante OCT). In both devices, we examined the angle opening distance (AOD), trabecular iris space area (TISA), angle recess area (ARA), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber width (ACW), and lens vault (LV). Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation (ICC) were performed. Orthogonal linear regression assessed any proportional bias. RESULTS. ICC showed strong correlation for LV (0.925) and ACD (0.992) and moderate agreement for ACW (0.801). ICC suggested good agreement for all angle parameters (0.771– 0.878) except temporal AOD500 (0.743) and ARA750 (nasal 0.481; temporal 0.481). There was a proportional bias in nasal ARA750 (slope 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.95– 3.18), temporal ARA750 (slope 2.57, 95% CI: 2.04–3.40), and nasal TISA500 (slope 1.30, 95% CI: 1.12–1.54). Bland-Altman plots demonstrated in all measured parameters a minimal mean difference between the two devices ( 0.089 to 0.063); however, evidence of constant bias was found in nasal AOD250, nasal AOD500, nasal AOD750, nasal ARA750, temporal AOD500, temporal AOD750, temporal ARA750, and ACD. Among the parameters with constant biases, CASIA2 tends to give the larger numbers. CONCLUSIONS. Both devices had generally good agreement. However, there were proportional and constant biases in most angle parameters. Thus, it is not recommended that values be used interchangeably."
"Does heating up saline for nasal irrigation improve mucociliary function in chronic rhinosinusitis?  The Author(s) 2018.Background: Mucociliary function is affected by temperature. Exposure to cold air may impair ciliary beat frequency. While saline nasal irrigation improves in ciliary beat activity, there is no evidence supporting the use of heated saline irrigation in treating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Objective: To compare the effects of heated saline to room-temperature saline nasal irrigation on mucociliary clearance in chronic rhinosinusitis patients. Methods: Adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were randomized into two groups receiving either heated saline or room-temperature saline nasal irrigation. Healthy subjects were included as control. Saccharin transit time was measured before and after nasal irrigation. Nasal patency was assessed by peak nasal inspiratory flow, anterior rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, nasal obstruction score, and breathe-comfort score. Any adverse events were reported. Results: Twenty-three patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nine healthy subjects were enrolled. Saccharin transit time was decreased after nasal irrigation in both heated saline subgroup (baseline 12.3 ± 4.5 min vs. postirrigation 8.4 ± 4.9 min, p = 0.05) and room-temperature subgroup (baseline 12.8 ± 5.0 min vs. postirrigation 8.9 ± 4.2 min, p = 0.01). The saccharin transit time improvement was not different between heated saline (3.8 ± 6.2 min) and room-temperature saline (3.8 ± 4.0 min), p = 0.13. Postheated saline irrigation saccharin transit time of chronic rhinosinusitis patients (8.4 ± 4.9 min) was not different to healthy subjects (9.2 ± 3.7 min), p = 0.69. Nasal patency was not different between groups. There was no adverse event reported. Conclusion: Nasal saline irrigation is beneficial to patients with chronic rhinosinusitis on mucociliary improvement. Warming saline is not necessary and adds no additional benefit to room-temperature saline irrigation."

"Search for new phenomena in final states with two opposite-charge, same-flavor leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Search results are presented for physics beyond the standard model in final states with two opposite-charge, same-flavor leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. The analysis uses the invariant mass of the lepton pair, searching for a kinematic edge or a resonant-like excess compatible with the Z boson mass. The search for a kinematic edge targets production of particles sensitive to the strong force, while the resonance search targets both strongly and electroweakly produced new physics. The observed yields are consistent with the expectations from the standard model, and the results are interpreted in the context of simplified models of supersymmetry. In a gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) model of gluino pair production with decay chains including Z bosons, gluino masses up to 1500–1770 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level depending on the lightest neutralino mass. In a model of electroweak chargino-neutralino production, chargino masses as high as 610 GeV are excluded when the lightest neutralino is massless. In GMSB models of electroweak neutralino-neutralino production, neutralino masses up to 500-650 GeV are excluded depending on the decay mode assumed. Finally, in a model with bottom squark pair production and decay chains resulting in a kinematic edge in the dilepton invariant mass distribution, bottom squark masses up to 980–1200 GeV are excluded depending on the mass of the next-to-lightest neutralino."
"Search for natural supersymmetry in events with top quark pairs and photons in pp collisions at √s=8 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Results are presented from a search for natural gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) in a scenario in which the top squark is the lightest squark, the next-to-lightest SUSY particle is a bino-like neutralino, and the lightest SUSY particle is the gravitino. The strong production of top squark pairs can produce events with pairs of top quarks and neutralinos, with each bino-like neutralino decaying to a photon and a gravitino. The search is performed using a sample of pp collision data accumulated by the CMS experiment at s=8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1. The final state consists of a lepton (electron or muon), jets, and one or two photons. The imbalance in transverse momentum in the events is compared with the expected spectrum from standard model processes. No excess event yield is observed beyond the expected background, and the result is interpreted in the context of a general model of gauge-mediated SUSY breaking that leads to exclusion of top squark masses below 650–730 GeV.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Comparing transverse momentum balance of b jet pairs in pp and PbPb collisions at √sNN=5.02 TeV  2018, The Author(s).The transverse momentum balance of pairs of back-to-back b quark jets in PbPb and pp collisions recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC is reported. The center-of-mass energy in both collision systems is 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair. Compared to the pp collision baseline, b quark jets have a larger imbalance in the most central PbPb collisions, as expected from the jet quenching effect. The data are also compared to the corresponding measurement with inclusive dijets. In the most central collisions, the imbalance of b quark dijets is comparable to that of inclusive dijets.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Search for electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos in multilepton final states in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Results are presented from a search for the direct electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos in signatures with either two or more leptons (electrons or muons) of the same electric charge, or with three or more leptons, which can include up to two hadronically decaying tau leptons. The results are based on a sample of proton-proton collision data collected at s=13 TeV, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The observed event yields are consistent with the expectations based on the standard model. The results are interpreted in simplified models of supersymmetry describing various scenarios for the production and decay of charginos and neutralinos. Depending on the model parameters chosen, mass values between 180 GeV and 1150 GeV are excluded at 95% CL. These results significantly extend the parameter space probed for these particles in searches at the LHC. In addition, results are presented in a form suitable for alternative theoretical interpretations.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Correcting misidentifications and first confirmation of the globally-invasive Physa acuta Draparnaud, 1805 (Gastropoda: Physidae) in Thailand and Laos  2018 The Author(s). Journal compilation and 2018 REABIC.Introduced freshwater gastropods in the Indo-Burmese region may be under-documented owing to a lack of research attention. For the first time, we report on the widespread establishment of the globally invasive freshwater snail Physa acuta (Physidae) in Thailand and Laos, including decades old records that had previously been misidentified as Camptoceras jiraponi (Planorbidae). Occurrence of Physa acuta as hitchhikers among ornamental aquatic plants suggests that the ornamental trade was a likely introduction pathway of the species into Thailand. That a globally invasive species was able to spread unnoticed for such a long period of time highlights the need for countries like Thailand to focus research efforts on prevention and early detection of introduced species, in addition to increasing our understanding of native biodiversity."
"Life cycle cost analysis and energy performance of president’s office, prince of Songkla university, Thailand  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.The importance of life cycle cost analysis for administration is to investigate the components and activities which are outstanding engagements making high operational cost. This involves energy efficiency and consumption reduction from occupants in building. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost of operational performance in administrative buildings of Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Hatyai campus called President’s office (PO). It has a 6,988 m2 functional area including executive, administrative, and meeting operations. The highest cost of operation comes from electricity consumption estimated to be about 2,439,047 THB or 69,687 USD. To obtain the approximate energy performance of PO, energy audit was investigated. The primary operational energy was considered in four components;(1) Air-conditioning (AC) to cool the rooms, (2) Lighting to illuminate the rooms, (3) IT devices to process documents and database, and (4) auxiliary appliances to support administration. In particularly, AC system consumes the highest energy. Approximately 75% of the energy consumed in the building is attributed to administrative operations. This study also suggests some solutions that have been recorded to be effective in reducing the energy consumption of administrative building. The energy measures were divided into two different categories, reaching by internal and external factors. The most mutual recommendations were identified as lighting and air conditioning retrofits. Renewable energy is an environmental friendly solution but installation has been proved to cost higher than saving cost. Furthermore, there is still potential for improving energy performance not only by its physical characteristics but also by several significant factors such as occupant’s behavioral change, and control of indoor environmental condition. The energy efficiency improvement requires holistic measures for sustainable energy building."
"Pharmacognostic specification and mangiferin content of aquilaria crassna leaves  2018 Phcog.Net.Background: Aquilaria crassna Pierre ex Lecomte (Thymelaeaceae) has been used as a medicinal plant in many aspects. Previous research has revealed that A. crassna leaves contain mangiferin as an active compound. Although the active component has been investigated, the pharmacognostic specification and quantification of mangiferin from A. crassna leaves have never been established. Objective: The current study aimed to conduct and develop a pharmacognostic standard according to WHO guidance as well as the validated method for quantifying mangiferin content. Materials and Methods: Dried A. crassna leaves from 15 separated locations throughout Thailand were investigated for pharmacognostic specification. Their mangiferin contents were quantitatively analysed by TLC densitometry with winCATS software. Results: Macroscopic-, microscopic- characteristics and TLC fingerprinting combined with physicochemical parameters were reported in this study. The loss on drying, moisture content, and total ash content as well as acid-insoluble ash content were determined to be 8.62 ± 0.13, 8.16 ± 0.14, 6.82 ± 0.09 and 1.49 ± 0.03%, respectively. Ethanol- and water-extractive values were found to be 9.05 ± 0.39 and 16.94 ± 0.22 %, respectively. In addition, the validation method for quantifying the mangiferin content was developed. The contents of mangiferin in A. crassna leaf extract determined by TLC-densitometry and TLC-image analysis were found to be 1.2992 ± 0.5980 and 1.3036 ± 0.5874 % by dried weight, respectively. The results between these two analytical methods were shown to have an insignificant difference. Conclusion: This study provides the necessary information for authentication and standardisation of A. crassna leaves."
"Green diesel production through simultaneous deoxygenation of palmitic acid and desulfurization of 4,6-Dimethyl-dibenzothiophene over commercial CoMo/Al2O3  2018 BRTeam.This study investigated the deoxygenation of palmitic acid as a model compound of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), in the presence of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene as a sulfur-containing light gas oil (LGO). Reactions were performed at the pressure of 25 barg, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 1.7 h-1, and H2/oil of 630 NL/L over CoMo/Al2O3 as catalyst. The effect of temperature was studied in the range of 275-300 °C. Both deoxygenation and desulfurization led to approximately 100% conversions at 300 °C, while at 275 °C, palmitic acid deoxygenation was recorded at a higher conversion rate compared with that of the desulfurization of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene. The presence of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene during the deoxygenation of palmitic acid resulted in high conversions (>95%). Pressure drop studies showed that the formation of heavy products caused a gradual pressure drop throughout the reactor over time. The catalyst was deactivated during 10 d. Two different sulfur-containing reagents were used for catalyst reactivation including dimethyl-disulfide in n-C18 and LGO containing 484 ppmw of sulfur. Reactivation with 2 wt.% of dimethyl-disulfide in n-C18 at 320 °C for 36 h led to more favrable performance recovery vs. the sulfur-containing LGO."
"Effect of thermal processing and ingredients on egg yolk quality  2018, University of Agriculture. All rights reserved.The research aims to understand how heat and added ingredients influence the properties of egg yolk which in turn impact the stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Apparent viscosity and Zeta potential of egg yolk dispersion, interfacial tension between rice bran oil and water, oil droplet size and confocal microscope image of each emulsion were investigated. The confocal microscope images of emulsions clearly show that the adsorbed protein layer was thickest when the egg yolk was heated at 65°C for 9 min and a salt-sugar-vinegar mixture was used. Thus, this condition could stabilize an oil-in-water emulsion by preventing the coalescence of oil droplets."
"Comparison of adductor canal block versus local infiltration analgesia on postoperative pain and functional outcome after total knee arthroplasty: A randomized controlled trial  2018, Malaysian Orthopaedic Association. All rights reserved.Introduction: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with intense postoperative pain for which effective analgesia is essential to facilitate early postoperative recovery. Adductor canal block (ACB) and local infiltration analgesia (LIA) have become increasingly involved in postoperative pain management after TKA. We aimed to compare their efficacy and outcomes in patients undergoing TKA. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized to receive either postoperative single-injection ACB (Group A) or LIA (Group L) during the operation. All patients received spinal anaesthesia. Primary outcome was total morphine consumption over postoperative 24 hours. Visual analog pain scale, time to first and total dosage of rescue analgesia, performance-based evaluations [timed-up and go (TUG) test, quadriceps strength], side-effects, length of hospital stay and patient satisfaction were measured. Results: Fifty-seven patients were available for analysis. Median total morphine consumption over 24 and 48 postoperative hours of Group A were significantly less than Group L (6/10 mg vs 13/25 mg, p, 0.008 and 0.001, respectively). Similarly, Group A had significantly lower VAS at postoperative 6, 12 and 18 hours, VAS at ambulation on postoperative (POD) 1-3, better TUG tests on POD 2 and during POD 3 than those of Group L. However, quadriceps strength and patient satisfaction were not different between both groups. Conclusion: Patients undergoing TKA with single-injection ACB required less postoperative opioids than those with LIA. Furthermore, multimodal analgesia using ACB provided better postoperative analgesia, as well as performance-based activities, than those with LIA."
"Estimation of aloe-emodin content in cassia grandis and cassia garrettiana leaves using tlc densitometric method and TLC image analysis � 2018 OMICS International. All rights reserved.Plants in genus Cassia contain anthraquinones that possess stimulant laxative property. Cassia grandis L.f. and Cassia garrettiana Craib have been widely distributed throughout Thailand as Thai herbal medicine and ornamental plant. The objective of this study was to develop and validate TLC densitometry and TLC image analysis for quantitative analysis of aloe-emodin content in Cassia grandis and Cassia garrettiana leaves. The fresh mature leaves of Cassia grandis and Cassia garrettiana, collected from 15 locations throughout Thailand were successively extracted with dichloromethane. Silica gel 60 GF254 was used as a stationary phase and hexane-ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) was used as the mobile phase. Aloe-emodin contents estimated using TLC densitometry and TLC image analysis in Cassia grandis dried crude drug were 0.4122±0.0668 and 0.4130±0.0751 g % and Cassia garrettiana dried crude drug were 0.0346±0.0067 and 0.0351±0.0056 g %, respectively. The method was validated in terms of calibration range, accuracy, repeatability and intermediate precision, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, specificity and robustness. A statistical comparison of the quantitative analysis using TLC densitometry and TLC image analysis of aloe-emodin in Cassia grandis and Cassia garrettiana leaves were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Both validated methods can be used for evaluation of aloe-emodin contents in Cassia grandis and Cassia garrettiana leaves."
Between polygyny and monogamy: Marriages of the political elite and the Thai regime of images  2018 ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.The polygynous marriages of Thai kings traditionally fulfilled a range of vital political functions. Comparison between those marriages and the marriages of politicians active in the post-1932 constitutional regime era illustrate the continuing political significance of marriage in Thailand. Polygyny has become highly contextualized with different sections of Thai society operating according to varying marital norms. Performative monogamy is thus necessary. This situation suggests weaknesses in the Thai regime of images as it relates to the notional separation between public and private spheres and to the idea of multiple truths. Neither applies to the marriages of members of the Thai political elite.
"Transcriptome analysis of ABCB1, ABCG2 and the BCL2/BAX ratio in refractory and relapsed canine lymphomas under treatment and rescue protocol  2008 Walter de Gruyter GmbH. All rights reserved.The main problems that cause unresponsiveness to an anti-neoplastic drug are the overexpression of drug resistant and anti-apoptotic proteins in tumor cells. In a rescue protocol we evaluated the ability of toceranib phosphate concurrent with lomustine (CCNU) or L-asparaginase and vincristine to decrease drug resistant and apoptotic proteins in relapsed and refractory canine lymphomas. The peripheral blood samples were collected before and after the rescue treatment from fourteen dogs that were refractory to cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisolone (COP) or COP-doxorubicin (CHOP) treatment and had recurrent multicentric lymphoma. The mRNA expression level of ABCB1, ABCG2, Bcl2 and Bax were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The fold-change in ABCB1, ABCG2, Bcl2 and Bax mRNA levels were analyzed in correlation with the progression-free survival (PFS). After the rescue treatment, the ABCB1 and ABCG2 mRNA expression levels were 1.57- and 1.85-fold lower (p = 0.4 and p = 0.87), respectively, compared to pre-treatment. Bcl2/Bax ratio was numerically but not significantly decreased 1.02-fold (p = 0.74). The overall response rate of this protocol was 50% with a median PFS of 79 days (range 14-207 days). The low medians of relative expression levels of ABCB1, ABCG2 and Bcl2/Bax ratio group did not correlate with the clinical outcomes when compared to the high medians of relative expression levels, and likewise with the clinical stage, immunophenotype, histological grade and sub-stage. Therefore, the administration of a rescue drug with toceranib phosphate might be beneficial in refractory and relapsed canine lymphoma."
"Monitoring minimal residual disease in canine lymphomas treated with modified L-COP or L-CHOP protocols  2018 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.Heteroduplex polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangements (hPARR) was developed to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) in canine B- and T-cell lymphomas treated with the modified L-COP or L-CHOP protocol. Thirty-five dogs were recruited in this study and their neoplastic lineages were determined by immunophenotyping with Pax5 and CD3. Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected prior to and during chemotherapy in weeks 4, 9 and 13 to detect MRD by hPARR. Twenty-eight dogs (80%) had B-cell lymphoma while seven dogs (20%) had T-cell lymphoma. A monoclonal band was detected in 11 cases that showed complete or partial remission before tumour relapse and no response to the current treatment without statistical difference in clinical outcomes; however, the treatment response had an association with the MRD result (P < 0.05). Modified L-CHOP prolonged median progression-free survival as compared to modified L-COP (215 days vs. 93 days; P < 0.05). Substage b had shorter progression-free survival than substage a (90 days vs. 215 days; P < 0.05). Clinical stage III affected median overall survival time when compared to clinical stages IV and V (432, 173 and 118 days, respectively; P < 0.05). hPARR could be used for screening refractory lymphoma together with lymph node measurement in routine clinical cases."
"Fabrication of porous ceramics from non-metallic residue obtained from aluminum recycling plant  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.This study utilized non-metallic residue by-product obtained at aluminum ingot melting plant as the main component in the fabrication of open-cell porous ceramics. The amount which could be utilized varied in the range 34-52 wt%. Alpha-alumina, α-Al2 O3 was the main crystalline phase present in all sintered porous ceramic samples. Mullite, Al6 Si2 O13 was present as a major second phase. The increase in compressive strength in this study mainly came from thicker solid struts in the sample skeleton. Sample containing 46 wt% non-metallic residue, sintered at 1200°C for 4 hours, gave overall excellent mechanical strengths. All the synthesized samples were free from toxic ions and they can be applied for various applications such as ceramic filters and catalysts."
"Determinants of severe acute malnutrition among children under five years in a rural remote setting: A hospital based study from district Tharparkar-Sindh, Pakistan  2018, Professional Medical Publications. All rights reserved.Objectives: To understand and catalogue the specific determinants of this alarming rate of malnutrition among children of Tharparkar district, Sindh Pakistan. Methods: This was a hospital based analytical survey. Data was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire by interviewing mothers of the children (age 6-59 months), admitted in the hospital. Following WHO guidelines, weight and length/ height of 105 children were recorded. Study was conducted in District Headquarters Hospital, Tharparkar district of Sindh province. Results: Almost 48% children admitted in the hospital were identified with severe acute malnutrition. More males (55%) were malnourished as compared to females (45%). Maternal education, household income, family size, breastfeeding, vaccination status, and frequent infections were found to be significantly associated with the severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion: Specific interventions on promoting exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination, and timely health care seeking behaviors would definitely improve the outcomes. Nevertheless, sector wide approaches would be needed on girls’ education, poverty, and food security in the district in order to address the issue of malnutrition."
"Factors affecting photobiological hydrogen production in five filamentous cyanobacteria from Thailand  2018, The Institute of Experimental Botany.We report here the screening of sixteen cyanobacterial and three green algal strains from Thailand for their potential biohydrogen production. Five filamentous cyanobacterial species, namely Calothrix elenkinii, Fischerella muscicola, Nostoc calcicola, Scytonema bohneri, and Tolypothrix distorta, all possessing nitrogenase activity, showed potentially high biohydrogen production. These five strains showed higher hydrogen production in the absence than in the presence of nitrogen. In particular, F. muscicola had a 17-fold increased hydrogen production under combined nitrogen and sulfur deprived conditions. Among various sugars as a carbon source, glucose at 0.1% (w/v) gave the maximal hydrogen production of 10.9 μmol(H2) mg–1(Chl) h–1 in T. distorta grown in BG11 medium without nitrate. Increasing light intensity up to 250 μmol(photon) m–2 s–1 increased hydrogen production in F. muscicola and T. distorta. Overall results indicate that both F. muscicola and T. distorta have a high potential for hydrogen production amenable for further improvement by using molecular genetics technique."
"Smartphone usage capabilities among younger and elderly users  Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.In recent years, the elderly population has increased, and most of them tend to live alone. This means that the elderly need to communicate with their younger colleagues, friends, and family via smartphones because these devices provide several channels of communication, such as calling, chatting, and video conferencing. However, the main problem for the elderly is their physical condition which inhibits them from using smartphones. Thus, the objective of this paper is to find out what are the UI components that degrade their ability for using smartphones. This can be achieved by comparing the capabilities of using smartphones between younger and elderly users and finding out the UI components what cause their capabilities to be different. From our assumption that physical conditions limit the capability of the elderly, we focused our research on their visual capabilities by conducting the experiments on younger users and elderly users, who were requested to perform specific tasks on Line, which is one of the most popular communication applications among Thais. The experimental results reveal that most of the elderly people take longer time to complete their tasks and make more mistakes than younger users. It was found that most of them have problems with color, font style, size, and brightness of UI. As a consequence, it is suggested that a more appropriate UI for smartphone applications, especially communication applications, should be designed to solve such problems in order to increase the elderly's capabilities of using smartphones."
"Routine Prophylactic Antimicrobial Use Is Associated with Increased Phenotypic and Genotypic Resistance in Commensal Escherichia coli Isolates Recovered from Healthy Fattening Pigs on Farms in Thailand  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.This study examined antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles in commensal Escherichia coli derived from healthy fattening pigs in Thai farms that used prophylactic antimicrobials (in-feed tiamulin fumarate and amoxicillin) [PAs], therapeutic antimicrobials (injectable enrofloxacin or gentamicin) [TAs], or no antimicrobials [NAs]. Commensal E. coli were used as a proxy for overall AMR on the farms. There was a high level of multidrug resistance in all three categories of farm, with isolates showing resistance to β-lactams (amoxicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin) and tetracyclines (tetracycline), and commonly possessing tetA, blaTEM, and plasmid replicons FIB and F. On the other hand, isolates with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype (ESBLP) and with resistance to aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, tiamulin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were significantly more common among the PA farms (p < 0.05) than in the other two farm categories. In the PA farms, ESBLP E. coli commonly contained the blaCTX-M-1 group, blaCTX-M-9 group, or both gene groups, and were shown to transfer blaCTX-M genes in a conjugation experiment. E. coli containing N, FIC and A/C replicons were found only in PA farms. In summary, although E. coli isolates from all farms contained a core set of resistance to β-lactams and tetracyclines, the routine use of PA increased resistance rates to other important antimicrobials."
"Cranial index in a modern people of Thai ancestry  2018. Anatomy & Cell Biology.The present research aims to examine the cranial index in a modern people of Thai ancestry. Ultimately, this study will help to create a databank containing a cranial index for the classifications of the people from Asia. In this study, 185 modern crania of people of supposed Thai ancestry were examined. They were collected from the Department of Anatomy at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand. The maximum cranial length and breadth were measured using standard anthropometric instruments based on Martin's methods. The cranial index was calculated using the equation ([maximum cranial breadth/maximum cranial length]×100). The mean cranial indices for the male and female skulls examined were 81.81±4.23 and 82.99±4.37, respectively. The most common type of skull in the modern Thai people in this study was the brachycranic type with a frequency of 42.7%, followed by the mesocranic (27.03%) and hyperbrachycranic types (25.59%). The rarest type observed in this study was the dolichocranic type (4.32%). The present study provides valuable data pertaining to the cranial index in a modern Thai population and reveals that modern Thai males and females belong to the brachycranic group. The results of this study will be of forensic anthropological importance to populations in close proximity to the location where the skulls studied here were sourced."
"Measurement of differential cross sections in the kinematic angular variable ϕ * for inclusive Z boson production in pp collisions at √s=8 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Measurements of differential cross sections dσ/dϕ* and double-differential cross sections d2σ/dϕ*d|y| for inclusive Z boson production are presented using the dielectron and dimuon final states. The kinematic observable ϕ* correlates with the dilepton transverse momentum but has better resolution, and y is the dilepton rapidity. The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1. The normalised cross section (1/σ) dσ/dϕ*, within the fiducial kinematic region, is measured with a precision of better than 0.5% for ϕ* < 1. The measurements are compared to theoretical predictions and they agree, typically, within few percent.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Combined search for electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A statistical combination of several searches for the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos is presented. All searches use proton-proton collision data at s=13 TeV, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. In addition to the combination of previous searches, a targeted analysis requiring three or more charged leptons (electrons or muons) is presented, focusing on the challenging scenario in which the difference in mass between the two least massive neutralinos is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson. The results are interpreted in simplified models of chargino-neutralino or neutralino pair production. For chargino-neutralino production, in the case when the lightest neutralino is massless, the combination yields an observed (expected) limit at the 95% confidence level on the chargino mass of up to 650 (570) GeV, improving upon the individual analysis limits by up to 40 GeV. If the mass difference between the two least massive neutralinos is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson in the chargino-neutralino model, the targeted search requiring three or more leptons obtains observed and expected exclusion limits of around 225 GeV on the second neutralino mass and 125 GeV on the lightest neutralino mass, improving the observed limit by about 60 GeV in both masses compared to the previous CMS result. In the neutralino pair production model, the combined observed (expected) exclusion limit on the neutralino mass extends up to 650–750 (550–750) GeV, depending on the branching fraction assumed. This extends the observed exclusion achieved in the individual analyses by up to 200 GeV. The combined result additionally excludes some intermediate gaps in the mass coverage of the individual analyses.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Importance of culture history on 17α-ethinylestradiol cometabolism by nitrifying sludge  2018 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen which interfere the endocrine and reproductive function in living organisms, has been found extensively to be deposited into municipal wastewater treatment plants and the environment via human excretion. EE2 has long been known to be efficiently cometabolized by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during ammonia (NH3) oxidation. Current study aims to investigate the effect of culture history on the biotransformation of EE2 by nitrifying sludge which was enriched under different ammonia loading rates in continuous flow reactors. Result showed that past growth condition largely affected not only the metabolic rate of NH3 oxidation but also EE2 cometabolism. Sludge previously acclimated with higher NH3 loads as well as sludge dominated with AOB belong to high growth cluster (Nitrosomonas europaea-Nitrosococcus mobilis) showed higher rate of EE2 biotransformation than those one being acclimated with lower NH3 loads because of its ability to provide more reducing power from NH3 oxidation. Moreover, the correlation between the degradation rates of NH3 and EE2 was higher in sludge being acclimated with higher load of NH3 in comparison with other sludge. Implication of the findings emphasized the role of volumetric NH3 loading rate in determining EE2 removal in wastewater treatment system."
"Lipolytic and antimicrobial activities of pseudomonas strains isolated from soils in Phetchaburi Province, Thailand  Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria. and 2018 The authors.Purpose: To identify and determine lipolytic and antimicrobial activities, and antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from soils in Phetchaburi Province, Thailand. Methods: Bacterial strains were isolated from surface soils by enrichment technique using lipolytic broth (LB) and then identified based on their phenotypic and genetic characteristics. The cell-free culture supernatant was determined for lipase activity by spectrophotometric assay. Disc diffusion assay was used to determine the crude ethyl acetate extract of the culture supernatant for antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility. The chemical profile of the crude ethyl acetate extract was analyzed by reverse-phase C-18 column high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: On the basis of phenotypic properties and their 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, five bacterial isolates, P1-2, P1-5, P1-6, P1-10 and P1-20 were identified as strains of Pseudomonas with sequence similarities (99.7 – 100 %). The extracellular lipase activity in LB supplemented with 1 % (v/v) of each of Tween 20, Tween 40, 60 or 80 as the substrate ranged from 11.61 ± 0.61 to 15.09 ± 0.42, 11.79 ± 0.28 to 15.75 ± 0.47, 12.65 ± 0.01 to 14.59 ± 0.87 and 12.71 ± 0.25 to 13.96 ± 0.21 unit/mL, respectively. The crude ethyl acetate extract of isolates P1-5, P1-6 and P1-20 contained quinoline alkaloid compounds and exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Kocuria rhizophila ATCC 9341 and Staphylococcus aureus strains ATCC 25923, ATCC 6358 and ATCC 25913, but not against Gram-negative Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. All the isolates were susceptible to cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, amikacin, gentamicin, imipeneum, meropeneum and levofloxacin. Conclusion: The isolates demonstrate high lipolytic activity while the crude extracts exhibit antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, this lipase is a potential enzyme for pharmaceutical applications."
"The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide in migraine prevention by botulinum toxin type A  2018, ASEAN Neurological Association. All rights reserved.Objectives: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is currently considered to be a major contributing factor in migraine headache. Botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) was found to be effective in migraine prevention. However, the mechanism of action in patients was unknown. Using injection as in clinical setting, the study aimed to determine whether BTXA could decrease the sensitization of the trigeminovascular nociceptive system through the reduction of CGRP action. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were pretreated with normal saline solution or BTXA before KCl application to induce cortical spreading depression (CSD) or NaCl application as a control. Regional cerebral blood flow at parietal cortex was measured for 90 min after KCl or NaCl application. Tissues from trigeminal ganglion (TG) and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) were then collected for CGRP and c-Fos measurement respectively. Results: BTXA pretreatment significantly decreased the cumulative blood flow and number of hyperemic peaks induced by KCl. Numbers of CGRP positive cells at TG and c-Fos positive cells at TNC were also reduced by BTXA. Conclusion: BTXA pretreatment reduced CGRP production and release from the TG leading to lessen CSD production and persistent activation of TNC which played a major role in migraine headache."
"Prevalence of bacteremia in dogs admitted to an intensive care unit with intravenous catheterization  The Thai Journal of Veterinary Medicine, 2018.Bacteremia is a common complication in hospitalized patients, and intravenous catheterization is a routine intervention in dogs in intensive care units (ICU). This study aimed to investigate bacteria associated with bacteremia in an ICU of a veterinary teaching hospital during 2013-2014. Fifty dogs admitted to the ICU were included in this study. Twenty-four dogs (48.00%) presented bacteremia by blood culture. Bacterial species were identified, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (8/24), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7/24), Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (3/24), Escherichia coli (2/24), Bacillus sp. (1/24), Acinetobacter sp. (2/24) and Burkholderia cepacia (1/24). Only five dogs had positive catheter colonization by identical bacterial species with those isolated from blood. Risk factors and clinical presentation were not associated with bacteremia in the dogs and need further evaluation. The study showed that commensal flora and environmental saprophytes were sources of bacteremia in canine patients admitted to the ICU."
"Effect of interferential current therapy on ground reaction force in dogs with hip osteoarthritis: A randomized placebo controlled cross-over clinical trial  The Thai Journal of Veterinary Medicine, 2018.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of interferential current therapy on ground reaction force and orthopedic assessment score of canine patients with hip osteoarthritis. Nine dogs that met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Each dog received 3 types of treatment: interferential current therapy (IFC), sham current therapy (SHAM), and control treatment (CTR). The order of the treatments for each dog was assigned by block randomization method. A 24-hour interval was applied between each treatment session. Subjective orthopedic assessment and objective force plate gait analysis were used as measurement of clinical improvement in this study. Lameness, articular mobility and articular pain scores as well as peak vertical force (PVF) variables were assessed prior to and post treatments. Statistical analyses revealed significant increase in PVF of the IFC group (p < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in PVF in the CTR group (p < 0.05). In the SHAM group, there was no significant change in PVF. There were no significant changes detected in the lameness, articular mobility and articular pain scores. Post hoc comparisons using Tukey-Kramer test demonstrated that the IFC treatment was significantly more effective than the SHAM and CTR treatments (p < 0.05). The significant improvement in PVF of the dogs with hip osteoarthritis may be associated with pain alleviation effect of the IFC treatment. The results of this study suggest that IFC may be useful for the treatment of canine osteoarthritis."
"Properties and performance of microemulsion fuel: blending of jatropha oil, diesel, and ethanol- surfactant  2017 Elsevier LtdTo assure energy security source, a renewable nonedible plant such as Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) is attractive as a feedstock. However, the high viscosity of this vegetable oil is the main limitation on its fuel properties and makes it unsuitable for direct application in current diesel engines. Microemulsification is an alternative method for fuel production that reduces the by-products from the transesterification process. In this research, microemulsion fuels (MFs) were produced from crude JCO, diesel and ethanol in the presence of a surfactant. Three formulations of MFs with various composition of diesel and an ethanol-surfactant ratio were examined in terms of their biodiesel characteristics, performance and emission levels. For instance MF(E5), MF(E5)-LS1 and MF(E10)-LS1 were MFs without surfactant, ME with 5% and 10% of the ethanol-surfactant component, respectively. The high heating value, kinematic viscosity and water content of the MFs were close to the biodiesel standard and compatible for use with diesel engines. In addition, the MF(E5), gave an engine power, brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature similar to those of petroleum-derived diesel. The emissions from these MFs showed a lower smoke emission than that of diesel, while the CO and CO2 emissions were similar to those of diesel. Thus MF(E5) showed great potential for use as biofuel with less exhaust smoke emission in diesel engines without modification."
"Immunohistochemical localization of inhibin/activin subunits in adult asian elephant (Elephas maximus) testes  2018 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.Immunolocalization of inhibin-α and inhibin/activin βA and βB subunits in the testes of Asian elephant was determined. Testicular sections were immunostained with polyclonal antisera against inhibin subunit-α and inhibin/activin βA and βB using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Positive immunostaining against inhibin-α subunit was strongly present in Sertoli cells, and positive immunostaining for the inhibin/activin βA and βB subunits was observed in both Sertoli and Leydig cells. These results indicated that while Sertoli cells are the predominant source of inhibin and activin secretions in the testes of adult male Asian elephant, Leydig cells are a source of activin but not inhibin."
"Detection of PRRSV circulation using oral fluid samples for  The Thai Journal of Veterinary Medicine, 2018.Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has become a major swine disease worldwide. Relevant management strategies and diagnostic assays are of importance for PRRS virus (PRRSV) control. The objective of this study was to determine the use of oral fluids for PRRSV monitoring in endemically PRRSV-infected herds. PRRSV RNA and PRRSV-specific antibodies were monitored using oral fluid samples and serum samples in two conventional swine farms in Thailand ('Farm A', a one-site conventional system farm, and 'Farm B', a one-site P0-P1 segregation system farm) during farrowing to nursery periods. Both PRRSV RNA and PRRSV antibodies were detected from 3 to 9 weeks of age in both sample types. Pen-based oral fluid samples were detected positive over 71% when the prevalence of serum PRRSV-positive pigs in the pens was at least 40%. Mean S/P ratios of the oral fluid samples showed significantly higher levels but had similar pattern to the seroprofile of the blood samples. Increased levels of PRRSV antibodies were detected in all groups at 5 to 9 weeks of age. Overall, the positive correlation of both sample types was 0.65 (p < 0.001). It should be noted that Farm B had higher production losses in the farrowing and nursery units, concurrently, with higher levels of PRRSV load in both sample types. Oral fluid testing provides convenient and economical approach, better welfare, and satisfied performance to determine PRRS status, especially during nursery period, when there is moderate to high PRRSV prevalence. These objectives could be better achieved and benefit practitioners by using oral fluid testing together with other measurements."
"Evaluation of two cryopreservation protocols on cauda epididymal spermatozoa characteristics in domestic cats  The Thai Journal of Veterinary Medicine, 2018.Various protocols of feline spermatozoa cryopreservation have been reported and used in clinical practice. To compare the quality of post-thawed epididymal spermatozoa subjected to two different sperm freezing protocols, sperm samples were collected from domestic cats (n=7) after castration and divided into 2 aliquots as for Protocol 1 (P1) or Protocol 2 (P2). In P1, after centrifugation, sperm pellets were extended with Tris-based egg yolk extender (TEY) containing 3% glycerol and held for 60 min (5°C) prior to the second dilution (1:1) with 7% glycerol and 1% Equex STM Paste. The straws were frozen by lowering the goblets in three steps into a LN2 tank. In P2, sperm pellets were re-suspended in TEY free of glycerol, left for 15 min at room temperature before the addition (1:1) of TEY containing 8% glycerol and 1% Equex. After loading into 0.25-ml straws at room temperature, the sperm were cooled to 5°C for 25 min and subsequently frozen in a Styrofoam box at 4 cm above LN2 for 10 min. Thawing was done at 37°C for 1 min. No significant differences (P > 0.05) between the two protocols (P1 vs P2) in all parameters were observed; total motility (30±8.1 vs 30±3.4; mean±SEM), progressive motility score (3±0.2 vs 3±0.2), percentage of spermatozoa with intact plasma membrane (38.5±4.5 vs 44.5±6.9) and intact acrosome (34±3.2 vs 38±4.7), respectively. In conclusion, both protocols used in the present study yielded similar post-thawed sperm characteristics."
"Mutations in QRDRs of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV genes in nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella enterica isolated from chicken meat, pork and humans  The Thai Journal of Veterinary Medicine, 2018.Twenty-eight nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella isolates originated from chicken meat, pork and humans were examined for mutation in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes. Four single-point mutations in gyrA (i.e. C248A, C248T, G259T and G259A) leading to amino acid substitutions Ser83Tyr, Ser83Phe, Asp87Tyr and Asp87Asn in GyrA, respectively, were identified in 11 quinolone-resistant strains. Amino acid change at position Ser83 was most frequently identified. Resistance to nalidixic acid was not always associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin. The presence of mutations in GyrA did not well correlate with ciprofloxacin resistance phenotype. No mutations were observed in gyrB and parE. A serovar Typhimurium resistant to nalidixic acid did not carry any mutations in QRDR of all genes tested. The results highlight the high frequency of mutation in gyrA in the quinolone-resistant isolates and the existence of alternative-quinolone resistance mechanisms."
"Hydrogeological parameter distribution estimation by geostatistical methods in regional groundwater modeling in the upper central plain, Thailand  2018 IAEME Publication. All rights reserved.Groundwater is playing an important role in water extraction and utilizations especially in Upper Central Plain, Thailand. The farmers traditionally relied on rain and flood water for crops but the amount needed for rice cultivation was not proper in dry years and used groundwater as a supplement especially in the dry year. In this study, regional groundwater model is developed with small grid size (2km x 2km) and improved by adding more well data, estimating transmissivity from well data and applying the geostatistical method to estimate the hydraulic conductivity distribution. The groundwater model in the Upper Central Plain was calibrated (1993-1999) and verified (2000-2005) using peizometric heads observed. The proposed parameter estimation and its distribution were proved to workable under limited available well pump test data and can improve the peizometric head simulation when applied to the regional groundwater model in the study area."
"LINE-1 ORF1 Protein Is Up-regulated by reactive Oxygen species and associated with bladder urothelial carcinoma progression  2018 International Institute of Anticancer Research. All Rights Reserved.Background/Aim: Reactivation of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and oxidative stress are suggested to have oncogenic potential to drive tumorigenesis and cancer progression. We previously demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused hypomethylation of LINE-1 elements in bladder cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the expression of LINE-1-encoded protein (ORF1p) and oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in human bladder cancer tissues, as well as induction of ORF1p expression by ROS in bladder cancer cell lines. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six cancerous and 15 non-cancerous adjacent tissues were immunohistochemically stained for ORF1p and 4-HNE. ORF1p expression and cell migration were determined in bladder cancer cells exposed to H2O2. Results: ORF1p and 4-HNE expression was higher in cancerous than non-cancerous tissues. Elevated ORF1p expression was associated with increased 4-HNE expression and with advanced tumors. H2O2 provoked oxidative stress and up-regulated ORF1p expression in VM-CUB-1 compared to the untreated control, and to a lesser degree in TCCSUP. H2O2 exposure enhanced cell migration in UM-UC-3, TCCSUP and VM-CUB-1. Conclusion: Elevated ORF1p expression is associated with tumor progression. ROS experimentally induce ORF1p expression and promote migration in bladder cancer cells."
"Does space-time torsion determine the minimum mass of gravitating particles?  2018, The Author(s).We derive upper and lower limits for the mass–radius ratio of spin-fluid spheres in Einstein–Cartan theory, with matter satisfying a linear barotropic equation of state, and in the presence of a cosmological constant. Adopting a spherically symmetric interior geometry, we obtain the generalized continuity and Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations for a Weyssenhoff spin fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium, expressed in terms of the effective mass, density and pressure, all of which contain additional contributions from the spin. The generalized Buchdahl inequality, which remains valid at any point in the interior, is obtained, and general theoretical limits for the maximum and minimum mass–radius ratios are derived. As an application of our results we obtain gravitational red shift bounds for compact spin-fluid objects, which may (in principle) be used for observational tests of Einstein–Cartan theory in an astrophysical context. We also briefly consider applications of the torsion-induced minimum mass to the spin-generalized strong gravity model for baryons/mesons, and show that the existence of quantum spin imposes a lower bound for spinning particles, which almost exactly reproduces the electron mass."
"Study of dijet events with a large rapidity gap between the two leading jets in pp collisions at √s=7TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.Events with no charged particles produced between the two leading jets are studied in proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV. The jets were required to have transverse momentum pTjet>40GeV and pseudorapidity 1.5 < | ηjet| < 4.7 , and to have values of ηjet with opposite signs. The data used for this study were collected with the CMS detector during low-luminosity running at the LHC, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 8pb-1. Events with no charged particles with pT> 0.2 GeV in the interval - 1 < η< 1 between the jets are observed in excess of calculations that assume no color-singlet exchange. The fraction of events with such a rapidity gap, amounting to 0.5–1% of the selected dijet sample, is measured as a function of the pT of the second-leading jet and of the rapidity separation between the jets. The data are compared to previous measurements at the Tevatron, and to perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations based on the Balitsky–Fadin–Kuraev–Lipatov evolution equations, including different models of the non-perturbative gap survival probability."
"Measurement of the inclusive t t ¯ cross section in pp collisions at √s=5.02 TeV using final states with at least one charged lepton  2018, The Author(s).The top quark pair production cross section (σtt ¯) is measured for the first time in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The data were collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 27.4 pb−1. The measurement is performed by analyzing events with at least one charged lepton. The measured cross section is σtt ¯ = 69.5 ± 6.1 (stat) ± 5.6 (syst) ± 1.6 (lumi) pb, with a total relative uncertainty of 12%. The result is in agreement with the expectation from the standard model. The impact of the presented measurement on the determination of the gluon distribution function is investigated."
"Theoretical and experimental studies on inclusion complexes of pinostrobin and β-cyclodextrins  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Pinostrobin (PNS) belongs to the flavanone subclass of flavonoids which shows several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerogenic, anti-viral and anti-oxidative effects. Similar to other flavonoids, PNS has a quite low water solubility. The purpose of this work is to improve the solubility and the biological activities of PNS by forming inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrin(βCD)and its derivatives, heptakis-(2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin(2,6-DMβCD)and (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD). The AL-typediagram of the phase solubility studies of PNS exhibited the formed inclusion complexes with the 1:1 molar ratio. Inclusion complexes were prepared by the freeze-drying method and were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation revealed two different binding modes of PNS, i.e., its phenyl- (P-PNS) and chromone- (C-PNS) rings preferably inserted into the cavity of βCD derivatives whilst only one orientation of PNS, where the C-PNS ring is inside the cavity, was detected in the case of the parental βCD. All PNS/βCDs complexes had a higher dissolution rate than free PNS. Both PNS and its complexes significantly exerted a lowering effect on the IL-6 secretion in LPS-stimulated macrophages and showed a moderate cytotoxic effect against MCF-7 and HeLa cancer cell lines in vitro."
"Occurrence of bovine tuberculosis among cattle herds from nomadic peri-urban settlements and cattle slaughtered at the municipal abattoir of Bauchi, North-Eastern Nigeria  Network for the Veterinarians of Bangladesh, 2018.Objective: This study was designed to determine the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) at the municipal abattoir and cattle herds in peri-urban nomadic settlements of Bauchi state of Northeastern Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A total of 2440 cattle slaughtered at the municipal abattoir from June to September were examined for lesions characteristic of bTB and eighty-six (n=86) cows selected from two cattle herds located at temporary nomadic settlements in Bauchi metropolis were also screened for bTB using purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test. During the study period, total of 2,440 cattle were slaughtered comprising majority of females (n=1656) and males (n=784) as well as of different breeds including majority of White Fulani (n=1864) followed by Red Bororo (n=508) and Sokoto Gudali (n=68). Results: The results revealed that out of the 2,440 slaughtered cattle inspected for tuberculous-like lesions, 51 had lesions suspected to be lesions characteristic of tuberculosis, while 48 were positive for Ziehl-Neelsen. Prevalence rate of 1.96% based on microscopic examination and 2.0% based on suspected gross lesion were recorded. The prevalence was 0.77% for males, 1.2% females, 1.84% for adults, 0.12% for calves and 1.8% for white Fulani (Bunaji), 0.12% for Red Bororo (Rahaji) and 0.04% for Sokoto Gudali (Bokoloji). In addition, screening of 86 cows showed that 8.1% were positive for tuberculosis using tuberculin test. Conclusion: The outcome of this study showed that bTB is still endemic in Bauchi state and this can pose a significant public health challenge. Thus, it is recommended that the government should intensify the test-and-slaughter policy as well as put in place an effective monitoring and surveillance control programs for bTB to mitigate the risks posed to public health by this zoonotic disease in the study area."
"Emergence of colistin resistance in extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated from food animals and its public health implication: A review  Network for the Veterinarians of Bangladesh, 2018.Antimicrobial resistance as a result of emergence of extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae is a major health problem of human and animal that requires an intensive global attention. The production of beta lactamase enzymes remains as one of the major factors contributing to the development of resistance to beta lactams. These enzymes hydrolyze the beta lactam ring of the antibiotic and render it ineffective. Extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing bacteria have the ability to develop resistance to a number of antibiotics including the carbapenem and other third generation cephalosporins. In addition, the recent emergence and dissemination of the colistin resistance determinants mcr-1, mcr-2 and mcr-3 poses a serious threat to colistin as a drug of last resort in human medicine. In this review, we utilized words such as ""colistin resistance and Escherichia coli"", ""Klebsiella and colistin resistance"", ""colistin resistance and Salmonella"" as well as ""detection of mcr-1 genes in Salmonella and E. coli"". The extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing bacteria under Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to colistin possess the ability to be transferred resistant determinants to other susceptible cells at a higher frequency. In this paper, the role of manure from food animals and how air travel contributes to the dissemination of mcr-1 haboring bacteria, resistance determinants and other metabolites that constitute a public health problem was also reviewed. It is concluded that these pathogens have significant consequences to the control of infection and plays key roles in treatment failure with colistin."
"Search for ZZ resonances in the 2ℓ2ν final state in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for heavy resonances decaying to a pair of Z bosons is performed using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Events are selected by requiring two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons), consistent with the decay of a Z boson, and large missing transverse momentum, which is interpreted as arising from the decay of a second Z boson to two neutrinos. The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The hypothesis of a spin-2 bulk graviton (X) decaying to a pair of Z bosons is examined for 600 ≤ mX ≤ 2500 GeV and upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction of X → ZZ ranging from 100 to 4 fb. For bulk graviton models characterized by a curvature scale parameter k˜ = 0.5 in the extra dimension, the region mXOpenSPiltSPi 800 GeV is excluded, providing the most stringent limit reported to date. Variations of the model considering the possibility of a wide resonance produced exclusively via gluon-gluon fusion or q q ¯ annihilation are also examined.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Current Literature Review of Registered Nurses’ Competency in the Global Community  2018 Sigma Theta Tau InternationalPurpose: In order to enhance international standards of nursing service, this article aims to analyze the English full-text peer-reviewed published articles from the past 10 years that describe contemporary registered nurses’ (RNs’) competency in the global community. Design: An integrative review of literature was conducted between June 2016 and January 2017. Methods: A systematic search was completed using four databases (Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) that covered the years between 2007 and 2017, and used the key words nurs* OR (staff nurs*) OR (register nurs*) AND competenc* AND international OR global. Ultimately, 32 studies meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected for analysis. Findings: Nursing competency trended towards definitions using a holistic lens and behavior statements reflecting the skills, knowledge, attitudes, and judgment required for effective performance in the nursing profession. By using inductive content analysis, 11 components emerged. Additionally, six instruments were found to measure generalist RNs’ competencies across countries. The variables related to generalist nursing competency included sociodemographic variables, professional-related variables, and work environment variables. Conclusions: This review provides the research evidence for updating definitions, components, measurements, and variables related to RNs’ competency in the global community. Further research should consider cross-cultural validation of instruments and influencing factors related to nursing competency. Clinical Relevance: The components and measurements identified in this review can be used by nursing administrators to select or evaluate qualified nurses. The multivariables related to nursing competency can assistant hospital administrators to recognize and find effective ways to improve nursing competency."
"Fabrication of high-density microneedle masters towards the commercialisation of dissolving microneedles  The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.Recent progress of dissolving microneedles opens up a great potential for the utilisation of microneedles in a wide range of applications. However, the commercialisation of dissolving microneedles requires mass production of microneedle masters and moulds. In this work, a simple, low-cost and high-throughput fabrication method of high-density microneedle masters is presented. The high-density microneedle masters were fabricated by first machining an aluminium workpiece to form high-density rectangular column arrays using wire-cut electrode discharge machining. Subsequently, the rectangular column arrays were subjected to a chemical etching under a mass-transport limited condition resulting in the formation of conical-shaped microneedle masters without the need of etch mask. For demonstration, the fabricated microneedle masters were used as a template for the fabrication of an inverse polymer mould and subsequently the polymer mould was used for the fabrication of silk microneedles. The proposed method offers a simple, low cost and high throughput means for the mass production of high-density microneedle masters towards the commercialisation of dissolving microneedles."
"Management of patients on antithrombotic agents undergoing emergency and elective endoscopy: Joint Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) and Asian Pacific Society for Digestive Endoscopy (APSDE) practice guidelines  2018 Author(s).This Guideline is a joint official statement of the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) and the Asian Pacific Society for Digestive Endoscopy (APSDE). It was developed in response to the increasing use of antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) in patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy in Asia. After reviewing current practice guidelines in Europe and the USA, the joint committee identified unmet needs, noticed inconsistencies, raised doubts about certain recommendations and recognised significant discrepancies in clinical practice between different regions. We developed this joint official statement based on a systematic review of the literature, critical appraisal of existing guidelines and expert consensus using a two-stage modified Delphi process. This joint APAGE-APSDE Practice Guideline is intended to be an educational tool that assists clinicians in improving care for patients on antithrombotics who require emergency or elective GI endoscopy in the Asian Pacific region."
"Natural infection of questing ixodid ticks with protozoa and bacteria in Chonburi Province, Thailand  2018 Elsevier GmbHIxodid ticks are important vectors of tick-borne disease agents affecting humans and animals, with wildlife often serving as important reservoirs. This study examined protozoal and bacterial infection in questing ticks in forest habitats in Chonburi Province, Thailand in 2015, using PCR and DNA sequencing techniques. A total of 12,184 ticks were morphologically identified to species and a subset of ticks were confirmed by PCR, targeting the tick mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. Tick species collected included Haemaphysalis lagrangei (92.8%), H. wellingtoni (0.1%), and Rhipicephalus microplus (7.0%). In total, 419 tick pools [ELM(1] [ST2] were examined by PCR amplification of a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia and Theileria species, and the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria in the family Anaplasmataceae. Results revealed a tick infection rate for the tick pools of 57.0% (239/419) including four pathogens and one bacterial symbiont. The highest infection rate in H. lagrangei, H. wellingtoni, and R. microplus pools was recorded for Anaplasma spp. at 55.6% (233/419) including three Anaplasma species genotype groups Anaplasma spp. closely related to A. bovis, A. platys, and unidentified Anaplasma spp. Theileria spp. showed a lower infection rate in H. lagrangei at 4.3% (18/419) with three Theileria species genotypes closely related to T. cervi, T. capreoli, and unidentified Theileria spp. Only 0.2% (1/419) of H. lagrangei pools contained Babesia spp., Ehrlichia spp., or Wolbachia spp. [ELM(3] [ST4] These findings provided information on tick species in wildlife habitats and detected protozoa and bacteria in the ticks. The results suggest that these tick species are possible vectors for transmitting tick-borne disease agents in Thailand wildlife habitats."
"CHIP regulates aquaporin-2 quality control and body water homeostasis Copyright  2018 by the American Society of Nephrology. The importance of the kidney distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) is highlighted by various water and electrolyte disorders that arise when the unique transport properties of these segments are disturbed. Despite this critical role, little is known about which proteins have a regulatory role in these cells and how these cells can be regulated by individual physiologic stimuli. By combining proteomics, bioinformatics, and cell biology approaches,we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP is highly expressed throughout the collecting duct; is modulated in abundance by vasopressin; interacts with aquaporin-2 (AQP2), Hsp70, and Hsc70; and can directly ubiquitylate the water channel AQP2 in vitro. shRNA knockdown of CHIP in CCD cells increased AQP2 protein t 1/2 and reduced AQP2 ubiquitylation, resulting in greater levels of AQP2 andphosphorylatedAQP2.CHIP knockdown increased the plasma membrane abundance of AQP2 in these cells. Compared with wild-type controls, CHIP knockout mice or novel CRISPR/Cas9 mice without CHIPE3 ligase activity had greater AQP2 abundance and altered renal water handling, with decreased water intake and urine volume, alongside higher urine osmolality. We did not observe significant changes in other water- or sodium-transporting proteins in the gene-modified mice. In summary, these results suggest that CHIP regulates AQP2 and subsequently, renal water handling."
"Methotrexate, but not narrowband ultraviolet B radiation, suppresses interleukin-33 mRNA levels in psoriatic plaques and protein levels in serum of patients with psoriasis  2017 Japanese Dermatological AssociationInterleukin (IL)-33 can function both as a conventional cytokine and as a nuclear factor regulating gene transcription. IL-33 expression is strongly upregulated in the nucleus of keratinocytes and serum of patients with psoriasis. However, the role of IL-33 in psoriasis is unclear, and IL-33 expression in the lesional psoriatic skin after conventional systemic treatments has not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to compare IL-33 mRNA in patients’ lesional skin samples and IL-33 protein expression in patients’ serum before and after treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB). IL-33 mRNA levels in lesional skin and IL-33 protein levels in serum were downregulated after treatment with MTX. Results revealed a significant decrease in IL-33 protein expression (P = 0.028). IL-33 expression increased after NB-UVB treatment. IL-33 production is associated with inflammatory skin in psoriasis, possibly through its cytokine function. However, high expression of IL-33 after NB-UVB treatment suggests the occurrence of unknown functions to alleviate psoriatic lesions without IL-33 involvement."
"Naphthalene Derivatives and Quinones from Ventilago denticulata and Their Nitric Oxide Radical Scavenging, Antioxidant, Cytotoxic, Antibacterial, and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitory Activities  2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, SwitzerlandNew naphthalene derivatives (1 and 2) and a new isomer (3) of ventilagolin, together with known anthraquinones, chrysophanol (4), physcion or emodin 3-methyl ether (5), and emodin (6), were isolated from vines of Ventilago denticulata.

"Litter removal in a tropical rain forest reduces fine root biomass and production but litter addition has few effects  2018 by the Ecological Society of AmericaMany old-growth lowland tropical rain forests are potentially nutrient limited, and it has long been thought that many such forests maintain growth by recycling nutrients from decomposing litter. We investigated this by continuously removing (for 10 yr) freshly fallen litter from five (45 m × 45 m) plots, adding it to five other plots, there were five controls. From monthly measures over 1 yr we show that litter removal caused lower: fine root (≤2 mm diameter) standing mass, fine root standing length, fine root length production and fine root length survivorship. Litter addition did not significantly change fine root mass or length or production. Nutrient concentrations in fine roots in litter removal plots were lower than those in controls for nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), concentrations in fine roots in litter addition plots were higher for N and Ca. Chronic litter removal has resulted in reduced forest growth due to lack of nutrients, probably nitrogen. Conversely, long-term litter addition has had fewer effects."
"Semi-rigid composite foams of calcium sodium aluminosilicate from eggshells embedded in polyurethane  Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich.Calcium sodium aluminosilicate (CaNaAlSi2 O7) ceramic powder was prepared from eggshells as a raw material via the sol-gel process at room temperature. The CaNaAlSi2O7 ceramic particles were embedded as a dispersed phase in the polyurethane (PU) foam matrix via a direct foaming process. The calcium sodium aluminosilicate (CaNaAlSi2O7) ceramic powder had a high specific surface area of 38.89 m2 g–1 , and a fine average particle size of 13.27 lm, whereas the PU foam had a low specific surface area of 1.00 m2 g–1, and of light weight. After adding 10 vol% CaNaAlSi2O7 to the PU, the composite foams possessed a high specific surface area of 6.0 m2 g–1, a bulk density of 0.213 ± 0.012 g cm–3 , a high decomposition temperature of 790 8C, and a high compressive Young’s modulus of 346.0 ± 76.5 kPa. The CaNaAlSi2 O7/PU composite foams provided good thermal conductivity, uniform pore size and particle size distribution, good bridge bonding, and with microcellular interconnecting cells. The CaNaAlSi2O7 / PU semi-rigid composite foams are potential candidate materials for a variety of products such as construction materials, catalysts, insulation materials, and adsorbent materials. There are several advantages of the semi-rigid composite foams: light weight, high specific surface area, and high thermal decomposition temperature."
"Surface-Dependence of Adsorption and Its Influence on Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Reaction: A Case of Photocatalytic Degradation of Linuron on Zinc Oxide  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: This work systematically investigates a discrepancy in photocatalytic degradation pathway observed even when same kind of photocatalyst is used. This issue is particularly important for the degradation of toxic compound because the shifting in the pathway may result in intermediates having increased toxicity. Linuron, which is a toxic herbicide, is used as a model compound and zinc oxide (ZnO) is used as a catalyst. Two forms of ZnO having different exposing surfaces, i.e., conventional particles and nanorods are considered. It is experimentally shown and confirmed by molecular simulation that the adsorption and subsequent degradation are surface dependent. The adsorption capacity of linuron on polar surfaces of ZnO is much higher than that on non-polar surface. More importantly, alignments of linuron molecule adsorbing on different surfaces are different, leading to formation of different degradation intermediates. The degradation takes place on both aliphatic and aromatic sides when linuron adsorbs on polar surfaces whereas only the aliphatic part is attacked by hydroxyl radicals on the non-polar mixed terminated surface. The results in this work indicate that the exposing surface of the photocatalyst is the key factor in determining the degradation pathway and it should be considered in the catalyst design.

"CdtC-induced processing of membrane-bound CdtA is a crucial step in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin holotoxin formation  2018 American Society for Microbiology.Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is an oral pathogen causing periodontal disease and bacterial endocarditis. It produces cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that could damage mammalian cells and tissues. CDT is a tripartite protein toxin composed of CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC. We have previously indicated that CdtA is a lipoprotein and that the proteolytic processing of CdtA is important for biogenesis and secretion of CDT holotoxin. Here, we established an in vitro processing assay of CdtA and investigated the interactions of CdtA with other Cdt subunits. This assay demonstrated that incubation of membrane-bound CdtA (MCdtA), CdtB, and CdtC immediately generated a processed form of CdtA (CdtA'), which is recovered from the soluble fraction. In contrast, incubation of soluble membraneunbound CdtA with CdtB and CdtC did not yield any CdtA'. Furthermore, incubation of CdtC with MCdtA was enough to induce rapid processing of MCdtA, whereas CdtB alone was unable to induce the processing. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that CdtA' and CdtC formed a complex. Furthermore, subsequent addition of CdtB to this reaction mixture resulted in complete CDT holotoxin complex. The cytolethal distending activity assay demonstrated that CDT complex containing CdtA' showed far stronger cytotoxicity than that containing CdtA. Collectively, our data suggest that CDT holotoxin formation in vivo is a sequential event: interaction of MCdtA and CdtC induces proteolytic processing of MCdtA, and the released CdtA' forms a complex with CdtC. Subsequent binding of CdtB to the CdtA'/CdtC complex results in CDT holotoxin formation."
"Characteristics of hydrochar and hydrothermal liquid products from hydrothermal carbonization of corncob  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.Corncob (CC) was converted to renewable fuel resource by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). HTC was performed by varying process temperature (160–200 °C), residence time (1–3 h), and biomass to water ratio (BTW) (1:5 to 1:15). The properties of hydrochar were significantly enhanced where the fixed carbon and carbon content of hydrochar increased at about 24.9 and 83.7% from original contents in CC, respectively. The calorific values and yield of hydrochar were between 19.3–23.5 MJ/kg and 50.1–58.6%. The optimal condition for the production of hydrochar as solid fuel was determined at 200 °C, 3 h residence time, and BTW of 1:5 with maximum energy yield of 68.74%. In addition, hydrothermal liquid was characterized where volatile fatty acid, furfural, furfuryl alcohol, and hydroxymethylfurfural were the most abundant compositions with their highest yields of 17.3, 11.5, 7.9, and 5.1%, respectively. Process temperature was the most influencing variable on product properties and characteristics. The results suggested that corncob has high potential as a source for solid fuel and valuable platform chemicals."
"Formulation, physical, in vitro and ex vivo evaluation of nanomedicine-based chemosterilant for non-surgical castration of male animals  2017 Elsevier Inc.The overpopulation of free-roaming companion animals has become the global crisis. The development and application of a suitable, effective, non-surgical approach for animal sterilization would have an enormous advantage over the current surgical method. The main purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel nanomedicine-based chemosterilant for non-surgical castration of male companion animals. In this study, we first sought to investigate the testicular toxicity of different apoptosis-inducing agents. We next synthesized and characterized nano-sized particles which encapsulated the most potent testicular toxicants and evaluated in vitro sterilant properties. Our result showed that doxorubicin exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity against mouse spermatogenic cells. We therefore synthesized and characterized doxorubicin-encapsulated nanoemulsion. The negatively charged particle of doxorubicin-encapsulated nanoemulsion exhibited the anti-proliferative activity towards spermatogetic cells. Apoptosis studies revealed activation of Caspases 3 and 7 as well as annexin V expression. In addition, doxorubicin-encapsulated nanoemulsion exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Cell death was observed following treatment of isolated and cultured rat seminiferous tubules with doxorubicin-encapsulated nanoemulsion. In conclusion, nanoemulsion can be a potential carrier for prolonged release and to enhance activity of doxorubicin that may have utility in non-surgical castration of male animals."
"Community Nurses’ Experiences Regarding the Meaning and Promotion of Healthy Aging in Northeastern Thailand  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.Purpose: Describe community nurses’ experiences regarding the meaning and promotion of healthy aging in northeastern Thailand. Method: Data were collected through five focus group interviews with 36 community nurses in northeastern Thailand. Latent content analysis was conducted to analyze the data. Findings: Healthy aging was characterized by the interconnection of older persons, older persons’ family members, and the community. Healthy aging was associated with two themes: “being strong” and “being a supporter and feeling supported.” The nurses’ experiences in promoting healthy aging were described by the themes “providing health assessment,” “sharing knowledge,” and “having limited resources.” Conclusions: The findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of the meaning of healthy aging from a holistic viewpoint. Community nurses must pay attention to older persons and their surroundings when planning how to promote healthy aging. Person-centeredness should be applied in practice to promote healthy aging. The current findings contribute useful information that should help policy makers develop healthy aging strategies in Thailand."
"Coping with the End of the Commodities Boom: Rubber Smallholders in Southern Thailand Oscillating Between Near-poverty and Middle-class Status  2018,  2018 SAGE Publications.This article focuses on the steep fall in the international natural rubber price and investigates its impact on the socioeconomic situation of rubber smallholders in Southern Thailand, particularly diversification and community development. Based on surveys and semi-structured interviews, this article highlights the vulnerability of rubber smallholders in an upper middle-income country. Despite substantial diversification, volatility in the international rubber price still causes rural households to zigzag back and forth between the classes of near-poverty and accomplished middle class. Consistent diversification is hard to achieve, and there is a lack of local leadership. Current forces in the political economy of rubber are geared toward maintaining the status quo."
"Genome characterization of piscine ‘Scale drop and Muscle Necrosis syndrome’-associated strain of Vibrio harveyi focusing on bacterial virulence determinants  2017 The Society for Applied MicrobiologyAims: Genomic characterization of Harveyi clade vibrio strain Y6 causing ‘Scale drop and Muscle Necrosis syndrome’ (SDMN) isolated from barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in Vietnam. Methods and Results: A bacterial genome was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed that the bacterium belongs to Vibrio harveyi species. Further phylogenetic analysis inferred from core genome SNPs revealed a close relationship between our bacterium and the V. harveyi isolated from groupers in Taiwan and China. blastp results indicated that V. harveyi piscine strains carried numerous adhesin, secretion system, siderophore and toxin-related genes. Genome comparison between Y6 and 32 strains of V. harveyi from different origins showed that at least 17 potential virulence genes were present exclusively in the strain Y6. Many of these (six of 17 genes) were homologous to pyoverdine siderophore, a secreted high-affinity iron chelator, clusters originally found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genome of V. harveyi Y6 was incorporated by a bacteriophage VHY6φ and replication protein of the phage was most similar to CTXφ described previously in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio fischeri. However, the cholera toxin-encoding genes, namely ctxA and ctxB, were absent from VHY6φ, while the CTXφ-enterotoxin gene (zonula occludens toxin; zot) remained intact. Conclusions: Several putative virulence genes and a phage carrying toxin gene were identified in the genomes of SDMN-associated V. harveyi Y6. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study confers genomic information of the piscine pathogenic V. harveyi which recently caused widespread mortality. Such information is of importance to gain insight into bacterial molecular pathogenesis."
"Incense Smoke and Increasing Carotid Intima Media Thickness: A Cross-Sectional Study of the Thai-Vietnamese Community  2018,  2018 APJPH.Incense burning, a source of household indoor air pollution, is possible to effect on cardiovascular system. Our study sought to examine the association of long-term exposure to household incense smoke with increased carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). A cross-sectional study was conducted 132 adults aged ≥35 years. Participants were stratified into 3 groups by their long-term household incense use; nonexposed group, non–daily exposed group, and daily exposed group. A combined mean CIMT (mean difference = 0.04 mm; P <.01) and combined maximum CIMT (mean difference = 0.09 mm; P <.01) in the daily exposed group had greater than the nonexposed group. The mean CIMT and maximum CIMT of the left common carotid artery in the daily exposed group was significantly greater than the nonexposed group (P <.01). These findings suggest that incense burning inside the house may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality."
"Cypripedin, a phenanthrenequinone from Dendrobium densiflorum, sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis  2018, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.The life-threatening potential of lung cancer has increased over the years due to its acquisition of chemotherapeutic resistance, especially to cisplatin, a first-line therapy. In response to this development, researchers have turned their attention to several compounds derived from natural origins, including cypripedin (CYP), a phenanthrenequinone substance extracted from Dendrobium densiflorum. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of CYP to induce apoptosis and enhance cisplatin-mediated death of human lung cancer NCI-H460 cells using cell viability and apoptosis assays. The induction of apoptosis by CYP was observed at a concentration of > 50 μM with the appearance of morphological changes, including DNA condensation and chromatin fragmentation. Together with, CYP was able to activate caspase-3 and downregulate the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Also, a non-cytotoxic dose of CYP synergistically potentiated the effect of cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer line H460 cells, which clearly exhibited the apoptotic phenotype. Western blot analysis revealed that the underlying mechanism involved the downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, whereas the levels of other apoptotic regulatory proteins were not altered. This study provides interesting information on the potent effect of CYP as a chemotherapeutic sensitizer that could be further developed to improve the clinical outcomes of lung cancer patients."
"A novel approved mathematical equation for lightning protection angle  The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.During the past few decades, the lightning protection angle (α) has been proposed through several technical matters, namely graphical technique, numerical data and mathematical equation respectively. Nevertheless, these techniques are very complicated, and are difficult to utilize because they also contain several constraints practically. Hence, this paper proposes a novel equation of the lightning protection angle, which is a simple correlation, concise and easy to be implemented. Furthermore, the reliable result of this equation can confirm accuracy through comparative analysis with all previous techniques. As a result, these solutions are altogether equivalent. This novel equation can analyze the lightning protection angle of the vertical air termination system installed at the vertex of the royal pagoda in a Khema-pirataram temple which is at high risk due to lightning flashes."
"A novel flavanone derivative inhibits dengue virus fusion and infectivity  2018 Elsevier B.V. Dengue infection is a global burden affecting millions of world population. Previous studies indicated that flavanones were potential dengue virus inhibitors. We discovered that a novel flavanone derivative, 5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-methylflavanone (FN5Y), inhibited DENV2 pH-dependent fusion in cell-based system with strong binding efficiency to DENV envelope protein at K (P83, L107, K128, L198), K' (T48, E49, A50, L198, Q200, L277), X' (Y138, V354, I357), and Y' (V97, R99, N103, K246) by molecular dynamic simulation. FN5Y inhibited DENV2 infectivity with EC 50 s (and selectivity index) of 15.99 ± 5.38 (>6.25), and 12.31 ± 1.64 (2.23) μM in LLC/MK2 and Vero cell lines, respectively, and inhibited DENV4 at 11.70 ± 6.04 (>8.55) μM. CC50s in LLC/MK2, HEK-293, and HepG2 cell lines at 72 h were higher than 100 μM. Time-of-addition study revealed that the maximal efficacy was achieved at early after infection corresponded with pH-dependent fusion. Inactivating the viral particle, interfering with cellular receptors, inhibiting viral protease, or the virus replication complex were not major targets of this compound. FN5Y could become a potent anti-flaviviral drug and can be structurally modified for higher potency using simulation to DENV envelope as a molecular target."
"Factors influencing source separation intention and willingness to pay for improving waste management in Bangkok, Thailand  2017 Chinese Institute of Environmental Engineering, TaiwanSource separation for recycling has been recognized as a way to achieve sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management. However, most developing countries including Thailand have been facing with lack of recycling facilities and low level of source separation practice. By employing questionnaire surveys, this study investigated Bangkok residents' source separation intention and willingness to pay (WTP) for improving MSW service and recycling facilities (n = 1076). This research extended the theory of planned behavior to explore the effects of both internal and external factors. The survey highlighted perceived inconvenience and mistrust on MSW collection being major barriers to carrying out source separation in Bangkok. Promoting source separation at workplace may possibly create spill-over effect to people's intention to recycle their waste at home. Both subjective norms and knowledge on MSW situation were found to be a positive correlation with Bangkok residents' source separation intention and WTP (p < 0.001). Besides, the average WTP values are higher than the existing rate of waste collection service, which shows that Bangkok residents have preference for recycling programs. However, the WTP figures are still much lower than the average MSW management cost. These findings suggest that Bangkok Metropolitan Administration targets improving people knowledge on waste problems that could have adverse impact on the economy and well-being of Bangkok residents and improve its MSW collection service as these factors have positive influence on residents' WTP."
"Effects of chito-oligosaccharide supplementation with low or medium molecular weight and high degree of deacetylation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and small intestinal morphology in weaned pigs  2018 Elsevier B.V.Chito-oligosaccharide (COS) supplementation in nursery diets has been found to improve piglets’ performance. However, little is known on which COS characteristics are responsible for its effect. The present study was designed to further study how COS characteristics: molecular weight (MW) and degree of deacetylation (DD); affect the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and small intestinal modifications in weaning pigs. For this purpose, 48 weanling pigs were divided into 4 groups (12 animals per group) and received either a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 150 mg/kg of COS which differed in MW and DD: 8 kDa and ~90% DD (8 kDa~90%), 65 kDa and ~80% DD (65 kDa~80%), and 65 kDa and ~90% DD (65 kDa~90%). The experiment lasted 56 days. There were treatment effects on pigs’ body weight gain (BWG), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), digestibility of crude protein, fat and calcium, small intestinal morphology and crypt cell proliferation (P <.05, respectively). Throughout the study, pigs supplemented with 8 kDa~90% COS showed significantly enhanced BWG, ADG, and ADFI when compared to those supplemented with 65 kDa~80% COS (P <.05, respectively). The enhanced growth performances in pigs supplemented with 8 kDa~90% COS was supported by an increase in ADFI (P <.05), and improved ileal digestibility of crude protein and crude fat (P <.01, respectively). Pigs supplemented with 8 kDa~90% COS also had increased absorption capacity as indicated by elongated villus height and increased villus height to crypt depth ratio of the small intestinal segments (P <.05, respectively), and more active cell division as indicated by increased Ki-67 marker at jejunal crypt cells (P <.05) on day 28 and 56 of the experiment. These data suggest that 8 kDa~90% might be the most effective form of COS to improve feed intake, and promote nutrient digestibility and absorption when supplemented at 150 mg/kg in the diet."
"Gene expression analysis, subcellular localization, and in planta antimicrobial activity of rice (Oryza sativa L.) defensin 7 and 8  2018 Elsevier Masson SASDefensins are a group of plant antimicrobial peptides. In a previous study, it was reported that two recombinant rice (Oryza sativa L.) defensin (OsDEF) genes (OsDEF7 and OsDEF8) produced heterologously by bacteria inhibited the growth of several phytopathogen. Here, we analyzed gene expression patterns in Thai jasmine rice (O. sativa L. ssp. indica ‘KDML 105’) using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and compared them with those in Japanese rice (O. sativa L. ssp. japonica ‘Nipponbare’). Although the cultivars exhibited similar gene expression patterns at the developmental stages examined, the expression levels differed between organs. Upon Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection in the leaves, both OsDEFs were highly upregulated at 8 days post-infection, suggesting that they play a role in pathogen defense. Moreover, in silico analyses revealed that OsDEF expression levels were affected by drought, cold, imbibition, anoxia, and dehydration stress. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions, we found that both OsDEFs were in the extracellular compartment, confirming their functions against pathogen infection. However, when recombinant OsDEFs (without GFP) were produced in tobacco BY-2 cells or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, they could not be detected in either the culture medium or the cells. Yet, N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with OsDEF7 or OsDEF8 constructs exhibited in planta inhibitory activity against the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. glycines, suggesting that recombinant OsDEFs were present. Additionally, when targeting them to the ER compartment, recombinant OsDEFs could be detected. Lower inhibitory activity was observed when recombinant OsDEFs were targeted to the ER. These results suggest that OsDEFs play a role in controlling plant diseases."
"Considerations for placement of mandibular buccal shelf orthodontic anchoring screw in Class III hyperdivergent and normodivergent subjects – A cone beam computed tomography study  2018 Elsevier Ltd and the Japanese Orthodontic SocietyPurpose: The study simulated a mandibular buccal shelf (MBS) orthodontic anchoring screw insertion path and determine the effect of vertical skeletal pattern, insertion site, vertical level and insertion angle on the slope, cortical bone thickness and distance from molar root to the insertion path. Materials and methods: Forty CBCT images of Class III subjects were divided equally into hyperdivergent and normodivergent groups. The slope of the MBS was measured at four different sites of insertion. Cortical bone thickness along the orthodontic anchoring screw insertion path and distance from molar root to the path were measured at different combinations of sites of insertion, vertical levels and insertion angles. Measured outcomes were compared between hypodivergent and normodivergent groups at different combinations of variables using factorial repeated ANOVA. Results: The cortical bone thickness and the slope of the MBS were not different between hyperdivergent and normodivergent groups. However, posterior sites had a flatter slope than that of the anterior. Higher vertical level and insertion angle resulted in thicker cortical bone and higher distance from molar root. The mesial aspect of second molar site gave a higher distance from molar root than first/second molar contact point site. Conclusion: The mesial aspect of the second molar appears to be a safe site for placement of MBS orthodontic anchoring screw as its slope was flatter and gave greater distance from molar root. Increasing vertical level or insertion angle resulted in a higher cortical bone thickness and distance from the molar root."
"Effective surveillance for early classical swine fever virus detection will utilize both virus and antibody detection capabilities  2018 Elsevier B.V.Early recognition and rapid elimination of infected animals is key to controlling incursions of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). In this study, the diagnostic characteristics of 10 CSFV assays were evaluated using individual serum (n = 601) and/or oral fluid (n = 1417) samples collected from −14 to 28 days post inoculation (DPI). Serum samples were assayed by virus isolation (VI), 2 commercial antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), virus neutralization (VN), and 3 antibody ELISAs. Both serum and oral fluid samples were tested with 3 commercial real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. One or more serum samples was positive by VI from DPIs 3 to 21 and by antigen-capture ELISAs from DPIs 6 to 17. VN-positive serum samples were observed at DPIs ≥ 7 and by antibody ELISAs at DPIs ≥ 10. CSFV RNA was detected in serum samples from DPIs 2 to 28 and in oral fluid samples from DPIs 4 to 28. Significant differences in assay performance were detected, but most importantly, no single combination of sample and assay was able to dependably identify CSFV-inoculated pigs throughout the 4-week course of the study. The results show that effective surveillance for CSFV, especially low virulence strains, will require the use of PCR-based assays for the detection of early infections (<14 days) and antibody-based assays, thereafter."
"Successful drug desensitization in patients with delayed-type allergic reactions to anti-tuberculosis drugs  2018 The Author(s)Objective: To evaluate the outcomes of anti-tuberculosis drug desensitization. Methods: This was a retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age >18 years, documented tuberculosis infection, a previous cutaneous allergic reaction to anti-tuberculosis drugs, and having undergone drug desensitization between January 2003 and March 2014. The definition of allergic reaction to anti-tuberculosis drugs included (1) a temporal relationship between drug use and the allergic reaction; (2) improvement in the allergic reaction after drug withdrawal; (3) recurrence of the allergic reaction after reintroduction of only the offending drug; and (4) absence of other causes. Results: A total of 19 desensitization procedures were performed. The drugs used for these procedures were isoniazid (n = 7), rifampicin (n = 6), or ethambutol (n = 6). Of note, severe allergic reactions (Stevens–Johnson syndrome (n = 4), erythema multiforme (n = 3), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic syndrome (n = 1)) were included. All patients underwent resolution of the previous allergic reactions before desensitization. The median duration of desensitization was 18 days. The success rate was 78.9%. The allergic reactions following failed desensitization were not severe; most were maculopapular rashes. Conclusions: The desensitization protocol for anti-tuberculosis drugs was associated with a high success rate, and the individuals who failed desensitization experienced mild allergic reactions."
"Heparin-Bridging Therapy and Risk of Bleeding After Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Gastric Neoplasms: a Meta-Analysis  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: Peri-procedural heparin is recommended as bridging therapy for patients with high thromboembolic risk who need to withhold anticoagulant for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric neoplasms. However, little is known about the bleeding risk from heparin-bridging therapy itself. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched through August 2017 for studies that compared the risk of post-ESD bleeding in patients who received heparin-bridging therapy in lieu of anticoagulant for gastric neoplasms and those who discontinued anticoagulant without receiving heparin. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results: A total of four studies consisting of 350 patients were identified. A significantly increased risk of post-ESD bleeding among the bridged patients compared with the non-bridged patients was observed with the pooled RR of 2.99 (95% CI, 1.51 to 5.92). The statistical heterogeneity was insignificant with I2 of 0%. Conclusions: A significantly increased risk of post-ESD bleeding among patients who received heparin-bridging therapy in lieu of anticoagulant compared to patients who did not receive it was demonstrated in this study."
"Immuno-informatics driven proteome-wide investigation revealed novel peptide-based vaccine targets against emerging multiple drug resistant Providencia stuartii  2018 Elsevier Inc.The bacterium Providencia stuartii, is associated with urinary tract infections and is the most common cause of purple urine bag syndrome. The increasing multi-drug resistance pattern shown by the pathogen and lack of licensed vaccines make treatment of infections caused by P. stuartii challenging. As vaccinology data against the pathogen is scarce, an in silico proteome based Reverse Vaccinology (RV) protocol, in combination with subtractive proteomics is introduced in this work to screen potential vaccine candidates against P. stuartii. The analysis identified three potential vaccine candidates for designing broad-spectrum and strain-specific peptide vaccines: FimD4, FimD6, and FimD8. These proteins are essential for pathogen survival, localized in the outer membrane, virulent, and antigenic in nature. Immunoproteomic tools mapped surface exposed and non-allergenic 9mer B-cell derived T-cell antigenic epitopes for the proteins. The epitopes also show stable and rich interactions with the most predominant HLA allele (DRB1*0101) in the human population. Metabolic pathway annotation of the proteins indicated that fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane usher protein (FimD6) is the most suitable candidate for vaccine design, due to its involvement in several significant pathways. These pathways include: the bacterial secretion system, two-component system, β-lactam resistance, and cationic antimicrobial peptide pathways. The predicted epitopes may provide a basis for designing a peptide-based vaccine against P. stuartii."
"Physical structure variations of bacterial cellulose produced by different Komagataeibacter xylinus strains and carbon sources in static and agitated conditions  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The morphology, crystallinity, crystallite size, and production yield of bacterial cellulose (BC) produced with six different carbon sources (glucose, fructose, lactose, maltitol, sucralose, and xylitol) in static and agitated fermentation conditions by five strains of Komagataeibacter xylinus (KX, TISTR 086, 428, 975, and 1011) which are locally available, were studied. In static condition, the BC pellicle was formed as a membrane sheet at the medium surface exposed to air, while in agitated condition, the spherical or asterisk-like shape BC particles were obtained in the culture media. The XRD and FT-IR analyses found no significant differences in the cellulose crystallinity, crystallite size or polymorphic distribution within the carbon sources. However, changes in crystallinity and mass fraction of the Iα allomorph were observed in BC produced from the different bacterial strains and incubation conditions. The BC samples produced by the same bacterial strain with the varying culture conditions showed the alteration of physical properties more clearly than the BC samples prepared by the opposite situation. These findings suggested that the strains of bacteria and fermentation conditions strongly affected on the physical structures of BC."
"Induction of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-specific regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) in the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes of PRRSV-infected pigs  2018 Elsevier B.V.Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) residing within the tissues, are known to possess immunosuppressive properties which contribute to immunomodulation within the organs. PRRSV infection usually weakens lung defense mechanisms, leading to porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Induction of circulatory Treg is one of the reported mechanisms involved in PRRSV-induced immunomodulation. However, whether PRRSV can induce tissue-infiltrating Treg in the lungs and lymph nodes is still unclear. To investigate the effect of PRRSV on induction of porcine Treg in the tissues, we isolated mononuclear cells from the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and identified the existence of Treg by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that PRRSV could induce Treg proliferation in the cultured mononuclear cells derived from lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, regardless of the pig's PRRSV infective status. Furthermore, PRRSV-infected pigs exhibited higher numbers of total tissue-infiltrating Treg and PRRSV-specific Treg in the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes than the PRRSV-negative pigs. To determine if the lung Treg could produce an inhibitory cytokine, the numbers of IL-10-producing Treg were determined. Significantly higher numbers of IL-10-producing Treg in the lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs were observed. Altogether, our findings indicate the potent effect of PRRSV on induction of Treg in the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes of the infected pigs. The findings expand our understanding in PRRSV immunopathogenesis within the target organs."
"Effect of strong tooth-bleaching with 38% hydrogen peroxide on marginal seal of dental restorations using self-etch and total-etch adhesives  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distance and/or thickness of dye penetration at enamel and cementum/dentin margins of restorations before and after vital bleaching. Class V cavities were prepared on extracted human premolars and restored with light-cured resin composite using either AQ-Bond or Single-Bond2 adhesives. Four conditions: no bleaching (control), restored before bleaching (RB), bleached and immediately restored (BIR), bleached and stored in artificial saliva for 7 days then restored (B7R), were used for each adhesive group. After soaking in basic fuchsin dye for 24 hours, all specimens were vertically sectioned through the middle of restorations to measure the distance and/or the thickness of dye penetration. No microleakage was found either on enamel and cementum/dentin margins of control group using AQ-Bond. Whereas leakage was found in the control group using Single-Bond2 and bleached groups. Statistically significant differences in leakage distance and/or thickness were found among groups at the cementum/dentin margin (P <.05). Dye could penetrate into the pulp chamber of BIR (60%) and B7R (15%) specimens. Clinical Significance: The negative control or leakage-free group is very important when discussing the effects of bleaching on marginal seal or microleakage. Bleaching using 38% H2O2 increases the microleakage distance and dye penetration area of cementum/dentin margin more than that of enamel margin. The bleached tooth is not a good substrate for reliable bonding and complete seal and it is also a channel for external stimuli reaching the pulp."
"Heterologous co-expression in E. coli of isoamylase genes from cassava Manihot esculenta Crantz ‘KU50’ achieves enzyme-active heteromeric complex formation  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.Key message: Cloning of two isoamylase genes, MeISA1 and MeISA2, from cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) tubers, accompanied by their co-expression in E. coli demonstrates a requirement for heteromeric complex formation to achieve debranching activity. Abstract: Starch debranching enzyme (DBE) or isoamylase (ISA) (EC.3.2.1.68), an important enzyme in starch metabolism, catalyses the hydrolysis of α-1,6 glycosidic linkages of amylopectin. Isoforms of ISAs have been reported in higher plants and algae (Fujita et al. in Planta 208:283–293, 1999; Hussain et al. in Plant Cell 15:133–149, 2003; Ishizaki et al. in Agric Biol Chem 47:771–779, 1983; Mouille et al. in Plant Cell 8:1353–1366, 1996). In the current work, cassava ISA genes were isolated from cDNA generated from total RNA from tubers of Manihot esculanta Crantz cultivar KU50. MeISA1 and MeISA2 were successfully amplified and cloned into a pETDuet1 vector. The putative MeISA1 and MeISA2 proteins comprised 763 and 882 amino acids, with substantial similarity to StISA1 and StISA2 from potato (84.4% and 68.9%, respectively). Recombinant MeISA1 and MeISA2 were co-expressed in Escherichia coli SoluBL21 (DE3). HistrapTM-Purified rMeISA1 and rMeISA2 showed approximate molecular weights of 87 and 99 kDa, respectively, by SDS-PAGE. Debranching activity was only detectable in the column fractions where both recombinant ISA isoforms were present. The heteromeric DBE from crude extracts of 4–5 h induced cultures analysed by gel filtration chromatography and western blot showed combinations of rMeISA1 and rMeISA2 at ratios of 1:1 to 4:1. Pooled fractions with DBE activity were used for enzyme characterisation, which showed that the enzyme was specific for amylopectin, with optimum activity at 37 °C and pH 7.0. Enzyme activity was enhanced by Co2+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, but was strongly inhibited by Cu2+. Debranched amylopectin products showed chain length distributions typical of plant DBE."
"Clinical features and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease across the Asia Pacific region—the GO ASIA initiative  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: The Gut and Obesity Asia (GO ASIA) workgroup was formed to study the relationships between obesity and gastrointestinal diseases in the Asia Pacific region. Aim: To study factors associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and advanced fibrosis, and medical treatment of biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Methods: Retrospective study of biopsy-proven NAFLD patients from centres in the GO ASIA Workgroup. Independent factors associated with NASH and with advanced fibrosis on binary logistic regression analyses in a training cohort were used for the development of their corresponding risk score, which were validated in a validation cohort. Results: We included 1008 patients from nine centres across eight countries (NASH 62.9%, advanced fibrosis 17.2%). Independent predictors of NASH were body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, alanine aminotransferase ≥88 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase ≥38 U/L, constituting the Asia Pacific NASH risk score. A high score has a positive predictive value of 80%-83% for NASH. Independent predictors of advanced fibrosis were age ≥55 years, diabetes mellitus and platelet count <150 × 109/L, constituting the Asia-Pacific NAFLD advanced fibrosis risk score. A low score has a negative predictive value of 95%-96% for advanced fibrosis. Only 1.7% of patients were referred for structured lifestyle program, 4.2% were on vitamin E, and 2.4% were on pioglitazone. Conclusions: More severe liver disease can be suspected or ruled out based on factors identified in this study. Utilisation of structured lifestyle program, vitamin E and pioglitazone was limited despite this being a cohort of biopsy-proven NAFLD patients with majority of patients having NASH."
"Contribution of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria to ammonia oxidation in two nitrifying reactors  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In this study, two laboratory nitrifying reactors (NRI and NRII), which were seeded by sludge from different sources and operated under different operating conditions, were found to possess distinct dominant ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) amoA genes outnumbered ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) amoA genes in reactor NRI, while only AOB amoA genes were detectable in reactor NRII. The AOA amoA gene sequences retrieved from NRI were characterized within the Nitrososphaera sister cluster of the group 1.1b Thaumarchaeota. Two inhibitors for ammonia oxidation, allylthiourea (ATU) and 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), were applied individually and as a mixture to observe the ammonia-oxidizing activity of both microorganisms in the reactors’ sludge. The results indicated that AOA and AOB jointly oxidized ammonia in NRI, while AOB played the main role in ammonia oxidation in NRII. DNA-stable isotope probing with labeled 13C–HCO3 − was performed on NRI sludge. Incorporation of 13C into AOA and AOB implied that both microorganisms may perform autotrophy during ammonia oxidation. Taken together, the results from this study provide direct evidence demonstrating the contribution of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation in the nitrifying reactors."
"Controllable encapsulation of α-mangostin with quaternized β-cyclodextrin grafted chitosan using high shear mixing  2017 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the inclusion complex formation between α-mangostin and water-soluble quaternized β-CD grafted-chitosan (QCD-g-CS) was investigated. Inclusion complex formation with encapsulation efficiency (%EE) of 5, 15 and 75% can be varied using high speed homogenizer. Tuning %EE plays a role on physicochemical and biological properties of α-mangostin/QCD-g-CS complex. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that α-mangostin is included within the hydrophobic β-CD cavity and being absorbed on the QCD-g-CS surface, with these results being confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Probing the release characteristics of the inclusion complex at various %EE (5%, 15% and 75%) in simulated saliva (pH 6.8) demonstrated that α-mangostin release rates were dependent on % EE (order 5% > 15% > 75%). Additionally, higher antimicrobial and anti-inflammation activities were observed for the inclusion complex than those of free α-mangostin due to enhance the solubility of α-mangostin through the inclusion complex with QCD-g-CS."
"Peg-interferon and ribavirin treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected patients in Thailand: efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics  2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: In Thailand, 7.2% of HIV patients are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and these patients are treated with peg-interferon + ribavirin (PR) for their HCV infection. This study evaluates efficacy and safety of PR treatment and pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in this population. Methods: HIV/HCV co-infected Thai patients were treated with PR for 24 or 48 weeks. Sustained virological response 24 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR24) was used to describe efficacy. (laboratory) safety parameters and ribavirin plasma concentrations were evaluated during study visits. Ribavirin concentrations were compared with t-tests for patients with and without anaemia (haemoglobin <10 g/dl) and SVR24. Results: A total of 101 HIV/HCV co-infected patients were included; 88% were male (n = 88), and 46% were infected with genotype 3. The median (IQR) start dose was 14.28 mg/kg/day. SVR24 rate was 56%. All patients reported at least one (serious) adverse event, of which 28% of patients developed anaemia. Seven patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity issues. Geometric mean (IQR) ribavirin concentration was 1.81 (1.42–2.32) mg/l at week 8 of treatment. At week 8, patients with and without anaemia and SVR had ribavirin concentrations of 2.29 and 1.63 mg/l and 1.91 and 1.74 mg/l, respectively. Conclusions: PR treatment has comparable response rates and toxicity profile in Thai HIV/HCV co-infected patients as in Western HIV/HCV patients. However, ribavirin plasma concentrations were comparable with previously published studies in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, but both, just as SVR rate, were lower than in mono-infected patients."
"Visible light active photocatalytic C-doped titanium dioxide films deposited via reactive pulsed DC magnetron co-sputtering: Properties and photocatalytic activity  2018 Elsevier LtdDoping of TiO2 with carbon is known to be an efficient method of enhancing visible light photocatalytic activity. The present work describes the deposition of carbon-doped titania coatings deposited by reactive magnetron co-sputtering of Ti and C targets. Undoped titania coatings were produced under similar deposition conditions for comparison purposes. Following deposition, all coatings were annealed in air at 873 K for 30 min to develop the required crystalline structure; and then analysed with EDS, XRD, AFM, XPS and UV–visible spectrophotometry. A number of tests, including methylene blue and stearic acid decomposition tests, and photo-induced hydrophilicity measurements, were employed for the assessment of the photocatalytic properties of the C-doped and un-doped titanium dioxide coatings under UV and visible light irradiation. It was found that carbon-doped titania coatings significantly outperformed undoped titania when using both visible and UV irradiation. Similar trends were observed for other properties. While excessive carbon doping has been shown to have a negative effect on the photocatalytic properties of the titanium dioxide, overall, carbon doping via reactive co-sputtering has been confirmed as an efficient method of photocatalytic property enhancement. This is due to a narrowing of the bandgap and to extended lifetimes of the photo-generated charge carriers."
"Prevalence of and risk factors for cerebral microbleeds among adult patients with haemophilia A or B  2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) represent clinically silent haemorrhagic events. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) portend negative neurovascular and cognitive outcomes in the general population and are associated with cognitive impairment in persons with haemophilia (PWH). Prevalence, patterns, and risk factors for CMBs in PWH have not been directly compared to persons without coagulopathy. Aim: To examine prevalence, patterns, and risk factors for CMBs in PWH vs normal controls. Methods: Adults with haemophilia A or B and haemostatically normal controls were recruited. Subjects were excluded if taking an antithrombotic agent other than low-dose aspirin (<100 mg). All subjects underwent T2*MRI of the brain; scans were reviewed independently by two neuroradiologists blinded to subject group to determine the presence of CMBs. Results: We recruited 31 PWH and 32 controls. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were more prevalent in PWH; smoking was more common among controls. Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors were similar between groups. Prevalence of CMBs was 35% in PWH and 25% in controls (P =.42). Among PWH, advanced age, history of HCV infection, and CV risk factors were associated with CMBs. Multiple and large (>5 mm) CMBs were seen only in PWH. Conclusions: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are common in adults with haemophilia, but not clearly more prevalent than in haemostatically normal controls. In PWH, older age, HCV infection, CV risk factors, and the presence of an inhibitor were associated with CMBs. Large CMBs and multiple CMBs may be more prevalent in PWH than in the general population. The clinical impact of CMBs in PWH requires further study."
"A novel approach of substitution therapy with inhalation of essential oil for the reduction of inhalant craving: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial  2017 Elsevier B.V.Inhalants, which are neurotoxic central nervous system (CNS) suppressants, are frequently abused by young adults. Unlike other CNS depressants, including alcohol and opiates, no treatment is currently approved for inhalant dependence. In this report, a novel approach of substitution treatment for inhalant addiction was explored in a double-blinded, randomized, controlled crossover design to examine the effects of inhalation of essential oil and perfume on the reduction of cue-induced craving for inhalant in thirty-four Thai males with inhalant dependence. The craving response was measured by the modified version of Penn Alcohol Craving Score for Inhalants (PACS-inhalants). The participants (mean age ± SE = 27.9 ± 1.4) in this trial had used inhalant for 5.8 ± 1.1 years. Cravings could be induced in all participants by visual cues as assessed by ^50% increases in inhalant craving levels. Generalized estimating equations showed a significant suppressant effect of essential oil, but not perfume, on the craving response as compared with baseline cue-induced craving. Moreover, essential oil, but not perfume, had significant effects on physiological responses including decreasing pulse rate. It is concluded that inhaling essential oil as a substitution treatment for inhalant may be used as part of treatment programs for reducing inhalant craving."
"Analysis of training data using clustering to improve semi-supervised self-training  2017Applying unlabeled data in semi-supervised self-training can significantly improve the accuracy of a supervised classifier, but in some cases, it may dramatically decrease the classification accuracy. One reason for such degradation is a lack of labeled data for training an initial classifier in the self-training process. In this paper, we propose a method to determine the sufficiency of the labeled data and two methods to improve the labeled dataset in the insufficient portion. To determine the sufficiency of labeled data, we apply a semi-supervised cluster technique to estimate the labeled data distribution over the training set. The results show that the accuracy obtained from the final classifiers in clusters without labeled data is markedly lower than that obtained from clusters with labeled data. The two methods we propose for improving the labeled dataset are active labeling and co-labeling, for ensuring the sufficiency of labeled data. Comparison experiments on UCI and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods are an effective preprocessing step for determining and obtaining a sufficient quantity of labeled data, which is essential for attaining accuracy in a semi-supervised self-training classifier."
"Effects of Hasten Drying and Storage Conditions on Properties and Microstructure of Konjac Glucomannan-Whey Protein Isolate Blend Films  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Impact of drying process and storage conditions on properties of konjac glucomannan (KGM) and whey protein isolate (WPI) blend films was investigated. Hundred grams of film solution contained 0.4 g KGM, 3.8 g WPI and 1.5 g glycerol. During drying process, air velocity was varied to produce fast drying (3 h) and slow drying (15 h) in tray dryers under 50 °C. The high air velocity resulted in a significant higher drying rate in fast drying than low air velocity in slow drying. Drying curves from both processes were well-fitted with Page model and Henderson and Pabis model (R2 ≥ 0.98). Fast drying improved transparency and mechanical properties without impairing color, solubility or water vapor permeability (WVP). Fast-dried film had less surface roughness and contained larger protein clusters. It also had greater melting enthalpy of protein aggregates, implying stronger networks. For stability study, fast-dried film was stored at 4-35 °C for 24 days. Transparency decreased over time. Overall mechanical properties have improved during storage. Color, solubility and WVP did not significantly change over time at all conditions (p > 0.05). Microstructure of aged films was relatively similar to that of the freshly prepared film. Overall, the fast-dried KGM-WPI film exhibited reasonable storage stability."
"Bright light and oxygen therapies decrease delirium risk in critically ill surgical patients by targeting sleep and acid-base disturbances  2017 Elsevier B.V.This study examined the effects of bright light therapy (BLT) on the incidence of delirium in post-operative patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and delineates risk and protective factors. We included 62 patients in a single-blind, randomized controlled study. The intervention group was treated with care as usual plus BLT for three consecutive days. Delirium was diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria with the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Risk factors for delirium were measured, including the APACHE II score, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), as well as hematocrit and bicarbonate levels. Results were adjusted for treatment with nasal cannula oxygen and medications. Thirteen patients developed delirium within the three days following surgery. Generalized estimating equations analysis showed a significant preventive effect of BLT on delirium, which was independent of risk or treatment factors. Higher APACHE-II and ISI scores, lower hematocrit and lower bicarbonate levels increased the risk of developing delirium. BLT plus nasal cannula oxygen significantly reduced the likelihood of delirium. BLT significantly lowered ISI scores, while nasal cannula oxygen significantly enhanced bicarbonate levels. The results indicate that BLT and supplementary oxygen therapy may protect against delirium by targeting sleep-wake and deficits in the bicarbonate buffer system."
"A modeling study of module arrangement and experimental investigation of single stage module for physical absorption of biogas using hollow fiber membrane contactors  2017 Elsevier B.V.In the present work, the effect of module arrangement on the physical absorption of CO2 and H2S in water at high operating pressure using 2 different types of hollow fiber membrane contactor (HFMC) including polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was studied for biogas upgrading application. The simulation was performed at various liquid velocities (0.12–2.0 m/s), pressure differences between liquid and gas phases (0.125–1.0 bar for PVDF and 1.0–5.0 bar for PTFE), operating pressures (1–30 bar) under four different module arrangement scenarios, i.e., (i) single stage module, (ii) multistage module, (iii) multistage module with splitting liquid (α = 0.2 and 0.4) and (iv) multistage module with recycle liquid (φ = 0.5 and 1). The modeling results predicted the significant improvement of CO2 and H2S removal performances when the multistage module was applied for both HFMCs. To obtain the highest removal performance, the suitable liquid velocity, pressure difference between liquid and gas phases and the liquid flow pattern of the module arrangement are the key concerns. For PVDF, the multistage module with splitting liquid (α = 0.2) provides the highest performance at the liquid velocity of 0.12 m/s, pressure difference of 0.125 bar and the operating pressure of 30 bar. For PTFE, at the liquid velocity of 2.0 m/s and the pressure difference of 1.0 bar, the multistage module with recycle liquid (φ = 1) gives the highest performance at the operating pressure of 1–20 bar while the multistage module with splitting liquid (α = 0.4) provides the highest performance at the operating pressure of 30 bar."
"Active Fischer-Tropsch synthesis Fe-Cu-K/SiO2 catalysts prepared by autocombustion method without a reduction step  2017 Science PressThe purpose of this study was to prepare iron-based catalysts supported on silica by autocombustion method for directly using for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) without a reduction step. The effect of different citric acid (CA):iron nitrate (N) molar ratios and acid types on the FTS performance of catalysts were investigated. The CA:N molar ratios had an important influence on the formation of iron active phases and FTS activity. The iron carbide (FexC), which is known to be one of the iron active phases, was demonstrated by the X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Increasing the CA:N molar ratios up to 0.1 increased CO conversion of catalyst to 86.5%, which was then decreased markedly at higher CA:N molar ratios. An excess of CA resulted in carbon residues covering the catalyst surface and declined FTS activity. The optimal catalyst (CA:N molar ratio = 0.1) achieved the highest CO conversion when compared with other autocombustion catalysts as well as reference catalyst prepared by impregnation method, followed by a reduction step. The autocombustion method had the advantage to synthesize more efficient catalysts without a reduction step. More interestingly, iron-based FTS catalysts need induction duration at the initial stage of FTS reaction even after reduction, because metallic iron species need time to be transformed to FexC. But here, even if without reduction, FexC was formed directly by autocombustion and induction period was eliminated during FTS reaction."
"Reproductive aging in male dogs: The epididymal sperm defects and expression of androgen receptor in reproductive tissues  2017 Elsevier Inc.The present study aimed at investigating age-related changes in epididymal sperm motility, morphology, DNA integrity and androgen receptor (AR) expression in canine reproductive tissues. Fifty-five healthy medium-sized male dogs were divided into four groups: young (1 - 3 years old, n = 14), adult (>3 - 6 years old, n = 12), old (>6 - 9 years old, n = 14) and senile (>9 years old, n = 15). After routine castration, testes, epididymides (head, body and tail) and vas deferens were collected. Spermatozoa were flushed from epididymal tails and their motility, morphology and DNA integrity were examined. Localization of AR was investigated by immunohistochemistry and the positive immunostaining cells were evaluated using image analysis software (NuclearQuant, 3DHISTECH). We found significantly lower percentages of epididymal sperm motility, sperm vigour and viability in adult, old and senile dogs in comparison with young dogs (p < 0.05). Animal's age negatively correlated with epididymal sperm motility, sperm vigour and viability. The primary, secondary, major and minor epididymal sperm defects were significantly higher in senile dogs compared to young dogs. There were positive correlations between age and epididymal sperm defects (p < 0.01). The percentage of sperm with fragmented DNA did not differ between age groups. Testicular AR was expressed in the nucleus of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells, except for germ cells. Expression of AR was found in all epithelium, lamina propria and smooth muscle cells of the epididymis and vas deferens. Expression levels of AR in testis, epididymis and vas deferens did not differ between age groups (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the present study clearly demonstrated that senescence in dogs was associated with decreased epididymal sperm quality. An age-related increase in the incidence of poor epididymal sperm quality may promote subfertility, especially in senile dogs."
"A characterization of trace zero bisymmetric nonnegative 5 × 5 matrices  2017 Elsevier Inc.Let λ1≥λ2≥λ3≥λ4≥λ5≥−λ1 be real numbers such that ∑i=15λi=0. In [16], O. Spector proved that a necessary and sufficient condition for λ1,λ2,λ3,λ4,λ5 to be the eigenvalues of a traceless symmetric nonnegative 5×5 matrix is “λ2+λ5≤0 and ∑i=15λi3≥0”. In this article, we show that this condition is also a necessary and sufficient condition for λ1,λ2,λ3,λ4,λ5 to be the spectrum of a traceless bisymmetric nonnegative 5×5 matrix."
"Chronic exposure to low-level cadmium induced zinc-copper dysregulation  2017 Elsevier GmbHBackground and objectives Exposure to cadmium (Cd) has been associated with aberrant zinc and copper homeostasis. This study investigated if Cd exposure impairs renal reabsorption of metals. Methods Renal tubular reabsorption of metals were calculated from urine to serum metal ratios and analyzed for an independent association with Cd exposure levels, using data from 100 men and 100 women, aged 16–60 years. Results The smoking prevalence was 30% in men and 0% in women. The male and female means (SD) for urine Cd were 0.54 (0.43) and 0.62 (0.43) μg/g creatinine. The mean (SD) for fractional zinc reabsorption was 77.2 (23) % in men and 87.7 (13.3) % in women, while the copper reabsorption was 100% in both men and women. Lower zinc reabsorption levels were associated with higher Cd exposure (P < 0.001), higher serum copper to zinc ratios (P = 0.007) and higher tubular impairment levels (P = 0.024). Reduced zinc reabsorption was particularly severe in smokers as those with high Cd exposure had 44.9% and 37.2% (P < 0.001) lower zinc reabsorption than those with low and moderate exposures. The mean zinc reabsorption in male non-smokers with high Cd exposure was 25.8% (P < 0.001) and 18.2% (P = 0.003) lower than those with low and moderate exposures, while the corresponding figure for female non-smokers was 17% (P < 0.001), and 12.8% (P = 0.013), respectively. Conclusions This is the first report demonstrating Cd-dose dependent reduction in renal zinc reabsorption and high serum copper to zinc ratios."
"Controllable nanoporous fibril-like morphology by layer-by- layer self-assembled films of bioelectronics poly(pyrrole-co-formyl pyrrole)/polystyrene sulfonate for biocompatible electrode  2017 Elsevier LtdWe demonstrate a new class of nanocoating materials for biocompatible electrode based on poly (pyrrole-co-formyl pyrrole) (P(Py-co-Fpy)) multilayered with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) using layer by layer (LBL) self-assembly technique. By modulating the number layer of deposition, the unique surface properties of P(Py-co-Fpy) are evaluated for bioaffinity. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) demonstrates the controllable morphology of the degree fibril network structure of P(Py-co-Fpy)/PSS surface. The direct adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) onto the top surface of P(Py-co-Fpy)/PSS film by AFM analysis reveals the forming of BSA multilayer at high degree of fibril structure P(Py-co-Fpy). In addition, the adsorbed fibrinogen (Fgn) reveals the reversible conformation change on surface of P(Py-co-Fpy)/PSS. The effect of P(Py-co-Fpy)/PSS morphology on primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) is investigated. Cell morphology and proliferation on P(Py-co-Fpy)/PSS LBL film at different number of layer deposition are evaluated, demonstrating that P(Py-co-Fpy)/PSS LBL nanocoating surface is non-cytotoxic as morphology-dependent."
"Cone-beam CT in paediatric dentistry: DIMITRA project position statement  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.DIMITRA (dentomaxillofacial paediatric imaging: an investigation towards low-dose radiation induced risks) is a European multicenter and multidisciplinary project focused on optimizing cone-beam CT exposures for children and adolescents. With increasing use of cone-beam CT for dentomaxillofacial diagnostics, concern arises regarding radiation risks associated with this imaging modality, especially for children. Research evidence concerning cone-beam CT indications in children remains limited, while reports mention inconsistent recommendations for dose reduction. Furthermore, there is no paper using the combined and integrated information on the required indication-oriented image quality and the related patient dose levels. In this paper, therefore, the authors initiate an integrated approach based on current evidence regarding image quality and dose, together with the expertise of DIMITRA’s members searching for a state of the art. The aim of this DIMITRA position statement is to provide indication-oriented and patient-specific recommendations regarding the main cone-beam CT applications in the pediatric field. The authors will review this position statement document when results regarding multidisciplinary approaches evolve, in a period of 5 years or earlier."
"Extractive foraging of toxic caterpillars in wild northern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca leonina)  2017, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.Extractive foraging in nonhuman primates may involve different levels of technical complexity in terms of the number of actions that must be performed and the manual dexterity involved. We describe the extractive foraging of caterpillars in wild northern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca leonina) at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. The study group, observed from May to December 2016 (n = 146 days), comprised 60–70 habituated individuals, including 3–4 adult males, 20–23 adult females, and 36–47 immatures. Four adult males and five adult females, observed from September to November 2016 for a total of 24 days, were selected for focal animal sampling. Northern pig-tailed macaques were observed eating at least two families (Erebidae and Limacodidae) and three genera (Macrobrochis sp., Phlossa sp. and Scopelodes sp.) of caterpillars. While the monkeys ate short and small caterpillars with stinging setae and non-setae caterpillars without processing, they performed extensive caterpillar-rubbing behavior on large and long caterpillars with stinging setae. Based on 61 extractive foraging bouts, we found that caterpillar rubbing was hierarchically organized into five stages and 12 elements. Five stages of behavior sequence started with picking the caterpillar up, transporting it to a substrate, rubbing it to remove stinging setae, ingesting it, and then cleaning hands and mouth. Only adult macaques were observed using a leaf to rub stinging caterpillars."
"Gas Sparger Orifice Sizes and Solid Particle Characteristics in a Bubble Column – Relative Effect on Hydrodynamics and Mass Transfer  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe relative effects of the size of gas sparger orifices and properties of solid particles on gas-liquid mass transfer are not yet fully understood. Here, the impact of sparger orifice sizes, solid particle shapes, and their loading amounts in a bubble column reactor on the absorption of oxygen in tap water was investigated. Their influence on the mass transfer coefficient and bubble hydrodynamic parameters was evaluated. The results show that the addition of solid particles can have both positive and negative effects on hydrodynamics and mass transfer, depending on the orifice size of the gas sparger. The introduction of ring-shaped solid particles can improve the mass transfer rate by up to 28 % without requiring any significant additional power."
"DETERMINANTS AND BARRIERS TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN MYANMAR: WHAT DETERMINES ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES AND WHAT HINDERS IT?  2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.This paper examines two aspects of financial inclusion in the context of Myanmar. First, it examines the factors that determine access to formal savings products. Second, it looks at what the barriers to saving are. Using data from a nationally representative survey of 5100 individuals, the paper applies econometric estimation and qualitative data analysis methods to provide answers to these questions. Findings show a low level of saving in Myanmar, and that formal savings increase with income, education, and keeping a budget, among other factors. Policy recommendations include the design of financial literacy programs that are suitable to the Myanmar context, and providing access to financial services."
"The current status of Aureobasidium pullulans in biotechnology  2017, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.Different strains of the saprophytic yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans (Ascomycota: Dothideales) exhibit different biochemical characteristics, while their ubiquitous occurrence across diverse habitats and environmental conditions makes them an easily accessible source for biotechnological exploitation. They are useful in agricultural and industrial applications. Their antagonistic activities against postharvest pathogens make them suitable bioagents for the postharvest preservation of fruits and vegetables, while they possess antimicrobial activities against bacteria and fungi. Additionally, A. pullulans appears to be a potent source of single-cell protein. Many strains of A. pullulans harbor a wide range of industrially important enzymes, while the trademark exopolysaccharide pullulan that they produce has been extensively studied and is currently used in many applications. They also produce poly (β-l-malic acid), heavy oil liamocins, siderophore, and aubasidan-like β-glucan which are of interest for future applications. Ongoing studies suggest that A. pullulans holds many more interesting properties capable of further potential biotechnological applications."
"Natural Calcium-Based Residues for Carbon Dioxide Capture in a Bubbling Fluidized-Bed Reactor  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimUsed clamshells (Paphia undulata), as a precursor of calcium oxide (CaO) sorbents, were employed for carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor. To find the optimal calcination conditions, a 2k experimental design was used to vary the ground clamshell particle size, heating rate, and calcination time at 950 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The heating rate was the most significant factor affecting the CO2 adsorption capacity of the obtained CaO sorbent. The maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of the CaO obtained under these study conditions was higher than that of commercial CaO."
"Contributions of gaming simulation in building community-based disaster risk management applying Japanese case to flood prone communities in Thailand upstream area  2017 Elsevier LtdThailand has a long history of flood disasters. The Great Flood in 2011, for example, affected many parts of the country, including Bangkok. This obviously revealed the limitations of disaster management by the government. Movements in responding and helping communities to manage against flood disasters are still ambiguous and rudimentary; while local communities still rely on external support. This study aims to strengthen community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) by using gaming simulation (GS) as a tool. This is participatory action research (PAR) using empirical data from applying GS, participatory observation and interviews in selected communities. Three flood prone communities in an upstream province in Thailand that represent successful case, on-going case and non-active case in building CBDRM used as case studies. The GS named ‘Community Cooperation Game’ (CCG) was designed as a prototype in a Japanese case study on flood management in Sonobe District, Kyoto Prefecture. The CCG was applied in the three flood prone communities in Thailand; that enabled these three communities to simulate flood situations and make mutual decisions on how to manage flood scenarios by following roles, rules and scenarios of the game. The main findings of this study are 1) a list of GS contributions in achieving CBDRM process indicators; and 2) evidence that suggest that GS can be used as a valuable tool to build CBDRM process by promoting social resilience through CCG in local communities in Thailand. The research concludes that the prototype of CCG on building CBDRM can be generalized in Thai local communities."

"Why did Rikuzentakata have a high death toll in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami disaster? Finding the devastating disaster's root causes  2017 Elsevier LtdThis paper aims to identify the root causes that exacerbated the loss of life from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (GEJET) disaster in one of the local municipalities, Rikuzentakata. Finding root causes is crucial for learning from disasters; however, there has not been much investigation of the root causes with regard to the GEJET disaster. This paper seeks to investigate systematically the root causes of the loss of life by organizing the existing analytical frameworks, tools and approaches in order to clarify why Rikuzentakata experienced such a high death toll. The study's research design includes a social background survey, an in-depth interview survey and an investigation of the disaster's root causes. Through the research design, inappropriate regional development and urbanization, inadequate tsunami countermeasures in the area and misguided belief systems based on aged memories of the local people have been identified as root causes for the high death toll in Rikuzentakata. This study also provides four key points essential to building resilient communities: 1) education and training to consider local people's misguided belief system using their own memories and excess reliance on infrastructure and warning systems; 2) land-use considerations regarding regional development and urbanization; 3) learning lessons from previous disaster risk-management efforts to confirm tsunami countermeasures in the area; and 4) countermeasures for the elderly to harmonize with an aging society."
"Media use and psychosocial adjustment in children and adolescents  2017 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)Aims: Currently, television and new forms of media are readily available to children and adolescents in their daily lives. Excessive use of media can lead to negative physical and psychosocial health effects. This study aimed to describe children's media use, including media multitasking, as well as the associations between media use and their psychosocial adjustment. Methods: This study recruited 339 participants aged 10–15 years from an international school. The children and their care givers were asked to complete the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire independently to evaluate the psychosocial problems of the children. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 12.4 ± 1.5 years, who were recruited from grades 5 to 9. Multitasking media use was reported in 59.3% of participants. The average total media exposure time was 7.0 h/day. The behavioural problem scores from self-reports were greater with increased media use time. After adjusting for confounding variables, the school report and sleep problems were among the factors associated with the total behavioural problem scores from the multiple linear regression analysis (P = 0.001 and <0.001, respectively), whereas age and average total media exposure time were significantly associated with the prosocial behaviour scores reported by the children (P = 0.004 and 0.02, respectively). Multitasking media use was not significantly associated with the total difficulties scores or the prosocial behaviour scores in this study. Conclusion: Increased media use time was significantly associated with decreased prosocial behaviour scores in children in this study. This can provide important information to parents regarding media use in children."
Underground excavation behaviour in Bangkok using three-dimensional finite element method  2017 Elsevier LtdThis study provides evidence that three-dimensional finite element modelling can be effectively applied for deep excavation analysis in Bangkok. The Bangkok subsoils were modelled using the hardening soil model and their parameters were calibrated against the results of laboratory and field tests. A study of a MRT station excavation was initially used to validate the model. The predicted wall movements and surface settlements were compared with the instrument data and two-dimensional analysis from a previous study. Another deep excavation project was selected as an independent study. The result shows that the model can be confidently used for deep excavation analysis.
"Inhibition of TNF- α -Induced Inflammation by Sesquiterpene Lactones from Saussurea lappa and Semi-Synthetic Analogues  Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.We investigated the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) inhibitory activity of sesquiterpenes from Saussurea lappa root extracts. According to the hexane and EtOAc extracts showing significant activity with IC 50 values of 0.5 and 1.0 μg/mL, respectively, chromatographic fractionation of the extracts was performed and led to the isolation of 10 sesquiterpenes (1 - 10). Costunolide (1), a major compound, and dehydrocostus lactone (4) exhibited high efficiency in decreasing TNF- α levels, with IC 50 values of 2.05 and 2.06 μM, respectively. In addition, sesquiterpene analogues were synthesized to establish their structure-activity relationship (SAR) profile. Among the semi-synthetic analogues, compounds 6a and 16 showed the most potent activity with IC 50 values of 1.84 and 1.97 μM, respectively. More importantly, compound 6a showed less toxicity than costunolide and 16. These results provided the first SAR profile of sesquiterpene lactones and indicated that the α -methylene- γ -lactone moiety plays a crucial role in TNF- α inhibition. Additionally, the epoxide derivative 6a might represent a lead compound for further anti-TNF- α therapies, owing to its potent activity and reduced toxicity."
"Randomized control trial of benzydamine HCl versus sodium bicarbonate for prophylaxis of concurrent chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of benzydamine HCl with sodium bicarbonate in the prevention of concurrent chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients. Methods: Sixty locally advanced head and neck cancer patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either benzydamine HCl or sodium bicarbonate from the first day of treatment to 2 weeks after the completion of treatment. The total score for mucositis, based on the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS), was used for the assessment, conducted weekly during the treatment period and at the fourth week of the follow-up. Pain score, all prescribed medications, and tube feeding needs were also recorded and compared. Results: The median of total OMAS score was statistically significant lower in patients who received benzydamine HCl during concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) than in those who received sodium bicarbonate, (p value < 0.001). There was no difference in median pain score, (p value = 0.52). Nineteen percent of patients in sodium bicarbonate arm needed oral antifungal agents whereas none in the benzydamine HCl arm required such medications, (p value = 0.06). Tube feeding needs and the compliance of CCRT were not different between the two study arms. Conclusions: For patients undergoing high-dose radiotherapy concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy, using benzydamine HCl mouthwash as a preventive approach was superior to basic oral care using sodium bicarbonate mouthwash in terms of reducing the severity of oral mucositis and encouraging trend for the less need of oral antifungal drugs."
"Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Black Liquor Xylan by a Novel Xylose-Tolerant, Thermostable β-Xylosidase from a Tropical Strain of Aureobasidium pullulans CBS 135684  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.From three cell-associated β-xylosidases produced by Aureobasidium pullulans CBS 135684, the principal enzyme was enriched to apparent homogeneity and found to be active at high temperatures (60–70 °C) over a pH range of 5–9 with a specific activity of 163.3 units (U) mg−1. The enzyme was thermostable, retaining over 80% of its initial activity after a 12-h incubation at 60 °C, with half-lives of 38, 22, and 10 h at 60, 65, and 70 °C, respectively. Moreover, it was tolerant to xylose inhibition with a Ki value of 18 mM. The Km and Vmax values against p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside were 5.57 ± 0.27 mM and 137.0 ± 4.8 μmol min−1 mg−1 protein, respectively. When combining this β-xylosidase with xylanase from the same A. pullulans strain, the rate of black liquor xylan hydrolysis was significantly improved by up to 1.6-fold. The maximum xylose yield (0.812 ± 0.015 g g−1 dry weight) was obtained from a reaction mixture containing 10% (w/v) black liquor xylan, 6 U g−1 β-xylosidase and 16 U g−1 xylanase after incubation for 4 h at 70 °C and pH 6.0."
"Predictive role of serum HBsAg and HBcrAg kinetics in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B receiving pegylated interferon–based therapy  2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious DiseasesObjectives: To investigate the role of serum hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) kinetics in predicting long-term outcome of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-based therapy in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods: A total of 121 Thai patients with HBeAg-negative CHB recruited from a previous randomized trial of 48-week PEG-IFN alone or combined with entecavir were enrolled. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBcrAg levels were serially examined. Paired biopsy samples taken at baseline and after treatment were assessed for intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Results: Persistent virologic remission (PVR, defined by persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA <2000 IU/mL) and HBsAg clearance at 3 years after treatment were 29% (35/121) and 9% (11/121) respectively. Baseline HBcrAg correlated with HBV DNA and cccDNA but not with HBsAg. Baseline HBsAg, as well as HBsAg and HBcrAg, declines were associated with PVR, while HBsAg decline was predictive of HBsAg clearance. High baseline antigen levels (HBsAg ≥3.4 log10 IU/mL plus HBcrAg ≥3.7 log10 U/mL) yielded high negative predictive values of PVR (45/50, 90%) and HBsAg clearance (50/50, 100%). At week 12, declines of HBsAg, HBcrAg and both antigens combined of <0.5 log10 yielded negative predictive values for PVR of 90% (71/79), 82% (61/74) and 96% (48/50) respectively. Conclusions: Quantitative HBcrAg was significantly associated with cccDNA in HBeAg-negative CHB. This novel antigen, together with HBsAg, could identify patients with low probability of PVR and HBsAg clearance in long-term follow-up."
"Numerical Analysis and Experiments on the Electromechanical Behavior of Wired-Shape Conducting Particles  2017 IEEE.This paper presents the numerical analysis and experiments on the electromechanical behavior of conducting wired-shape particles. We investigate the effects of particle ending profiles and orientation on the initial motion. The boundary element method is used to analyze the electric field, forces, and torques on the particles. The calculated liftoff electric field is smaller than the estimated value based on a model of infinitely long cylinder, and slightly decreases for a particle with a sharp end when the sharp tip is separated from the electrode. The measured liftoff electric field agrees with the tendency obtained from the numerical analysis. Particles mostly began the motion at either end. When the sharp tip was separated from the electrode, the initial motion almost exclusively took place at the sharp end. On the other hand, the probability was slightly higher for the motion at the rounded end when the sharp tip was close to the electrode. The numerical calculation clarifies that the electrostatic and gravitational torques contribute to such liftoff behavior."
"Detection of an unknown trypanosoma DNA in a Phlebotomus stantoni (Diptera: Psychodidae) Collected From Southern Thailand and Records of New Sand Flies With Reinstatement of Sergentomyia hivernus Raynal & Gaschen, 1935 (Diptera: Psychodidae)  The Authors 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America. All rights reserved.Although female sand flies are best known as the vectors of Leishmania parasites and viruses, several previous reports have demonstrated that these insects can also act as vectors for the trypanosomes of bats, lizards, and snakes. In this report, we created an inventory of Phlebotomine sand flies from southern Thailand. A novel tryp-anosome was found in a specimen of Phlebotomus stantoni, and two sand fly species newly recorded in the country, Sergentomyia khawi and Sergentomyia hivernus, were described. PCR primer pairs specific for the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) gene of trypanosomatids were used to demonstrate the presence of the parasite in the sand fly. In addition, the Cytochrome b (CytB) gene was used to identify the sand fly species. Among the 45 samples of the sand fly that were collected, seven samples were Ph. stantoni sand flies and a single sample was positive for Trypanosoma sp. through PCR analysis. This study represents the first detection of Trypanosoma sp. in a sand fly from Thailand. The ITS1 and SSU rDNA sequences indicated that this specimen is suspected to be a novel Trypanosoma species. Further studies of this suspected new Trypanosoma species, including its vertebrate hosts and pathogenic potential, are therefore necessary."
"Patient-reported outcome measures in oral lichen planus: A comprehensive review of the literature with focus on psychometric properties and interpretability  2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: To review the range of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used in clinical studies of patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) and to assess their psychometric properties and interpretability. Methods: Literature searches were performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases (1990–September 2016) to retrieve relevant studies related to the development, psychometric testing and/or use of PROMs assessing oral symptoms, psychosocial status and quality of life in individuals with OLP. The identified PROMs were then categorised by concept measured and assessed for instrument characteristics and evidence for psychometric properties and interpretability. Results: We identified a total of 41 PROMs used in clinical studies for the assessment of patient-reported outcomes in patients with OLP. There were three PROMs of oral symptoms, 30 PROMs of psychosocial status and eight PROMs of quality of life. Six instruments (Visual Analog Scale, Numerical Rating Scale, Change in Symptom Scale, Oral Health Impact Profile-14, Oral Health-related Quality of Life-UK and Chronic Oral Mucosal Disease Questionnaire) demonstrated some evidence of psychometric properties but no evidence for interpretability of their results in the OLP population. Conclusion: The range of PROMs used in clinical studies of patients with OLP is wide and include instruments for oral symptoms, psychosocial status and quality of life. The vast majority of these instruments have no evidence of psychometric properties and interpretability for patients with OLP. Further qualitative and validation studies are required to investigate whether these instruments are appropriate for use in this patient population."
"Relationship Between Noise-Related Risk Perception, Knowledge, and the Use of Hearing Protection Devices Among Para Rubber Wood Sawmill Workers  2017 The AuthorsBackground: The understanding of the relationship between risk perception, knowledge, and protective behaviors could play a major role in occupational risk control and management. Research exploring how workers perceive, recognize, and react to risks in different occupational settings is scarce in Thailand. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of noise-related risk perceptions and knowledge to the use of hearing protective devices (HPDs) among sawmill workers in Thailand. Methods: Sawmill workers (n = 540) from four factories in Trang, Southern Thailand, participated in a questionnaire interview from December 2015 to January 2016. Descriptive statistics and linear regression models were used to explore the risk factors related to HPD use. Path diagram analysis was demonstrated and used to evaluate associations. Results: Risk perception was significantly correlated with HPD use (p < 0.01), HPD training (p = 0.01), and the number of years of work experience (p = 0.03). Sawmill workers were likely to use HPDs based on their risk perception and HPD training. However, HPD training was inversely correlated with age and the number of years of work experience. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of risk perceptions and knowledge, and these factors should be emphasized in the design and implementation of any personal safety intervention program for sawmill workers."
"Can the first letter advantage be shaped by script-specific characteristics?  2017 American Psychological Association.We examined whether the first letter advantage that has been reported in the Roman script disappears, or even reverses, depending on the characteristics of the orthography. We chose Thai because it has several ""nonaligned"" vowels that are written prior to the consonant but phonologically follow it in speech (e.g., <ε:fn> is spoken as /fε:n/) whereas other ""aligned"" vowels are written and spoken in a corresponding order, as occurs in English (e.g., <fa:k> is spoken as /fa:k/). We employed the forced choice decision paradigm of Adelman, Marquis, and Sabatos-DeVito (2010) to examine letter identification across letter positions in 3-and 4-letter Thai legal nonword pairs. Results showed an advantage of the initial letter position for the aligned legal nonwords, as occurs in Roman script (e.g., Scaltritti & Balota, 2013). However, for the nonaligned legal nonwords, an advantage of second letter position was found which is in line with the characteristics of these types of stimuli: the critical initial consonant occurs in the second letter position. These results highlight the importance of the initial phonological letter in Thai, which is crucial for mapping orthography to phonology and for lexical access. In conclusion, these results illustrate that initial letter advantage can be shaped by the characteristics of the orthography."
"Performance and environmental study of a biogas-fuelled solid oxide fuel cell with different reforming approaches  2017 Elsevier LtdIn this work, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using biogas as the fuel with two different reforming approaches, i.e., external and internal reforming, were studied to determine the optimal operation conditions for each approach. Thermodynamic analysis was performed using a flowsheet simulator. The equilibrium gas composition was calculated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy. An electrochemical model that includes three voltage losses (i.e., activation, ohmic, and concentration losses) was used to predict the performance of the SOFCs. The simulation results showed that the reformer in the external reforming SOFC should be operated at a temperature of 973 K, a pressure of 1 atm, and a steam-to-carbon molar ratio of 0.5. In performance analysis, the simulation results indicated that both approaches have the same optimal operating conditions, i.e. a temperature of 1173 K, a pressure of 3 atm, and a current density of 5000 A/m2. Under the same operating conditions, the internal reforming SOFC exhibited better electrical efficiency than that of the external reforming SOFC. Considering the CO2 and CO emissions, the exhaust gas obtained from the anode side of the internal reforming SOFC contained 7.4% CO2 and 37.9% CO, which are higher values than those for the external reforming SOFC (1.9% CO2 and 32.5% CO)."
"Preparation and characterization of electrospun polyacrylonitrile fiber mats containing Garcinia mangostana  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.Garcinia mangostana-loaded electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber mats with antibacterial and anti-tuberculosis properties were fabricated from PAN solution containing G. mangostana extract in dimethylformamide. 10% PAN solution was mixed with G. mangostana in amounts of 10, 15, 20, and 30 wt% based on the weight of PAN powder used in the experiment. The PAN solutions were processed using the electrospinning process. Both untreated (neat) and G. mangostana-loaded PAN fibers were smooth in appearance, and the average diameter of samples was ~215 and ~245 nm, respectively. Morphologies, release characteristics, antimicrobial efficiencies against Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and anti-tuberculosis properties of the neat electrospun and 10–30% G. mangostana-loaded e-spun fiber mats were investigated. In vitro release studies of G. mangostana from e-spun PAN fiber mats were determined using the total immersion method in acetate buffer and phosphate buffer solutions containing Tween 80 and methanol. The cumulative released amount of G. mangostana from the samples proportionally increased with the increase of G. mangostana incorporated in the spinning solutions. This study demonstrated a convenient procedure with the potential to develop the antimicrobial and anti-tuberculosis properties of electrospun fibrous membranes containing G. mangostana, which are beneficial in filtration applications for respirators, face masks, and air-conditioning filters."
"Shrimp humoral responses against pathogens: antimicrobial peptides and melanization  2017 Elsevier LtdDiseases have caused tremendous economic losses and become the major problem threatening the sustainable development of shrimp aquaculture. The knowledge of host defense mechanisms against invading pathogens is essential for the implementation of efficient strategies to prevent disease outbreaks. Like other invertebrates, shrimp rely on the innate immune system to defend themselves against a range of microbes by recognizing and destroying them through cellular and humoral immune responses. Detection of microbial pathogens triggers the signal transduction pathways including the NF-κB signaling, Toll and Imd pathways, resulting in the activation of genes involved in host defense responses. In this review, we update the discovery of components of the Toll and Imd pathways in shrimp and their participation in the regulation of shrimp antimicrobial peptide (AMP) synthesis. We also focus on a recent progress on the two most powerful and the best-studied shrimp humoral responses: AMPs and melanization. Shrimp AMPs are mainly cationic peptides with sequence diversity which endues them the broad range of activities against microorganisms. Melanization, regulated by the prophenoloxidase activating cascade, also plays a crucial role in killing and sequestration of invading pathogens. The progress and emerging research on mechanisms and functional characterization of components of these two indispensable humoral responses in shrimp immunity are summarized and discussed. Interestingly, the pattern recognition protein (PRP) crosstalk is evidenced between the proPO activating cascade and the AMP synthesis pathways in shrimp, which enables the innate immune system to build up efficient immune responses."
"Prevalence and associated factors of obstructive sleep apnea in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Purpose: Our goal in this study is to determine the prevalence and associated factors of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods: This descriptive study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from 2007 to 2015. Data of morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery were included using ICD-10 code for principle diagnosis “morbid obesity” (E668) and ICD-9 code for “bariatric surgery” (4389, 4438, 4439). Results: Baseline characteristics of 238 patients who met the inclusion criteria demonstrated 49.2% male, mean age of 33.9 ± 10.8 years, and mean BMI of 52.6 ± 11.6. Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery were performed in 51.5 and 48.5%; respectively. High risk for OSA using STOP-Bang as a screening questionnaire (≥3 points) was 92.7%. The prevalence of OSA using respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≥ 5 was demonstrated at 85.7%. Mild, moderate, and severe OSA was observed in 8.8, 15.3, and 75.9%, respectively. Snoring, STOP-Bang score ≥ 3, fatty liver, and BMI were significantly correlated with OSA compared to the group without OSA with the odds ratio of 17.04 (p = OpenSPiltSPi0.0001, 95% CI = 6.67–43.49), 16 (p = 0.01, 95% CI = 1.95–131.11), 4.75 (p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.82–12.37), and 1.04 (p = 0.045, 95% CI = 1.0009–1.09), respectively. Comparison between non-severe and severe OSA groups demonstrated dyslipidemia and BMI to be correlated with OSA severity (odds ratio = 3.06, 95% CI 1.36–6.89, p = 0.007 and odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.13, p = 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is frequently observed in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery and the severity tends to be severe. Snoring, STOP-Bang score ≥ 3, fatty liver, and BMI were significantly correlated with OSA. Dyslipidemia and BMI were demonstrated to be associated factors for severity of OSA in this population."
"Optimization of CO2 adsorption capacity and cyclical adsorption/desorption on tetraethylenepentamine-supported surface-modified hydrotalcite  2017The objective of this research was to investigate CO2 adsorption capacity of tetraethylenepentamine-functionalized basic-modified calcined hydrotalcite (TEPA/b-cHT) sorbents at atmospheric pressure formed under varying TEPA loading levels, temperatures, sorbent weight to total gaseous flow rate (W/F) ratios and CO2 concentrations in the influent gas. The TEPA/b-cHT sorbents were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT–IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) analysis of nitrogen (N2) adsorption/desorption and carbon–hydrogen–nitrogen (CHN) elemental analysis. Moreover, a full 24 factorial design with three central points at a 95% confidence interval was used to screen important factor(s) on the CO2 adsorption capacity. It revealed that 85.0% variation in the capacity came from the influence of four main factors and the 15.0% one was from their interactions. A face-centered central composite design response surface method (FCCCD–RSM) was then employed to optimize the condition, the maximal capacity of 5.5–6.1 mmol/g was achieved when operating with a TEPA loading level of 39%–49% (W/W), temperature of 76–90°C, W/F ratio of 1.7–2.60 (g·sec)/cm3 and CO2 concentration of 27%–41% (V/V). The model fitted sufficiently the experimental data with an error range of ± 1.5%. From cyclical adsorption/desorption and selectivity at the optimal condition, the 40%TEPA/b-cHT still expressed its effective performance after eight cycles."
"Deficit Schizophrenia Is Characterized by Defects in IgM-Mediated Responses to Tryptophan Catabolites (TRYCATs): a Paradigm Shift Towards Defects in Natural Self-Regulatory Immune Responses Coupled with Mucosa-Derived TRYCAT Pathway Activation  2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Deficit schizophrenia is accompanied by mucosa-associated activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway, as indicated by increased IgA responses to noxious (NOX) TRYCATs, but not regulatory or protective (PRO) TRYCATs, suggesting increased neurotoxic, excitotoxic, inflammatory, and oxidative potential. No previous studies examined IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to the TRYCAT pathway in deficit versus nondeficit schizophrenia. We measured IgM responses to NOX TRYCATs, namely, quinolinic acid (QA), 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), picolinic acid (PA), and xanthurenic (XA) acid, and PRO TRYCATs, including kynurenic acid (KA) and anthranilic acid (AA), in 40 healthy controls and 40 deficit and 40 nondeficit schizophrenic patients. We computed the IgM responses to NOX (QA + PA + 3HK + XA)/PRO (AA + KA) ratio and ∆ differences in IgA − IgM TRYCAT values and NOX/PRO ratio. Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by significantly attenuated IgM responses to all TRYCATs and NOX/PRO ratio and highly increased ∆IgA − IgM NOX/PRO ratio as compared to nondeficit schizophrenia and healthy controls. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are significantly and positively associated with increased IgM responses directed against the KA/3HK ratio and ∆IgA − IgM NOX/PRO ratio. The findings support the view that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct subtype of schizophrenia that may be significantly discriminated from nondeficit schizophrenia. Deficit schizophrenia is accompanied by a highly specific defect in IgM isotype-mediated regulatory responses directed to the TRYCAT pathway. Lowered IgM regulatory responses together with mucosa-derived activation of the TRYCAT pathway may contribute to neuroprogression, negative symptoms, and deficit schizophrenia. All in all, a highly specific defect in the compensatory (anti-)inflammatory reflex system (CIRS), namely, natural IgM-mediated regulatory responses, may underpin deficit schizophrenia."
"Electrospinning: A carbonized gold/graphene/PAN nanofiber for high performance biosensing  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this study, a novel biosensor was produced from a carbonized gold (Au)/graphene (G) hybrid nanowire fabricated on a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) in order to amplify signals. The processes of carbonization and electrospinning were merged in order to determine dopamine (DA) in a selective and sensitive manner when it is present in uric acid (UA) or ascorbic acid (AA). In order to assess the nature of the surface morphology and the physical product properties, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction were employed prior to and following the carbonization step. The modified electrode (CPAN-Au/G) in [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- and DA was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in order to establish the electrochemical behavior. The findings from this test revealed that the modified electrode was capable of selectively identifying DA in 0.1 M PBS at pH 7.4 when other substances were present to provide interference. This process did not require the use of an anionic surfactant to serve as the discriminating agent. From the analysis of the DPV current, a linear dependence upon DA concentrations became apparent, in the range of 0.001-60 μM when the detection limit was 0.8 nM (S/N = 3) and sensitivity was 1.4351 μA cm-2. DA quantities in human serum could be effectively detected using the CPAN-Au/G electrode, and the modified electrode raises considerable expectations for application as a high-potential electrode. This would permit the determination of DA in a selective and sensitive manner while achieving sensor stability over the long term."
"Influence of graphene on electromechanical responses of plasticized poly(lactic acid)  2018Electro-responsive materials were fabricated from poly(lactic) acid (PLA), incorporated with dibutyl phthalate (DBP) as a plasticizer and graphene nanoplatelet as an effective nanofiller, via solvent casting method. The electromechanical properties and deflection of MG/PLA/DBP composites were investigated under the effects of graphene concentration and electric field strength. All composites possessed good recoverability during the temporal response experiment under applied electric field. At the 0.1%v/v graphene, the composite exhibited the highest storage modulus sensitivity (ΔG′/G′0) value of 1.88 at the electric filed strength of 1.5 kV/mm. At the graphene concentration of 1.0%v/v, the storage modulus response (ΔG′) became negative definite, where the storage modulus under electric field (G′) was lower than the G′0 value. The negative ΔG′ under electric field at room temperature has not been previously reported for any electrosrictive materials. Moreover, the pristine PLA/DBP showed the highest deflection distance and dielectrophoresis force relative to the composites at the electric filed strength of 550 V/mm, but the deflection distance of the composites decreased with graphene concentration."
"Observation of Correlated Azimuthal Anisotropy Fourier Harmonics in pp and p+Pb Collisions at the LHC  2018 CERN.The azimuthal anisotropy Fourier coefficients (vn) in 8.16 TeV p+Pb data are extracted via long-range two-particle correlations as a function of the event multiplicity and compared to corresponding results in pp and PbPb collisions. Using a four-particle cumulant technique, vn correlations are measured for the first time in pp and p+Pb collisions. The v2 and v4 coefficients are found to be positively correlated in all collision systems. For high-multiplicity p+Pb collisions, an anticorrelation of v2 and v3 is observed, with a similar correlation strength as in PbPb data at the same multiplicity. The new correlation results strengthen the case for a common origin of the collectivity seen in p+Pb and PbPb collisions in the measured multiplicity range."
"One-step genetic correction of hemoglobin E/beta-thalassemia patient-derived iPSCs by the CRISPR/Cas9 system  2018 The Author(s).Background: Thalassemia is the most common genetic disease worldwide; those with severe disease require lifelong blood transfusion and iron chelation therapy. The definitive cure for thalassemia is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is limited due to lack of HLA-matched donors and the risk of post-transplant complications. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offers prospects for autologous cell-based therapy which could avoid the immunological problems. We now report genetic correction of the beta hemoglobin (HBB) gene in iPSCs derived from a patient with a double heterozygote for hemoglobin E and β-thalassemia (HbE/β-thalassemia), the most common thalassemia syndrome in Thailand and Southeast Asia. Methods: We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target the hemoglobin E mutation from one allele of the HBB gene by homology-directed repair with a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide template. DNA sequences of the corrected iPSCs were validated by Sanger sequencing. The corrected clones were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor and erythroid cells to confirm their multilineage differentiation potential and hemoglobin expression. Results: The hemoglobin E mutation of HbE/β-thalassemia iPSCs was seamlessly corrected by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The corrected clones were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor cells under feeder-free and OP9 coculture systems. These progenitor cells were further expanded in erythroid liquid culture system and developed into erythroid cells that expressed mature HBB gene and HBB protein. Conclusions: Our study provides a strategy to correct hemoglobin E mutation in one step and these corrected iPSCs can be differentiated into hematopoietic stem cells to be used for autologous transplantation in patients with HbE/β-thalassemia in the future."
"QCM-based rapid detection of PCR amplification products of Ehrlichia canis  2017 Elsevier B.V.Ehrlichia canis is an intracellular parasitic bacterium and arthropod-borne pathogen that receives growing attention, because it leads to increasing morbidity and mortality in animals. It does so by causing canine monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (CME). Infected canines may lack obvious clinical signs and stay in chronic stage. Herein we report a rapid screening method based on PCR assay combined with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to design a DNA sensor for detecting E. canis in early stages of infection. The test relies on DNA amplification of target nucleotide sequences via PCR followed by detecting DNA-DNA hybridization using QCM. The approach did not result in any cross-hybridization toward other blood bacteria or parasites in dogs, such as Anaplasma platys, Babesia canis and Trypanosoma spp, but turned out selective for the target species. The limit of detection of QCM was as low as 4.1 × 109 molecules/μl of 289 bp E. canis PCR products corresponding to 22 copy numbers/μl of E. canis. Furthermore, the technique is also simple, does not require complicated equipment and can in principle be reused."
Influences of solvent media on chain organization and thermochromic behaviors of polydiacetylene assemblies prepared from monomer with symmetric alkyl tails  2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering ChemistryThis contribution investigates thermochromic behaviors and morphologies of polydiacetylene(PDA) assemblies prepared from a diacetylene monomer constituting symmetric alkyl tails. Properties of solvent media strongly affects molecular organization during the preparation process. The use of water provides PDA assemblies with irregular shape while a sheet-like structure forms in butanol. Thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction detect the variation of crystalline fraction and interlamellar spacing in these structures. The change of solvent media significantly affects their thermochromic behaviors. Thin film of PDA assemblies prepared in butanol exhibits reversible thermochromism with much higher color-transition temperature compared to the system of water.
"Synthesis and structure-property relationship of lipoic acid-containing porphyrin derivatives for mitochondria-targeting applications  2017 Elsevier B.V.In this research, synthesis and characterization of a novel unsymmetric water-soluble porphyrin having three N-methylpyridinium and one lipoic acid-based meso-substituents were described. Effects of incorporation between a lipoic acid unit and a pyridinium-substituted porphyrin macrocycle, and the presence of Mn(II) as a metal center of the porphyrin ring on cytotoxicity of the compounds in Human keratinocyte (HaCaT) and Human dermal fibroblast, adult (HDFa) cells, and on mitochondria-targeting activity in the HaCaT cells were investigated. The biological studies revealed that the target lipoic acid-containing Mn(II)-porphyrin had low cytotoxicity with IC50 values bigger than 115 µM and of 87 µM in the HaCaT and HDFa cells, respectively. Moreover, this target compound also exhibited satisfactory mitochondria-targeting activity in the HaCaT cells."
"The association of sociodemographic characteristics and sexual risk behaviors with health literacy toward behaviors for preventing unintended pregnancy among university students  2018 Thongnopakun et al.Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an associated effect between sociodemographic characteristics and sexual risk behaviors with health literacy in preventing unintended pregnancy among university students in Chon Buri province, Thailand. Participants and methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. The data were collected between February and May, 2017. A self-administered questionnaire was developed by the Ministry of Public Health and supported by the evolving concept of health literacy of Nutbeam. This questionnaire was then applied to collect data from 418 university students. Descriptive statistical and binary logistic regression methods were used for data analysis in this study. Results: Half the students exhibited inappropriate behaviors to prevent unintended pregnancies. However, half the respondents had been educated to prevent unintended pregnancies. Nearly onethird of the students had experienced sexual intercourse. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze an association between the behavior for unintended-pregnancy prevention with sociodemographic characteristics and the health literacy of university students. The factors assessed were current residence type (the adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.897, 95% CI=1.123-3.205), previous sexual intercourse (aOR=3.263, 95% CI=1.735-6.139), cognitive health to prevent unintended pregnancy (aOR=1.095, 95% CI=1.019-1.176), decision skills in choosing appropriate practices to prevent unintended pregnancy (aOR=1.289, 95% CI=1.182-1.405), and self-management to prevent unintended pregnancy (aOR=1.113, 95% CI=1.005-1.232). Conclusion: This study indicated that university students who had experienced sexual intercourse and had low health literacy were more likely to exhibit inappropriate behaviors concerning the lack of prevention of unintended pregnancies. The results will provide health professionals with information to develop more effective prevention and intervention programs."
"Appearance and potential predictors of poorly controlled hypertension at the primary care level in an urban community  2018 Visanuyothin et al.Purpose: Hypertension (HT) is the major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases because of its poor control. To control HT at the primary care level in urban communities, there is a demand for deeper comprehension of the manifestations of poorly controlled HT. This study aimed to examine appearance of HT, including the association between the appearance and home blood pressure (HBP) control at the primary care level in urban communities. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in July-October 2017 in an urban community in Thailand. The total sample size from randomization was 125 poorly controlled HT patients who were diagnosed with an average clinic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg in their last three visits. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews, HBP monitoring (HBPM), and blood and urine testing. Data analysis was conducted via descriptive statistics and the chisquare tests, with a significance level of p<0.05. Results: HBPM revealed that 58.4% of patients with poorly controlled blood pressure from clinic measurement had a systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure that were below the HBP target. Most patients were overweight/obese, but they were nonsmokers and nondrinkers. As comorbidities, they had hyperlipidemia (64.0%) and diabetes mellitus (53.0%). One-quarter of them had good levels of knowledge and literacy. Nearly half had good health self-care literacy. Only 13% exhibited adequate self-management behaviors, but more than half had biochemistry results within normal limits. There were significant associations of smoking history and having hyperlipidemia as a comorbidity with HBP control (p =0.010 and 0.046, respectively). Conclusion: The role of HBPM is important in practice when it comes to monitoring HT control at the primary care level in an urban context. Smoking cessation and control of the blood lipid levels should be highlighted not only at the practice, but also at the policy level."
"Observation of Electroweak Production of Same-Sign W Boson Pairs in the Two Jet and Two Same-Sign Lepton Final State in Proton-Proton Collisions at s =13 TeV  2018 CERN.The first observation of electroweak production of same-sign W boson pairs in proton-proton collisions is reported. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1 collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Events are selected by requiring exactly two leptons (electrons or muons) of the same charge, moderate missing transverse momentum, and two jets with a large rapidity separation and a large dijet mass. The observed significance of the signal is 5.5 standard deviations, where a significance of 5.7 standard deviations is expected based on the standard model. The ratio of measured event yields to that expected from the standard model at leading order is 0.90±0.22. A cross section measurement in a fiducial region is reported. Bounds are given on the structure of quartic vector boson interactions in the framework of dimension-8 effective field theory operators and on the production of doubly charged Higgs bosons."
"The H2-treated TiO2 supported Pt catalysts prepared by strong electrostatic adsorption for liquid-phase selective hydrogenation  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The H2-treated TiO2 supported Pt catalysts were prepared by strong electrostatic adsorption method and tested in the liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of various organic compounds such as 3-nitrostyrene to vinylaniline (VA) and furfural to furfuryl alcohol (FA). A combination of high Pt dispersion, strong interaction of Pt-TiOx, and the presence of low coordination Pt sites was necessary for high hydrogenation activity. However, while the selectivity of VA in 3-nitrostyrene hydrogenation did not depend much on the catalyst preparation method used, the selectivity of FA in furfural hydrogenation was much higher when the catalysts were prepared by SEA, comparing to those obtained by impregnation in which the solvent product was formed, due probably to the non-acidic conditions used during Pt loading by SEA method."
"Longitudinal study of age-specific pattern of coronavirus infection in Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Thailand  2018 The Author(s).Background: Bats are natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic and novel viruses including coronaviruses (CoVs) (mainly Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus). Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei)'s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak. Methods: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during January-December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length ≤ 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4). Conclusions: The fact that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period. Whether viral reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored."
"Development of stereotactic radiosurgery using carbon beams (carbon-knife)  2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.The aim of this research is to develop a stereotactic-radiosurgery (SRS) technique using carbon beams to treat small intracranial lesions; we call this device the carbon knife. A 2D-scanning method is adapted to broaden a pencil beam to an appropriate size for an irradiation field. A Mitsubishi slow extraction using third order resonance through a rf acceleration system stabilized by a feed-forward scanning beam using steering magnets with a 290 MeV/u initial beam energy was used for this purpose. Ridge filters for spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) with widths of 5 mm, 7.5 mm, and 10 mm were designed to include fluence-attenuation effects. The collimator, which defines field shape, was used to reduce the lateral penumbra. The lateral-penumbra width at the SOBP region was less than 2 mm for the carbon knife. The penumbras behaved almost the same when changing the air gap, but on the other hand, increasing the range-shifter thickness mostly broadened the lateral penumbra. The physical-dose rates were approximate 6 Gy s-1 and 4.5 Gy s-1 for the 10 × 10 mm2 and 5 × 5 mm2 collimators, respectively."
"Agreement of self- and physician-collected samples for detection of high-risk human papillomavirus infections in women attending a colposcopy clinic in Thailand  2018 The Author(s).Objective: To study the concordance between vaginal self- and endocervical physician-collected high-risk (hr) HPV testing in Thai women who attended a colposcopy clinic. Vaginal samples were obtained by self-sampling with a dry brush before endocervical samples were obtained by physicians. Both specimens were analyzed for hrHPV by Cobas4800 HPV test. Results: Of the 247 pairs of samples, overall hrHPV prevalence from self- and physician-collected samples was 41.3 and 36.0%, respectively. The overall agreement between the methods was 74.5% with κ 0.46 (P < 0.001). Our study revealed moderate agreement between self- and physician-collected methods for hrHPV testing."
"Silicone gel enhances the efficacy of Er:YAG laser treatment for atrophic acne scars: A randomized, split-face, evaluator-blinded, placebo-controlled, comparative trial  2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Background: The effect of topical silicone gel has been studied to prevent scars from burn, postoperative wound and to treat hypertrophic scars. No previous studies have been done to evaluate the efficacy of topical silicone gel on atrophic acne scars. Material and methods: Nineteen patients were treated with three sessions of ablative Er:YAG laser with 1-month intervals. Following each laser treatment, the randomlyassigned silicone gel or placebo was applied in split-face manner. Objective assessments, which included roughness, smoothness, hydration, transepidermal water loss were measured at baseline and prior to each treatment. Subjective assessments by dermatologists and subjects were done at baseline and 1 month after last laser treatment. Results: The laser treatments were well tolerated and resulted in clinical improvements. Topical silicone gel treatment resulted in significantly less roughness at weeks 4 and 12 compared with placebo (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Adding topical silicone gel to ablative Er:YAG laser treatment may provide additional benefits in improving acne scars."
"Half-normal approximation for statistics of symmetric simple random walk  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.In 2013, Döbler used Stein’s method to obtain the uniform bounds in half-normal approximation for three statistics of a symmetric simple random walk; the maximum value, the number of returns to the origin and the number of sign changes up to a given time n. In this paper, we give the non-uniform bounds for these statistics by using Stein’s method and the concentration inequality approach."
"Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson's disease patients: Prevalence, associated factors and its impact on balance confidence  2017 Elsevier B.V.Background Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a commonly reported sign of the cardiovascular autonomic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients might suffer from a variety of the clinical symptoms of OH, including dizziness, lightheadedness, or problems with vision and fatigue. Objectives To determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and to identify any relationships between the clinical symptoms of OH and balance confidence in this patient population. Methods Symptomatic OH was defined as a systolic or diastolic BP fall of ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 mmHg respectively, within 3 min of standing and an Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) score of more than zero. Factors related to symptomatic OH were identified from a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Pearson's correlation test was used to reveal any relationships between the clinical symptoms of OH and a patient's confidence in their ability to balance, assessed using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. Results 100 Thai PD patients were consecutively recruited into this study. The prevalence of symptomatic OH was 18%, asymptomatic OH was 4%, while 78% were patients without OH. Factors associated with symptomatic OH were age (OR, 95%CI: 1.06, 1.003–1.115, p = 0.038) and hypertension (OR, 95%CI: 6.16, 1.171–32.440, p = 0.032). A significant and negative correlation (r = − 0.229, p = 0.022) between OHQ composite scores and item 3 of the ABC scale (picking up slippers from floor), one of the movements in a vertical orientation, was found. Conclusion Elderly PD patients and with a co-morbidity of essential hypertension should be closely evaluated for the presence of symptomatic OH. In addition, they should be advised to change positions slowly, especially those in a vertical orientation."

"Efficiency of the formulated plant-growth promoting Pseudomonas fluorescens MC46 inoculant on triclocarban treatment in soil and its effect on Vigna radiata growth and soil enzyme activities  2017 Elsevier B.V.For bioaugmentation-based treatment of triclocarban (TCC), an emerging soil pollutant that is recalcitrant to biodegradation and phytotransformation, efficient TCC-degrading bacteria with an effective soil-delivering means are required. This work developed the formulated bacterial inoculant, and successfully demonstrated its TCC removal and detoxification performance in pot soil experiment with Vigna radiata plants. The soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens MC46 was isolated as TCC-degrading, plant-growth promoting bacterium. The characterizations were conducted in vitro revealing that it could utilize TCC as a sole carbon source, and at a wide and higher concentration range from 1.6–31.6 mg kg−1 than those previously reported, while the detoxification was assessed by cytogenotoxicity and phytotoxicity tests. The developed sawdust-based inoculant formula combined with molasses (5% w/w), and either PEG or CMC-starch blend (1% w/w) could maintain a 20-week shelf-life inoculant stability in terms of cell viability, and TCC-degrading activity. Bioaugmentation of the formulated inoculants into TCC-contaminated soil efficiently removed TCC up to 74–76% of the initial concentration, mitigated toxicity, restored plant growth and health, and enhanced soil enzyme activities. This work is the first to demonstrate potential application of the formulated plant-growth promoting bacterial inoculant for the treatment and detoxification of a persistent TCC contaminated in soil."
"Low temperature preparation of oxygen-deficient tin dioxide nanocrystals and a role of oxygen vacancy in photocatalytic activity improvement  2017 Elsevier Inc.The introduction of oxygen vacancies (Vos) into tin dioxide crystal structure has been found as an effective method to improve its photocatalytic performance. Herein, oxygen-deficient tin dioxide (SnO2−x) nanocrystals were successfully prepared via a facile, one-step hydrothermal method at the temperature lower than those reported previously. The effect of hydrothermal temperature on phase composition and Vos content was also firstly investigated. Due to its high oxygen vacancy concentration, the SnO2−x prepared at 80 °C provides the best photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under UV–visible light. Scavenger trapping and nitroblue tetrazolium experiments also show that the Vos act as electron trapped sites and molecular oxygen adsorption sites, therefore increasing the production of active [rad]O2− radical which is the main species governing the photocatalytic activity of SnO2−x nanocrystals. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence measurement and electron spin resonance investigation clearly indicate that increasing the hydrothermal temperature results in the coexistence of SnO2−x and Sn3O4 phases and the reduction of Vos concentration which are detrimental to the photocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations also reveal that the presence of Vos is responsible for the upshift of valence band maximum and an extended conduction band minimum, hence a valence band width broadening and band gap narrowing which consequently enhance the photocatalytic performance of the oxygen-deficient SnO2−x."
"Syntheses and photophysical properties of diaminotetraphenylporphyrins and their corresponding polyimides  2017 Elsevier B.V.Two free base porphyrins, 5,10-bis(4-aminophenyl)-15,20-diphenylporphyrin (cis-DATPP), 5,15-bis(4-aminophenyl)-10,20-diphenylporphyrin (trans-DATPP), and their zinc metalated analogues (cis-ZnDATPP and trans-ZnDATPP) were synthesized. A series of their corresponding polyimides were obtained by the condensed polymerization of the respective monomeric isomer DATPP with a 1:1 ratio of 2,2′-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,4′-diaminobiphenyl (PFMB) and 4,4′-hexafluoroisopropylidenediphthalic anhydride (6FDA). The inclusion of PFMB and 6FDA into the polymeric backbone causes the polymers to be moderately to highly soluble in organic polar solvents. The molar content of the respective DATPP monomer varied between 5 and 30%. All compounds were structurally characterized by 1H NMR and ATR-IR spectroscopy and the porphyrin content in the polyimides was determined by UV–Visible absorption spectroscopy. Photophysical properties consisted of measuring both the UV–Visible (ground state) absorption and fluorescence (excited state) spectra, fluorescence quantum yields (Φf), and fluorescence lifetimes (τf) in dichloromethane and N,N-dimethylacetamide. Fluorescence quenching was also measured and observed by the Stern-Volmer relationship, using 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ) as the quencher molecule. Both the bimolecular rate constant of fluorescence quenching (kq) and the Stern-Volmer constant (KQ) were calculated from this relationship. Furthermore, deviations from linearity depicted in the Stern-Volmer plots for TPP and ZnTPP at higher concentrations of AQ were also measured as a means of examining and explaining the simultaneous occurrence of dynamic (collisional) quenching and static quenching in the mechanisms of fluorescence quenching. It was found in this work that the significantly larger values in the static quenching constant (KS) than in the dynamic quenching constant (KD) are indicative that static quenching and ground state complex formation between the fluorophore and quencher is the dominant mechanism of fluorescence quenching of these systems at higher quencher concentrations."
"Exploring Home and Work Locations in a City from Mobile Phone Data  2017 IEEE.Recently, mobile phone call detail records (CDR) have been used to study mobility patterns in cities. Since home and workplace are the most important places in people's lives and define the structure and activity patterns of the city, identifying home and work locations and home-work commuting patterns are of much interest. However, due to decreasing usage of voice calls and SMS, and low usage while people staying at home, identifying home and work locations are getting more difficult. In this paper, we develop a method to exploit daily-aggregated internet usage data (G-CDR) in addition to CDR for identifying work locations. We also develop a method for identifying home locations based on detecting sleeping time. This method can significantly increase home detection success rate and accuracy. From the identified home and work locations, we have explored the population distribution and commuting patterns of people in Bangkok."
"Inclusive Search for a Highly Boosted Higgs Boson Decaying to a Bottom Quark-Antiquark Pair  2018 CERN.An inclusive search for the standard model Higgs boson (H) produced with large transverse momentum (pT) and decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair (bb) is performed using a data set of pp collisions at s=13 TeV collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. A highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs boson decaying to bb is reconstructed as a single, large radius jet, and it is identified using jet substructure and dedicated b tagging techniques. The method is validated with Z→bb decays. The Z→bb process is observed for the first time in the single-jet topology with a local significance of 5.1 standard deviations (5.8 expected). For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events above the expected background is observed (expected) with a local significance of 1.5 (0.7) standard deviations. The measured cross section times branching fraction for production via gluon fusion of H→bb with reconstructed pT>450 GeV and in the pseudorapidity range -2.5<η<2.5 is 74±48(stat)-10+17(syst) fb, which is consistent within uncertainties with the standard model prediction."
"High prevalence of hepatitis B-antibody loss and a case report of de novo hepatitis B virus infection in a child after living-donor liver transplantation  The Author(s) 2018. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.To assess the seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunity among previously vaccinated pediatric liver transplant recipients and present a case report of de novo hepatitis B infection after liver transplantation. METHODS This study focused on children with chronic liver diseases who received primary hepatitis B immunization and had a complete dataset of anti-HBs before and after liver transplantation between May 2001 and June 2017. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for potential factors relating to HBV immunity loss. RESULTS In total, 50 children were recruited. The mean time from liver transplantation to anti-HBs testing was 2.53 ± 2.11 years. The mean anti-HBs levels before and after liver transplantation were 584.41 ± 415.45 and 58.56 ± 6.40 IU/L, respectively. The rate of nonimmunity (anti-HBs < 10 IU/L) in the participants was 46% (n = 26) at one year, 57% (n = 7) at two years and 82% (n = 17) at > three years following liver transplantation. The potential factors relating to HBV immunity loss after liver transplantation were identified as anti-HBs (P = 0.002), serum albumin (P = 0.04), total bilirubin (P = 0.001) and direct bilirubin (P = 0.003) before liver transplantation. A five-year-old boy with biliary cirrhosis received 4 doses of HBV vaccine with an anti-HBs titer of > 1000 IU/L and underwent liver transplantation; his anti-HBc-negative father was the donor. After liver transplantation, the boy had stenosis of the hepatic artery up to the inferior vena cava anastomosis and underwent venoplasty three times. He also received subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin for 5 mo and 20 transfusions of blood components. Three years and ten months after the liver transplantation, transaminitis was detected with positive tests for HBsAg, HBeAg, and anti-HBc (2169.61, 1706 and 8.45, respectively; cutoff value: < 1.00) and an HBV viral load of 33212320 IU/mL. CONCLUSION The present study showed that loss of hepatitis B immunity after liver transplantation is unexpectedly common. In our case report, despite high levels of anti- HBs prior to transplantation, infection occurred at a time when, unfortunately, the child had lost immunity to hepatitis B after liver transplantation."
"Targeted orexin and hypothalamic neuropeptides for migraine  The Author(s) 2018.The hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of homeostatic mechanisms and migraine-related trigeminal nociception and as such has been hypothesized to play a central role in the migraine syndrome from the earliest stages of the attack. The hypothalamus hosts many key neuropeptide systems that have been postulated to play a role in this pathophysiology. Such neuropeptides include but are not exclusive too orexins, oxytocin, neuropeptide Y, and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein, which will be the focus of this review. Each of these peptides has its own unique physiological role and as such many preclinical studies have been conducted targeting these peptide systems with evidence supporting their role in migraine pathophysiology. Preclinical studies have also begun to explore potential therapeutic compounds targeting these systems with some success in all cases. Clinical efficacy of dual orexin receptor antagonists and intranasal oxytocin have been tested; however, both have yet to demonstrate clinical effect. Despite this, there were limitations in these cases and strong arguments can be made for the further development of intranasal oxytocin for migraine prophylaxis. Regarding neuropeptide Y, work has yet to begun in a clinical setting, and clinical trials for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein are just beginning to be established with much optimism. Regardless, it is becoming increasingly clear the prominent role that the hypothalamus and its peptide systems have in migraine pathophysiology. Much work is required to better understand this system and the early stages of the attack to develop more targeted and effective therapies aimed at reducing attack susceptibility with the potential to prevent the attack all together."
"Seroprevalence of small ruminant caprine arthritis encephalitis lentivirus among goats from selected small ruminant farms in Selangor, Malaysia  Jesse, et al.Background and Aim: Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) is an important viral disease of small ruminants particularly in dairy goats with severe social and economic implication. Hence, this study was designed to determine the seroprevalence of CAE virus (CAEV) among goat population in selected small ruminant farms in Selangor and the risk factors associated with the occurrence of the disease. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from a total of 91 goats selected at random. Blood serum was harvested and used for competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test to detect antibodies against CAE virus. Results: The result obtained showed that 8/91 (8.8%) of the goats were seropositive for CAEV. In addition, biosecurity management, source of origin and sex of the animal were observed to be important risk factors associated with the occurrence of CAE in goats. Conclusion: The findings of this study affirmed that the seroprevalence of CAEV infection among goat population in small ruminant farms in Selangor, Malaysia, is low. However, there is need to institute strict control measures such as testing and culling positive animals or separation of infected animals from those that tested negative to the disease for effective eradication of the disease."
"Cospatial Star Formation and Supermassive Black Hole Growth in z ∼ 3 Galaxies: Evidence for in Situ Co-evolution  2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We present a sub-kiloparsec localization of the sites of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in three active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z ∼ 3 in relation to the regions of intense star formation in their hosts. These AGNs are selected from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field and COSMOS, with the centimetric radio emission tracing both star formation and AGN, and the sub/millimeter emission by dust tracing nearly pure star formation. We require radio emission to be ≥5× more luminous than the level associated with the sub/millimeter star formation to ensure that the radio emission is AGN-dominated, thereby allowing localization of the AGN and star formation independently. In all three galaxies, the AGNs are located within the compact regions of gas-rich, heavily obscured, intense nuclear star formation, with R e = 0.4-1.1 kpc and average star formation rates of ≃100-1200 M o yr-1. If the current episode of star formation continues at such a rate over the stellar mass doubling time of their hosts, ≃0.2 Gyr, the newly formed stellar mass will be of the order of 1011 M o within the central kiloparsec region, concurrently and cospatially with significant growth of the SMBH. This is consistent with a picture of in situ galactic bulge and SMBH formation. This work demonstrates the unique complementarity of VLA and ALMA observations to unambiguously pinpoint the locations of AGNs and star formation down to ≃30 mas, corresponding to ≃230 pc at z = 3."
"Search for heavy resonances decaying to a top quark and a bottom quark in the lepton+jets final state in proton–proton collisions at 13 TeV  2017 The AuthorA search is presented for narrow heavy resonances decaying to a top quark and a bottom quark using data collected by the CMS experiment at s=13TeV in 2016. The data set analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1. Final states that include a single lepton (e, μ), multiple jets, and missing transverse momentum are analyzed. No evidence is found for the production of a W′ boson, and the production of right-handed W′ bosons is excluded at 95% confidence level for masses up to 3.6TeV depending on the scenario considered. Exclusion limits for W′ bosons are also presented as a function of their coupling strength to left- and right-handed fermions. These limits on a W′ boson decaying via a top and a bottom quark are the most stringent published to date."
"Administration of co-expressed Penaeus stylirostris densovirus-like particles and dsRNA-YHV-Pro provide protection against yellow head virus in shrimp  2018 Elsevier B.V.The activation of the innate RNA interference pathway through double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) is one of the approaches to protecting shrimp from viruses. Previous studies have shown that injection of specific dsRNAs can successfully inhibit viral infection in shrimp. However, inhibition requires high levels of dsRNA and dsRNA stability in shrimp is limited. Virus-like particles (VLPs) have been applied to deliver nucleic acids into host cells because of the protection of dsRNAs from host endonucleases as well as the target specificity provided by VLPs. Therefore, this study aimed to develop Penaeus stylirostris densovirus (PstDNV) VLPs for dsRNA deliver to shrimp. The PstDNV capsid protein was expressed and can be self-assembled to form PstDNV VLPs. Co-expression of dsRNA-YHV-Pro and PstDNV capsid protein was achieved in the same bacterial cells, whose structure was displayed as the aggregation of VLPs by TEM. Tested for their inhibiting yellow head virus (YHV) from infecting shrimp, the dsRNA-YHV-Pro-PstDNV VLPs gave higher levels of YHV suppression and a greater reduction in shrimp mortality than the delivery of naked dsRNA-YHV-Pro. Therefore, PstDNV-VLPs are a promising vehicle for dsRNA delivery that maintains the anti-virus activity of dsRNA in shrimp over a longer period of time as compared to native dsRNAs."
"Agent scheduling of call center using decomposition technique  2017 IEEE.This research studies an agent scheduling of a call center where the number of agents and skills are predetermined and varied during each period. Agents must be assigned into work shifts in order to minimize labor related cost and also satisfy working constraints such as worker availability, work duration and break requirements. We decompose this problem into two parts which are solved sequentially. First is to determine the minimum number of required agents for each shift across a month that covers the predetermined number of agents in each period. The outcomes from the first part are used as input for the second part which is to assign agents into work shifts. Mixed integer programming models are proposed to find solutions for both parts."
"A mathematical model for double layer precast production scheduling  2017 IEEE.This paper involves a precast production with double layer in identical parallel molds. The precast production consists of 5 processes to be produced sequentially. Each process requires a specific resource that must be shared among molds except the curing process which does not require any resources. There are 5 concrete formulas for considering that do not effect on the precast quality. Nevertheless, each formula results in different costs and different processing time. The more expensive formula requires the shorter processing time. We propose an MIP model to select formulas and schedule all jobs to finish within due date."
"Optimal hydrogen production coupled with pollutant removal from biodiesel wastewater using a thermally treated TiO2 photocatalyst (P25): Influence of the operating conditions  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This work aimed to produce hydrogen (H2) simultaneously with pollutant removal from biodiesel wastewater by photocatalytic oxidation using a thermally-treated commercial titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalyst at room temperature (~30◦C) and ambient pressure. The effects of the operating conditions, including the catalyst loading level (1–6 g/L), UV light intensity (3.52–6.64 mW/cm2), initial pH of the wastewater (2.3–8.0) and reaction time (1–4 h), on the quantity of H2 production together with the reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and oil and grease levels were explored. It was found that all the investigated parameters affected the level of H2 production and pollutant removal. The optimum operating condition for simultaneous H2 production and pollutant removal was found at an initial wastewater pH of 6.0, a catalyst dosage of 4.0 g/L, a UV light intensity of 4.79 mW/cm2 and a reaction time of 2 h. These conditions led to the production of 228 µmol H2 with a light conversion efficiency of 6.78% and reduced the COD, BOD and oil and grease levels by 13.2%, 89.6% and 67.7%, respectively. The rate of pollutant removal followed a pseudo-first order chemical reaction with a rate constant of 0.008, 0.085 and 0.044 min−1 for the COD, BOD and oil and grease removal, respectively."
"Second dimension column ensemble pressure tuning in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography  2017 Elsevier B.V.A pressure tunable (PT) coupled column ensemble has been implemented for the second dimension (2D) separation in comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography (GC×PTGC). This process requires two columns to be connected by a pressure junction, as a replacement for a single narrow bore, short column in 2D. Various 2D1 and 2D2 columns may be selected to provide complementary selectivity (polarity) compared to the 1D column. The tunable residence time arising from differential pressure drop in each 2D column results in a tunable fractional contribution of each column in the 2D separation. A sample mixture comprising different chemical classes, including alkanes and alcohols, is used to identify the feasibility and extent of selectivity tuning possible in GC×PTGC. The column length is also varied due to the imposed challenge of wraparound in the PT coupled column system as pressures are adjusted in the 2D separation. Different experimental parameters, stationary phase materials and column lengths have been applied to investigate and understand the separation behaviour of the 2D PT coupled column GC×GC system. Results are discussed considering analyte retention time, peak width, linear velocity and the contribution of each 2D column. A specific and unexpected example of GC×GC separation was demonstrated where the peak positions of polar and apolar compounds could almost swap their 2D retention position by application of PT. Kerosene was analysed as an example of complex sample analysis by GC×PTGC system. This process is shown to be a practical approach for altering different stationary phase selectivities in a single 2D arrangement in GC×GC."
"A biological-like memory allocation scheme using simulation  2017 IEEE.This research proposes a novel memory allocation scheme to efficiently handle memory management. The scheme employs biological behavioral principles of the life forms. At the principal construct lives the cells having limited resources, yet passively operates with little overhead. The proposed scheme imitates this unicellular characterization to execute one task at a time using First-In-First-Out queue. Execution is regulated by a global clock that permits one active task at any given time in memory. Consequently, low overhead memory allocation can be achieved without the need for elaborate scheduling and other supporting algorithms. The most anticipatory benefit is simplicity that permits straightforward technological transfer of the proposed scheme to hardware. The contributions are to systematically mitigate the memory wall and reduce power consumed by memory management activities."
"Improved design of a cone-shaped rotating disk for shear force loading in a cell culture plate  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In our previous study, a cone-shaped rotating disk had been designed and proposed for generating shear force on the cell in a cell culture plate. This study aims to improve the design of the rotating disk that could provide a better uniformity of shear stress distribution. The top of the cone was designed to be trimmed off to obtain a flat head area. The effect of tilt angle (θ) was numerically studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique in ANSYS-Fluent software. The results revealed that for 500 rpm, the new designed rotating disk with a height of cone-shaped top to the plate bottom h = 1 mm and θ = 25° provided the best uniformity of 0.820 which was better than that of the previously designed."
"Effect of Metal-Acid Balance on Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet Fuel Synthesis from Hydrocracking and Hydroisomerization of Biohydrogenated Diesel over Pt-Supported Catalysts  2018 American Chemical Society.The development of Pt-supported catalysts for a selective hydrocracking and hydroisomerization of biohydrogenated diesel (BHD, n-C15-C18) to hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel (C9-C14) was investigated. The different acidic supports (i.e., HY zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 5.5 and 100 and amorphous silica-alumina supports) loaded with 0.5 wt % Pt content were prepared and tested for the catalytic conversion of BHD to HRJ fuel. The Pt supported on HY zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 100 denoted as Pt/HY(100) catalyst exhibited the highest jet fuel yield with high branched isomers due to its good balance between metal and acid function. The effects of the reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on the hydrocracking and hydroisomerization performance were studied over Pt/HY(100) catalyst. The jet fuel yield was obtained at maximum value of 33 wt % at 310 °C, 450 psig, LHSV of 1.0 h-1, and H2/BHD molar ratio of 30. A stability test was also conducted over Pt/HY(100) catalyst for 160 h. No significant change in the catalytic activity and selectivity during the test was observed, indicating the high stability of the Pt/HY(100) catalyst."
"Normal probability plots with confidence for the residuals in linear regression  2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Normal probability plots for a simple random sample and normal probability plots for residuals from linear regression are not treated differently in statistical text books. In the statistical literature, 1 − α simultaneous probability intervals for augmenting a normal probability plot for a simple random sample are available. The first purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the tests associated with the 1 − α simultaneous probability intervals for a simple random sample may have a size substantially different from α when applied to the residuals from linear regression. This leads to the second purpose of this article: construction of four normal probability plot-based tests for residuals, which have size α exactly. We then compare the powers of these four graphical tests and a non-graphical test for residuals in order to assess the power performances of the graphical tests and to identify the ones that have better power. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the methods."
"Optimized human detection on the embedded computer vision system  2017 IEEE.This paper presents a real-time human detection technique that is capable of real time processing images in Raspberry Pi.

"Electrochemical immunoassay using open circuit potential detection labeled by platinum nanoparticles  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In this work, a simple electrochemical immunoassay based on platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) using open circuit potential (OCP) detection was developed. The detection of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) as a model analyte, was demonstrated by direct electrical detection of PtNPs in hydrazine solution using OCP measurement without any application of either potential or current to the system. Disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) were utilized for the development of our immunosensor, which required a sample volume as small as 2 µL. After preparation of a sandwich-type immunosystem, hydrazine solution was dropped on the electrode’s surface, which was followed immediately by electrical detection using OCP. The change of the OCP signal originated from electrocatalytic oxidation of the hydrazine on PtNPs. Under the optimal conditions of a pH of 6.0 and a hydrazine concentration of 1 mM, a detection limit of 0.28 ng mL−1 and a linearity of 0–10 ng mL−1 were obtained. The PtNP-based OCP method is a simpler electrochemical detection procedure than those obtained from other electrochemical methods and has an acceptable sensitivity and reproducibility. The simplicity of the detection procedure and the cost-effectiveness of the disposable SPCE illustrate the attractive benefits of this sensor. Moreover, it could be applied to a simplified and miniaturized diagnostic system with minimal user manipulation."
"In vitro neutralization of yellow head virus infection in shrimp using recombinant PmYRP65 protein  2018 Elsevier B.V.Yellow head virus (YHV) is a major pathogen in the Southeast Asia shrimp aquaculture industry especially in Thailand, and YHV associated mortality results in significant economic loss. Although appropriate farm management strategies can decrease the YHV infection rate in shrimp, an epidemic of the virus remains, with no specific anti-YHV therapy. Previous reports have identified PmYRP65 as a protein that mediates YHV entry into susceptible cells, and studies using RNA interference have shown that systemic administration of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) directed to PmYRP65 are able to provide protection against infection. This study sought to determine whether recombinant PmYRP65 protein (rPmYRP65) would be able to act as a competitive binding protein to neutralize YHV infection. To undertake this a cDNA encoding PmYRP65 was cloned, and rPmYRP65 was expressed, purified and characterized for its ability to neutralize YHV infection before injection into shrimp. The results showed that rPmYRP65 protein could significantly inhibit YHV infection by its receptor characteristic, through acting as a competitor to bind YHV. This study showed that rPmYRP65 has potential applications for neutralizing YHV infection of shrimp."
"A neuro-immune, neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative model of prenatal and postpartum depression  2017 Elsevier Inc.A large body of evidence indicates that major affective disorders are accompanied by activated neuro-immune, neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways. Postpartum depression is predicted by end of term prenatal depressive symptoms whilst a lifetime history of mood disorders appears to increase the risk for both prenatal and postpartum depression. This review provides a critical appraisal of available evidence linking IO&NS pathways to prenatal and postpartum depression. The electronic databases Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus were sources for this narrative review focusing on keywords, including perinatal depression, (auto)immune, inflammation, oxidative, nitric oxide, nitrosative, tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), kynurenine, leaky gut and microbiome. Prenatal depressive symptoms are associated with exaggerated pregnancy-specific changes in IO&NS pathways, including increased C-reactive protein, advanced oxidation protein products and nitric oxide metabolites, lowered antioxidant levels, such as zinc, as well as lowered regulatory IgM-mediated autoimmune responses. The latter pathways coupled with lowered levels of endogenous anti-inflammatory compounds, including ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, may also underpin the pathophysiology of postpartum depression. Although increased bacterial translocation, lipid peroxidation and TRYCAT pathway activation play a role in mood disorders, similar changes do not appear to be relevant in perinatal depression. Some IO&NS biomarker characteristics of mood disorders are found in prenatal depression indicating that these pathways partly contribute to the association of a lifetime history of mood disorders and perinatal depression. However, available evidence suggests that some IO&NS pathways differ significantly between perinatal depression and mood disorders in general.

"Are there differences in lipid peroxidation and immune biomarkers between major depression and bipolar disorder: Effects of melancholia, atypical depression, severity of illness, episode number, suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempts  2017 Elsevier Inc.Background There is evidence that major depression (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are accompanied by activated immune & oxidative (I&O) pathways. Methods To compare I&O biomarkers between MDD and BD we assessed serum levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS; a lipid peroxidation marker), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), sIL-6R, IL-α, sIL-1R antagonist (sIL-1RA), tumor necrosis factor receptor 60 kDa/80 kDa (sTNFR60/R80) in 114 MDD and 133 BD patients, and 50 healthy controls. We computed z-unit weighted indices reflecting the 5 cytokine receptor levels (zCytR), cell-mediated immunity (zCMI) and I&O pathways (zCMI + TBARS). Results There are no significant differences in biomarkers between MDD and BD. BD/MDD with atypical features is characterized by increased sIL-6R and TBARS, whereas melancholia is associated with higher TBARS and lower sTNFR60 levels. Severity of illness, as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, is correlated with increased sIL-6R, sTNFR80, TBARS, zCytR and zCMI + TBARS. The number of episodes the year prior to blood sampling is positively associated with sTNFR80, TBARS, zCMI, zCMI + TBARS, while number of hospitalizations is positively associated with sIL-1RA. Prior suicidal attempts are associated with increased sIL-1RA, IL-1α, zCMI, TBARS and zCMI + TBARS, while TBARS is associated with current suicidal ideation. Conclusions There are no I&O biomarker differences between MDD and BD. Atypical depression is associated with increased IL-6 trans-signaling and lipid peroxidation. Severity of depression, number of episodes and suicidal attempts are associated with activated I&O pathways. Increased TBARS is the single best predictor of BD/MDD, atypical depression, melancholia and current suicidal ideation."
"Statin use and histopathological change in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis  2018 Sciendo. All Rights Reserved.Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease. The primary treatment of NAFLD by statins has not been clearly elucidated. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of statin use in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis on the change in liver histology. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for clinical trials and observational studies investigating the effects of statins on histological change regardless of type or dosage from inception to December 2015. Random-effect model meta-analyses were used to compute changes in outcomes of interest. The study protocol was registered in advance with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO 2016 CRD42016033132). Results: We identified 6 studies (111 patients), representing 5 cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled clinical trial. There was significant decrease in steatosis grading with a standardized mean difference of –2.580 (95% confidence interval [CI] –4.623 to –0.536; P = 0.013) and NAFLD activity score standardized mean difference of –1.488 (95% CI –2.506 to –0.471; P = 0.004). However, there was no significant change in fibrosis stage (0.156; 95% CI –0.553 to 0.865; P = 0.667). Conclusions: Statin use can possibly reduce the extent of steatohepatitis but not the stage of fibrosis. Further randomized controlled studies to assess histological evidence with adequate sample size and duration are required in order to establish the role of statin as a primary treatment of NAFLD."
"Bioactivity of a sol–gel-derived hydroxyapatite coating on titanium implants in vitro and in vivo  2018 Sciendo. All Rights Reserved.Background: Hydroxyapatite is widely used as a coating on metallic implants to promote bioactivity. The coating is typically produced using a high temperature, resulting in phase heterogeneity and coating delamination, which may lead to failure of the coating clinically. Development of a simple and low-temperature hydroxyapatite coating technique may improve the bone bonding ability of implants. Objectives: To investigate responses to hydroxyapatite-coated titanium produced by a newly developed sol–gel by osteoblasts in vitro and bone in vivo. Methods: Osteoblast proliferation was characterized using a methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and cell calcification with an Alizarin red S assay, and the results were compared with those of uncoated titanium. Uncoated and coated screws were inserted into the trabecular bone of New Zealand white rabbit legs. These implants were evaluated mechanically and histologically after 7, 12, and 24 weeks. Results: Hydroxyapatite-coated titanium showed a significantly greater cell proliferation and mineralization than uncoated titanium. Extraction torques for the coated screws increased with time of implantation and were significantly greater than those of uncoated screws. We observed bone fragments attached to the surface of all coated screws after removal, but none on uncoated screws. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained bone showed no active inflammatory responses to implantation at any time examined. Bone surrounding either uncoated or coated screws followed typical remodeling stages, but maturation of bone healing was faster with coated screws. Conclusions: The sol–gel-derived hydroxyapatite coating showed bioactivity, indicating its potential application as an alternative coating technique to improve the bone bonding ability of implants."
"Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation versus conventional chest physiotherapy in children with cerebral palsy  2018 Daedalus Enterprises.BACKGROUND: The cough mechanism is often impaired in children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy, accounting for the high prevalence of pneumonia and atelectasis requiring prolonged hospitalization. Conventional chest physiotherapy (CPT) is a current technique recommended at the onset of lower-respiratory infections in cerebral palsy. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) in children with neuromuscular disease. To date, there has been no study of MI-E in children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy. The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy in reducing hospital stay and improvement of atelectasis between MI-E and CPT in children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy with lower-respiratory infections. METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial. Children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy, age 6 months to 18 y, admitted for lower-respiratory infections and/or atelectasis at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between June 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015, were recruited. Those with pneumothorax, severe pneumonia, active tuberculosis, and shock were excluded. Children were randomized into the MI-E or CPT group. The MI-E group received MI-E (3 therapies/d), and the CPT group received CPT (1 therapy/d). Vital signs per protocol and chest radiograph as needed were recorded. RESULTS: There were 22 children enrolled in the study, 11 in the MI-E and 11 in the CPT group. Demographic data were comparable in both groups. The length of hospital stay was similar in both groups (MI-E 4-24 d vs CPT 6-42 d, P =.15). There were 17 subjects with atelectasis (MI-E [n = 9] versus CPT [n = 8]). In this atelectasis subgroup, MI-E had shortened therapy time when compared with CPT (2.9 ± 0.8 d vs 3.9 ± 0.6 d, P =.01). No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: MI-E is proven to be beneficial in shortening the duration of airway clearance in children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy presenting with lower-respiratory infections and atelectasis. MI-E is a safe and efficient intervention for airway clearance."
"Preoperative radiation in large angiomatosis of the breast, attempting breast conserving surgery: Multidisciplinary approach  2018 Published by Oxford University Press and JSCR Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved. Angiomatosis of the breast is very rare. The presentations are including breast mass, skin discoloration and breast enlargement that mimic to angiosarcoma. The imaging could suggest non-specific vascular tumors. The histology should be obtained for the certain diagnosis. Surgical excision is the standard treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first case that preoperative radiation is given. Currently, radiation is occasionally used in benign condition. This case shows the successful result of preoperative radiation for achieving breast conserving surgery in large angiomatosis of the breast."
"A comparison of angular values of the pelvic limb with normal and medial patellar luxation stifles in Chihuahua dogs using radiography and computed tomography Copyright  2018 Schattauer.Objective: This article aimed to determine and compare the angular values of the pelvic limb in normal and medial patellar luxation (MPL) stifles in Chihuahuas using radiography and computed tomographic (CT) scan, to identify the relationship between pelvic limb angles and severity of MPL. In addition, radiographic and CT images were compared to determine the more suitable method of limb deformity assessment. Methods: Sixty hindlimbs of Chihuahuas were divided into normal and grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 MPL groups. The pelvic limb angles in frontal and sagittal planes were evaluated on radiography and CT scan. Femoral and tibial torsion angles (FTA and TTA) were evaluated only by CTscan. All angles were compared among normal and MPL stifles and between radiography and CT scan. Results: Based on the CT scan, the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), anatomical caudal proximal femoral angle (aCdPFA), and TTA were related to the severity of MPL. The mLDFA and TTA were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in grade 4 MPL, while the aCdPFA was significantly decreased in grade 2, 3 and 4 MPL groups. There were significant differences of many angles between radiography and CT scan. Clinical Significance: The angles related to MPL in Chihuahuas are aLDFA, mLDFA, aCdPFA and TTA. Radiography had some limitations for evaluating pelvic limb angles. The caudocranial radiograph is recommended for the assessment of the distal femoral angles, while the craniocaudal radiograph is for the tibial angles."
"External levator advancement versus Müller muscle–conjunctival resection for aponeurotic blepharoptosis: A randomized clinical trial Copyright  2018 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.Background: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of external levator advancement and Müller muscle–conjunctival resection in aponeurotic blepharoptosis repair. Methods: Mild to moderate blepharoptosis patients with good levator function and a positive phenylephrine test were randomized to upper blepharoplasty with either external levator advancement or Müller muscle–conjunctival resection. The primary outcome was marginal reflex distance 1 at 1 month after surgery. Secondary outcomes were cosmetic outcome, complications, and operating room time. Results: Forty patients were enrolled, six men and 34 women, with an average age of 62.4 years. The mean preoperative marginal reflex distance 1 in the levator group (39 eyes/20 subjects) and the Müller group (38 eyes/20 subjects) was 1.2 ± 0.8 mm and 1.5 ± 0.7 mm, respectively. The mean postoperative marginal reflex distance 1 in the levator and Müller groups was 3.0 ± 1.0 mm and 3.2 ± 1.0 mm, respectively. The difference in the mean change was 0.008, and was not statistically different (95 percent CI, −0.59 to 0.61; p = 0.978). The mean cosmetic outcome was 2.69 ± 0.81 for the levator group and 3.07 ± 0.68 for the Müller group, with a mean difference of 0.373 (95 percent CI, 0.06 to 0.69; p = 0.020). The average operating room time was 75 ± 19.2 minutes for the levator group and 71 ± 23.6 minutes for the Müller group (p = 0.439). There were four eyes that underwent reoperation, three in the levator group (7.7 percent) and one in the Müller group (2.6 percent). Conclusions: External elevator advancement and Müller muscle–conjunctival resection are both effective in correction of mild to moderate blepharoptosis. However, Müller muscle–conjunctival resection yields a statistically significant better cosmetic outcome and causes less eyelid asymmetry."
"Species identification of non-hybrid and hybrid Pangasiid catfish using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism  2018 Kasetsart UniversitySpecies-diagnostic molecular markers are essential for the identification of species groups possessing overlapping morphological characters. They also play an important role in preventing the supply of incorrect species for the food industry and in verifying the species origins of various forms of products. Molecular genetic markers were developed for the identification of six Pangasiid species—Pangasianodon gigas, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, Pangasius bocourti, Pangasius conchophilus, Pangasius larnaudii and Pangasius sanitwongsei—based on restriction analysis of mitochondrial 16S ribosomal (r) DNA with Tsp 509I, Hinc II and Mfe I and nuclear immunoglobulin M heavy chain constant region (IgM-H) with Taq I and Pst I. Six non-overlapping composite restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns: AAB (AA) (AA), ACB(AA) (BB), BBB(BB) (BB), CCB(BB) (BB), DCA (BB) (CC) and DCB(−) (−) were observed across the respective species. Larvae of P. gigas, P. hypophthalmus, P. bocourti, P. larnaudii and P. sanitwongsei could be unambiguously differentiated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA. In addition, detection of P. hypophthalmus × P. gigas, P. hypophthalmus × P. bocourti and P. hypophthalmus × P. larnaudii hybrids could be carried out using PCR-RFLP analysis of IgM-H."

"Decolorization and detoxification of cationic blue 41 by halotolerant strains  Global Science Publications.Thirty-three salt-tolerant bacteria were tested for azo dye decolorization of cationic blue (CB41). Strains C15-2 and SR5-3aw were the most efficient strains for dye removal in saline conditions. They were able to grow in a wide range of NaCl concentration (0-30%, w/v; optimally in the absence of NaCl). On the basis of the phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities (97.0-99.9%), these strains were identified as Staphylococcus sp. strains C15-2 and Staphylococcus sp. strain SR5-3aw. Their decolorization capability was linearly correlated to the concentration of NaCl up to 15%, w/v, while at high concentration of NaCl (250%, w/v), the decolorization rate was inversely linear. Meanwhile, the relationship between the specific decolorization rate of two Staphylococcus species with the CB41 concentration can be explained by Michaelis-Menten kinetics [Maximal velocity (Vmax) = 1.86-2.86 mg/h, Michaelis constant (Km) = 28.1-47.6 mg/L]. The decolorization products were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and the results represented the biotransformation of CB41 to other metabolite compounds, which were less phytotoxic than the undecolorized dye. According to rapid dye decolorization under saline conditions, these halotolerant bacteria can facilitate the improvement of biological wastewater treatment with economically and environmentally friendly processes."
"Practical management of acne for clinicians: An international consensus from the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne  2017Scientific advances are continually improving the knowledge of acne and contributing to the refinement of treatment options; it is important for clinicians to regularly update their practice patterns to reflect current standards. The Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne is an international group of dermatologists with an interest in acne research and education that has been meeting regularly since 2001. As a group, we have continuously evaluated the literature on acne. This supplement focuses on providing relevant clinical guidance to health care practitioners managing patients with acne, with an emphasis on areas where the evidence base may be sparse or need interpretation for daily practice."
"Shapes of an air taylor bubble in stagnant liquids influenced by different surface tensions  2018 2018.The aim of this work is to propose an empirical model for predicting shapes of a Taylor bubble, which is a part of slug flows, under different values of the surface tension in stagnant liquids by employing numerical simulations. The k-ϵ turbulence model was used in the framework of finite volume method for simulating flow fields in a unit of slug flow and also the pressure distribution on a Taylor bubble surface. Assuming that an air pressure distribution inside the Taylor bubble must be uniform, a grid search method was exploited to find an appropriate shape of a Taylor bubble for six values of surface tension. It was found that the shape of a Taylor bubble would be blunter if the surface tension was increased. This was because the surface tension affected the Froude number, controlling the flow around a Taylor bubble. The simulation results were also compared with the Taylor bubble shape, created by the Dumitrescu-and-Taylor model and former studies in order to ensure that they were consistent. Finally, the empirical model was presented from the simulation results."
"Search for Higgsino pair production in p p collisions at s = 13 TeV in final states with large missing transverse momentum and two Higgs bosons decaying via H → b b  2018 authors.Results are reported from a search for new physics in 13 TeV proton-proton collisions in the final state with large missing transverse momentum and two Higgs bosons decaying via H→bb. The search uses a data sample accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The search is motivated by models based on gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, which predict the electroweak production of a pair of Higgsinos, each of which can decay via a cascade process to a Higgs boson and an undetected lightest supersymmetric particle. The observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the standard model background expectation obtained from control regions in data. Higgsinos in the mass range 230-770 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level in the context of a simplified model for the production and decay of approximately degenerate Higgsinos."
"Search for top squarks and dark matter particles in opposite-charge dilepton final states at s = 13 TeV  2018 CERN.A search for new physics is presented in final states with two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons), jets identified as originating from b quarks, and missing transverse momentum (pTmiss). The search uses proton-proton collision data at s=13 TeV amounting to 35.9 fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected using the CMS detector in 2016. Hypothetical signal events are efficiently separated from the dominant tt background with requirements on pTmiss and transverse-mass variables. No significant deviation is observed from the expected background. Exclusion limits are set in the context of simplified supersymmetric models with pair-produced top squarks. For top squarks, decaying exclusively to a top quark and a neutralino, exclusion limits are placed at 95% confidence level on the mass of the lightest top squark up to 800 GeV and on the lightest neutralino up to 360 GeV. These results, combined with searches in the single-lepton and all-jet final states, raise the exclusion limits up to 1050 GeV for the lightest top squark and up to 500 GeV for the lightest neutralino. For top squarks undergoing a cascade decay through charginos and sleptons, the mass limits reach up to 1300 GeV for top squarks and up to 800 GeV for the lightest neutralino. The results are also interpreted in a simplified model with a dark matter (DM) particle coupled to the top quark through a scalar or pseudoscalar mediator. For light DM, mediator masses up to 100 (50) GeV are excluded for scalar (pseudoscalar) mediators. The result for the scalar mediator achieves some of the most stringent limits to date in this model."
"Physical quantity of residue electrostatic energy in flavin mononucleotide binding protein dimer  2018 Elsevier LtdThe electrostatic (ES) energy of each residue was for the first time quantitatively evaluated in a flavin mononucleotide binding protein (FBP). A residue electrostatic energy (RES) was obtained as the sum of the ES energies between atoms in each residue and all other atoms in the FBP dimer using atomic coordinates obtained by a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. ES is one of the most important energies among the interaction energies in a protein. It is determined from the RES, the residues which mainly contribute to stabilize the structure of each subunit, and the binding energy between two subunits can be estimated. The RES of all residues in subunit A (Sub A) and subunit B (Sub B) were attractive forces, even though the residues contain net negative or positive charges. This reveals that the ES energies of any of the residues can contribute to stabilize the protein structure. The total binding ES energy over all residues among the subunits was distributed between −0.2 to −1.2 eV (mean = −0.67 eV) from the MD simulation time."
"Differential diagnosis for pythiosis using thermophilic helicase DNA amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism (tHDA-RFLP)  The Author 2017.Pythiosis is caused by Pythium insidiosum, a fungus-like microbe belonging to the kingdom Stramenopila. Its diagnosis is challenging due to clinical and histopathological similarities with the fungal microbes that cause mucormycosis and entomophthoramycosis. In addition, the proper identification of P. insidiosum in the clinical laboratory is difficult. We have developed a rapid and accurate, species-specific identification method using a thermophilic helicase DNA amplification (tHDA) technique, to differentiate this pathogen from closely related pathogenic fungi. Sixty-seven fungal isolates, including 39 of P. insidiosum, were evaluated. A 91 base-pair (bp) DNA fragment was consistently amplified using a COX2 primer. The limiting concentrations of the one- and two-step tHDA protocols were 100 picograms (1.74 × 102 copies) and 100 femtograms (1.74 × 101 copies), respectively. The CviKI-1 enzyme in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with the 91 bp amplicons accurately separated P. insidiosum from other fungal species. The data suggest that this tHDA-RFLP assay is a rapid and accurate test for the identification of P. insidiosum. The potential use of the assay directly in clinical samples is also discussed."
"Diversity of yeasts and their ethanol production at high temperature  2018 Vasana Tolieng et al.Thirty one yeasts isolated from sugarcane juice and process-sediments collected from different area of sugar factory were screened for ethanol production at 40°C. The isolates were belonged to 7 genera, namely Pichia, Ogataea, Millerozyma, Meyerozyma, Candida, Kluyveromyces and Saccharomyces based on phylogenetic analysis of D1/D2 region of the large subunit ribosomal (LSU) RNA gene. The majority of the isolates were identified as Pichia kudriavzevii (Group IB, 14 isolates), Ogataea polymorpha (Group II, 5 isolates), Kluyveromyces maxianus (Group VI, 5 isolates), Pichia manshurica (Group IA, 3 isolates), while the minor isolates were Candida tropicalis (Group V, 1 isolate), Millerozyma farinosa (Group III, 1 isolate), Meyerozyma caribbica (Group IV, 1 isolate) and Sacharomyces cereviseae (Group VII, 1 isolate). The isolates produced ethanol ranged from 2.97 to 57.10 g/L at 40°C. Isolates G3-9(1) and G3-3(1), identified as K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae showed high potential for ethanol production, 57.10 ± 0.23 and 49.42 ± 0.34 g/L, respectively."
"Measurements of the p p → Z Z production cross section and the Z → 4 ℓ branching fraction, and constraints on anomalous triple gauge couplings at √s=13TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.Four-lepton production in proton-proton collisions, p p → (Z / γ∗) (Z / γ∗) → 4 ℓ, where ℓ= e or μ, is studied at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1. The ZZ production cross section, σ(pp→ZZ)=17.2±0.5(stat)±0.7(syst)±0.4(theo)±0.4(lumi) pb, measured using events with two opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs produced in the mass region 60<mℓ+ℓ-<120GeV, is consistent with standard model predictions. Differential cross sections are measured and are well described by the theoretical predictions. The Z boson branching fraction to four leptons is measured to be B(Z=4.8±0.2(stat)±0.2(syst)±0.1(theo)±0.1(lumi)×10-6 for events with a four-lepton invariant mass in the range 80<m4ℓ<100GeV and a dilepton mass m4GeV for all opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs. The results agree with standard model predictions. The invariant mass distribution of the four-lepton system is used to set limits on anomalous ZZZ and ZZγ couplings at 95% confidence level: -0.0012<f4Z<0.0010, -0.0010<f5Z<0.0013, -0.0012<f4γ<0.0013, -0.0012<f5γ<0.0013."
"Electrochemical reduction of bicarbonate on carbon nanotube-supported silver oxide: An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study  2018 Elsevier LtdBicarbonate reduction on a silver-oxide (Ag2O)-based electrode was studied via cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The effects of electrode composition, electrolyte concentration and the scan rate (10–250 mV/s) were investigated at a temperature of 27 °C. An optimum mass ratio of 70/30 (Ag2O/CNT) led to a maximum current density of 83 mA cm−2 at −0.43 V (VS Ag/AgCl). At scan rates between 10 and 250 mV/s, a negative shift with a displacement of around 1.032 V was observed – indicating the presence of irreversible reduction reactions. The observed irreversibility suggested that the reaction mechanism can be described by both diffusion and adsorption phenomena. The standard heterogeneous rate constant (ko) and the formal redox potential (Eo) were found to be 1.51 × 10−4 cm/s and 1.218 V, respectively. The EIS results confirmed the formation of the inductive loops at reduction potentials – a consequence of the adsorption of the generated species. A reduction in charge transfer resistance and a continual drop in the potential from −0.1 down to −1.4 V was also observed. This was accompanied by H2 evolution and bicarbonate production. The calculated pKa value of 10.20 upon the completion of the bicarbonate reduction reactions, confirmed the conversion of bicarbonate to carbonate ions."
"The low temperature selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur on TiO2 supported V2O5 catalysts  2018 Elsevier LtdThe selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur at low temperature (130 °C) was investigated on various TiO2-supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The TiO2 supports were commercially available pure anatase TiO2 (dXRD 21 and 43 nm with specific surface area 63 and 10 m2/g, respectively), solvothermal-synthesized pure anatase TiO2 (dXRD 15 nm, 69 m2/g), P-25 TiO2 (mixed anatase/rutile phase, 46 m2/g), and rutile TiO2 (dXRD 40 nm, 6 m2/g). In order to obtain high catalytic activity of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts, a combination of highly dispersed vanadium oxides and a strong interaction of V-Ti species were found to be necessary. As revealed by the XPS, Raman, and O2-TPD results, the interaction between active V component and TiO2 support was shown by the presence of partially reduced V-Ti species. Due to the strong interaction between V and TiO2 support, the active V component, which was not fully oxidized, led to more oxygen vacancies being formed and facilitated a rapid catalyst regeneration from V4+ to V5+ (re-oxidation). Hence, the capability of the catalysts for H2S removal was greatly enhanced. Among them, the V2O5 supported on anatase TiO2 with dXRD 21 nm exhibited the best catalyst performances using the feed molar ratio (O2/H2S) of 0.5."
"Heavy metal sequestration with a boronic acid-functionalized carbon-based adsorbent  2018 Elsevier LtdHighly efficient heavy metal adsorption was achieved using carbon microspheres (CMs) functionalized with boronic acid (B-CMs). The adsorbent B-CMs were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of xylose and subsequent functionalization. They had a nonporous structure with a surface area of 76.1 m2/g and the presence of boronic acids on their surface was confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The distribution of boronic acid on the surface of the B-CMs was analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The adsorption kinetics for Cu(II), Ni(II), and Cr(VI) ions best fitted a pseudo-second-order model, while the adsorption isotherms best fitted the Freundlich model, with Ni(II) showing the highest adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity for these three metal ions decreased by less than 10% and 15–25% after one and three uses, respectively. Thus, considering that the B-CMs showed high adsorption capacities and were derived from agricultural waste (xylose) by a simple hydrothermal process, they seem highly suited for use as efficient and environment-friendly heavy metal adsorbents."
"Search for standard model production of four top quarks with same-sign and multilepton final states in proton–proton collisions at √s=13TeV  2018, CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.A search for standard model production of four top quarks (t t ¯ t t ¯) is reported using events containing at least three leptons (e , μ) or a same-sign lepton pair. The events are produced in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV at the LHC, and the data sample, recorded in 2016, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb-1. Jet multiplicity and flavor are used to enhance signal sensitivity, and dedicated control regions are used to constrain the dominant backgrounds. The observed and expected signal significances are, respectively, 1.6 and 1.0 standard deviations, and the t t ¯ t t ¯ cross section is measured to be 16.9-11.4+13.8fb, in agreement with next-to-leading-order standard model predictions. These results are also used to constrain the Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson to be less than 2.1 times its expected standard model value at 95% confidence level."
"Search for supersymmetry in events with at least three electrons or muons, jets, and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for new physics is carried out in events with at least three electrons or muons in any combination, jets, and missing transverse momentum. Results are based on the sample of proton-proton collision data produced by the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and collected by the CMS experiment in 2016. The data sample analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Events are classified according to the number of b jets, missing transverse momentum, hadronic transverse momentum, and the invariant mass of same-flavor dilepton pairs with opposite charge. No significant excess above the expected standard model background is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are computed for four different supersymmetric simplified models with pair production of gluinos or third-generation squarks. In the model with gluino pair production, with subsequent decays into a top quark-antiquark pair and a neutralino, gluinos with masses smaller than 1610 GeV are excluded for a massless lightest supersymmetric particle. In the case of bottom squark pair production, the bottom squark masses are excluded up to 840 GeV for charginos lighter than 200 GeV. For a simplified model of heavy top squark pair production, the t ˜ 2mass is excluded up to 720, 780, or 710 GeV for models with an exclusive t ˜ 2→ t ˜ 1H decay, an exclusive t ˜ 2→ t ˜ 1Z decay, or an equally probable mix of those two decays. In order to provide a simplified version of the analysis for easier interpretation, a small set of aggregate signal regions also has been defined, providing a compromise between simplicity and analysis sensitivity.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Immunogenicity and safety of WHO-approved TRC-ID regimen with a chromatographically purified Vero cell rabies vaccine with or without rabies immunoglobulin in children  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Introduction: Children are at risk of rabies exposure in many Asian countries. The safety and immunogenicity profile of the WHO-approved two-site intradermal Thai Red Cross regimen (modified TRC-ID regimen; 2–2-2–0-2) with a new chromatographically purified Vero-cell rabies vaccine (CPRV) is lacking. Area covered: We studied the safety and immunogenicity of the TRC-ID regimen with a new CPRV in non-immunized Thai children with possible or proven rabies exposure. Thirty-nine seronegative patients (age range 2–14 years) with rabies exposure (WHO categories II or III) received two 0.1-mL intradermal doses of CPRV at both deltoid regions on days 0, 3, 7, and 28. Twenty-five patients (64.1%) received rabies immunoglobulin due to having rabies exposure, according to WHO category III. All serum samples were tested for rabies neutralizing antibody (Nab) by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) before vaccination, and on days 14 and 90 after vaccination. All patients had an adequate immune response (Nab titers ≥ 0.5 IU/mL) on days 14 and 90. No patients died of rabies infection. No serious adverse reactions were observed. Expert commentary: CPRV is economic, safe, and immunogenic if given as the modified TRC-ID regimen in children."
"Constraints on the double-parton scattering cross section from same-sign W boson pair production in proton-proton collisions at √s=8 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A first search for same-sign WW production via double-parton scattering is performed based on proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV using dimuon and electron-muon final states. The search is based on the analysis of data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1. No significant excess of events is observed above the expected single-parton scattering yields. A 95% confidence level upper limit of 0.32 pb is set on the inclusive cross section for same-sign WW production via the double-parton scattering process. This upper limit is used to place a 95% confidence level lower limit of 12.2 mb on the effective double-parton cross section parameter, closely related to the transverse distribution of partons in the proton. This limit on the effective cross section is consistent with previous measurements as well as with Monte Carlo event generator predictions."
"Natural regulatory IgM-mediated autoimmune responses directed against malondialdehyde regulate oxidative and nitrosative pathways and coupled with IgM responses to nitroso adducts attenuate depressive and physiosomatic symptoms at the end of term pregnancy  2017 The Authors. Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences  2017 Japanese Society of Psychiatry and NeurologyAim: We aimed to delineate the effects of immunoglobulin (Ig)M-mediated autoimmune responses directed against malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitroso (SNO) adducts on nitro-oxidative stress and depressive and physiosomatic symptoms (DPSS) at the end of term. Methods: IgM responses to MDA, NO (nitroso) adducts formed by nitrosylation, and NO2 tyrosine formed by nitration were measured as well as hydroperoxides (ferrous oxidation xylenol orange), advanced protein oxidation products (AOPP), and NO metabolite (NOx) levels in women at the end of term pregnancy and in normal controls. Results: IgM responses to MDA were significantly and inversely associated with AOPP, ferrous oxidation xylenol orange, and NOx and DPSS. IgM responses to NO adducts were significantly and inversely associated with DPSS and positively with NOx levels. There were significant associations between IgM responses to MDA, NO adducts, and NO2 tyrosine. The DPSS score was predicted by AOPP and a lifetime history of premenstrual syndrome (both positively) and IgM responses to NO adducts (inversely). Furthermore, 71.8% of the variance in the index of nitro-oxidative stress was explained by lowered IgM responses to MDA, antioxidant levels (zinc, total radical trapping parameter), and inflammatory mediators. Conclusion: Lowered levels of IgM responses to MDA during pregnancy are accompanied by a reduced regulation of nitro-oxidative processes thereby explaining increased oxidative and nitrosative stress biomarkers in association with DPSS. IgM responses to NO adducts, which reflect nitrosylation as a consequence of increased NO production, regulate DPSS symptoms at the end of term and are a trait marker of major depression. IgM responses to MDA are a key part of the compensatory anti-inflammatory responses system."
"Dependence of Informal Interest Rates and Level of Lenders’ Influence in the Informal Loan Market in Thailand  2018, International Atlantic Economic Society.Informal finance with usurious interest rates seems to be the last resort for the poor in many developing countries. In Thailand, informal credit lenders can freely set up extortionate interest rates and use controversial enforcement actions to pressure borrowers to repay loans, because that legal enforcement is not practical due to the low punishment levels for those lenders. Despite widespread interest in the determinants of the informal interest rates, it remains a largely unexplored area. This study investigates whether level of lenders’ influence over the borrower, and some characteristics of the borrowers, are related to informal interest rates, enabling the rates to be classified into particular categories. Ordered logistic regression is used to analyze the data. The investigation was based on information collected in a survey presented to a sampled population of 694 participants from Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Phathum Thani, and Samut Prakan where the number of informal loans during the last seven years is highest when compared to other regions of the country. The results suggest that the level of lenders’ influence over the borrower in order to obtain a loan correlates with the informal interest rates applied. Moreover, some characteristics of a borrower, i.e., debt-to-income ratio and high level of familiarity between an informal lender and a borrower, also significantly affect the rates."
"Culture and its influences on dental education  2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: Culture is an important factor influencing how students develop learning and how educators provide support to students. The aim of this paper is to explore a concept of national European cultures, and relationships between culture and educational practice with the intention of helping the dental profession gain a better understanding of effective teaching and learning in dentistry. Content: Culture represents the collective behaviours, values and beliefs of people in a society. How people react to education is partly explained by culture. Students utilise different culturally based strategies to develop learning. We apply Hofstede's model to explore European cultures and implications for dental education and educational practice. Most Western students possess assimilating learning styles enabling them to learn effectively in student-centred contexts while most Eastern students have accommodating learning styles and are more familiar with teacher-centred learning. Eastern students may need to adapt their approach to learning to better benefit from student-centred learning. Conclusion: Culture influences students’ learning and educational practice. Dental educators should be aware of such influences and provide support that acknowledges students’ different cultural backgrounds. Cultural competence is fundamental for effective teaching and learning in dentistry."
"Psychometric properties of the Parental Feeding Behaviours Questionnaire for Indonesian parents of young children  2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdPurpose: The objective of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the Parental Feeding Behaviours Questionnaire (PFBQ) to measure feeding behaviours of Indonesian parents of toddlers (young children). Methods: A total of 696 parents of toddlers were obtained by convenience sampling during September 2013 to April 2014. To validate the PFBQ, confirmatory factor analysis and the contrasted group technique were conducted. Reliability of this instrument was examined by construct reliability and test-retest reliability. Results: Results showed that the regression coefficients of all 56 indicators were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The contrasted group technique showed significantly different parental feeding behaviours between parents of well-nourished and malnourished toddlers (P = 0.047). The test-retest reliability of the PFBQ was acceptable (Pearson correlation = 0.644), and the construct reliability ranged from 0.88 to 0.96. Conclusions: The PFBQ is a valid and reliable instrument; however, more studies are required to identify acceptable tools to measure more culturally diverse range of parental feeding behaviours."
"Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) infection in grower pigs from a Thai farm suffering from porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC)  2018 Elsevier B.V.Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is a newly emerging virus with unknown pathogenesis. The major objective of this study was to investigate the presence of PCV3 in pigs from a farm in Thailand suffering from porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Initially, a Thai PCV3 strain (PCV3/Thailand/PB01/17) was identified from a pig originated from a farm with PRDC problem during grower period and whole genome analysis showed that the Thai PCV3 shared highest nucleotide identity of 99.60% with the South Korean strain PCV3/KU-1602. The presence of PCV3 infection in PRDC-affected pigs was then investigated in this farm. Serum samples from clinically healthy pigs and pigs showing PRDC-related clinical signs during 5–18 weeks were used in PCV3 detection by PCR. The results showed that the PRDC-affected pigs exhibited higher prevalence of PCV3 infection and higher PCV3 titers comparing with the clinically healthy pigs. These results confirmed the presence of PCV3 in a Thai farm with PRDC problem. The pathogenesis of PCV3 on PRDC should be clarified in further studies."
"Locus of Control and its Intergenerational Implications for Early Childhood Skill Formation  2016 Royal Economic SocietyThis article builds upon Cunha's (2015) subjective rationality model in which parents have a subjective belief about the impact of their investment on their children's early skill formation. We propose that this subjective belief is determined partly by locus of control (LOC), i.e. the extent to which individuals believe that their actions can influence future outcomes. Consistent with the theory, we show that maternal LOC measured at the 12th week of gestation strongly predicts maternal attitudes towards parenting style and actual time investments. We also utilise maternal LOC to improve the specification typically used to estimate skill production function parameters."
"Rabies: Changing prophylaxis and new insights in pathophysiology  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Purpose of review Despite great progress in decoding disease mechanisms, rabies remains one of the leading causes of human death worldwide. Towards the elimination of human rabies deaths by 2030, feasible and affordable post (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) must be available with expansion to rural areas in rabies endemic countries. Vaccination and population control of dogs, principal reservoirs and transmitters, must be done in concert. Recent finding Advances in the understanding of rabies neuropathogenesis and pathophysiology are reviewed, including recent experimental findings on host- A nd virus-specific mechanisms mediating neuronal survival and explaining clinical differences in furious and paralytic rabies. The forthcoming World Health Organization guide on rabies based on pathogenesis and immunization mechanisms data with support by clinical evidence provide new accelerated 1 week intradermal PrEP and PEP schedules. Rabies immunoglobulin injected into the wound only is endorsed at amounts not exceeding the dose interfering with active immunization. Potential therapeutics as designed in accord with rabies neuro-pathophysiology are plausible. Summary Clinical practice and rabies awareness can be leveraged by transboundary collaboration among different areas. Advancement in prophylaxis and perspectives on animal control offer a new path to conquer rabies by 2030."
"The Effectiveness of Intravenous Parecoxib on the Incidence of Ipsilateral Shoulder Pain After Thoracotomy: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial  2018 Elsevier Inc.Objectives: To determine the incidence of ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP) with the therapeutic use of parecoxib compared with a placebo after thoracotomy. Design: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: A tertiary-care university hospital. Participants: Adult patients undergoing an elective thoracotomy between June 2011 and February 2015. Interventions: Patients were allocated randomly into the parecoxib group (n = 80) and the control group (n = 80). In the parecoxib group, 40 mg of parecoxib was diluted into 2 mL and given intravenously 30 minutes before surgery and then every 12 hours postoperatively for 48 hours. In the control group, 2 mL of normal saline was given to the patients at the same intervals. Measurements and Main Results: A numerical rating scale was used to assess the intensity of ISP at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after surgery. Intravenous morphine (0.05 mg/kg) was used as the rescue medication for ISP during the 96-hour period. Baseline characteristics of patients in both groups were comparable. Patients in the parecoxib group had a significantly lower incidence of ISP, both overall (42.5% v 62.0%, p = 0.014) and of moderate-to-severe ISP when compared with the control group (26.2% v 49.4%, p = 0.003). Parecoxib reduced the risk of ISP by a statistically significant 32% (risk ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.93, p = 0.016). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse effects between the groups. Conclusions: Intravenous parecoxib significantly can reduce the incidence and severity of ISP after thoracotomy."
"Recovery stress enhancement in shape memory composites from silicon carbide whisker–filled benzoxazine-epoxy polymer alloy  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.In this research, the benzoxazine-epoxy shape memory polymers with outstanding recovery stress improvement were prepared by filling with highly adamantine silicon carbide whisker at 0–20 wt%. The results revealed that the storage modulus at room temperature increased with increasing silicon carbide whisker, that is, from 5.1 GPa (without silicon carbide whisker) to 8.8 GPa (at 20 wt%). Glass transition temperatures were increased with increasing silicon carbide whisker in the range of 154°C–170°C. Furthermore, all samples exhibited approximately 99% of shape fixity with recovery time ranging from 8 to 27 min. Interestingly, the incorporation of silicon carbide whisker could significantly increase recovery stress from 3.4 MPa (without silicon carbide whisker) to 11.2 MPa (at 20 wt%). Moreover, the addition of silicon carbide whisker provides microwave actuating ability to the sample. Recovery time under microwave heating was significantly shortened to be in a range of 3–5 min. These results suggest potential use of the composites as microwave-responsive sensors and other shape memory devices."

Different salt concentrations (0, 1 and 2 wt%) and the type of salt (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, and RbCl) were investigated. The results showed that the two-phase region of the ternary system enlarged by addition of salt. NRTL model was applied, and good correlation between the experimental data and the model was achieved as confirmed by the low rmsd values."
"Cancer stem cell-suppressing activity of chrysotoxine, a bibenzyl from Dendrobium pulchellum Copyright  2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been recognized as rare populations driving cancer progression, metastasis, and drug resistance in leading cancers. Attempts have been made toward identifying compounds that specifically target these CSCs. Therefore, investigations of novel therapeutic strategies for CSC targeting are required. The cytotoxic effects of chrysotoxine on human non-small cell lung cancer-derived H460 and H23 cells were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The effects of chrysotoxine suppression of CSC-like phenotypes were determined in CSC-rich populations and primary CSCs in three-dimensional (3D) culture and in an extreme limiting dilution assay. Expression of CSC markers and associated proteins was determined by Western blot analyse and flow cytometry. We have reported herein the CSC-suppressing activity of chrysotoxine, a bibenzyl compound isolated from Dendrobium pulchellum. We have shown, to our knowledge for the first time, that chrysotoxine dramatically suppresses CSC-like phenotypes of H460 and H23 cells. Treatment with chrysotoxine significantly reduced the viability of 3D CSC-rich populations and concomitantly decreased known CSC markers. Chrysotoxine suppressed CSC phenotypes through downregulation of Src/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. Active (phosphorylated Y416) Src was shown to regulate cancer stemness, since ectopic overexpression of Src strongly activated Akt and subsequently enhanced pluripotency transcription factor SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2 (Sox2)-mediating CSC phenotypes, whereas the short hairpin RNA of Src and an Src inhibitor (dasatinib) suppressed Akt, Sox2, and CSC properties. Importantly, chrysotoxine was shown to suppress active Src/Akt signaling and in turn depleted Sox2-mediated CSCs. Our findings indicate a novel CSC-targeted role of chrysotoxine and its regulation by Src/Akt and Sox2, which may be exploited for cancer treatment."
"Results of a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Trial of Trifluridine/Tipiracil (TAS-102) Monotherapy in Asian Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: The TERRA Study  2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.Purpose: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) was effective in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in a phase II Japanese trial. This regional trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of trifluridine/tipiracil in Asian patients with mCRC with or without exposure to biologic therapy. Patients and Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial was conducted at 30 sites in China, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand. Patients ≥ 18 years old with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum and known KRAS status who were refractory or intolerant to two or more prior chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; minimization method) to receive trifluridine/tipiracil (twice per day orally; 5 days on and 2 days off for 2 weeks, followed by 14 days off per cycle) or placebo. The primary end point was overall survival (intent-to-treat population). Results: Between October 16, 2013, and June 15, 2015, 406 patients were randomly assigned to receive trifluridine/tipiracil (n = 271) or placebo (n = 135). Risk of death was significantly lower in the trifluridine/tipiracil arm than in the placebo arm (hazard ratio for death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.99; log-rank P = .035). Median overall survival was significantly longer in the trifluridine/tipiracil than in the placebo arm (7.8 months [95% CI, 7.1 to 8.8 months] v 7.1 months [95% CI, 5.9 to 8.2 months], respectively), for a median survival follow-up time of 13.8 months (95% CI, 13.1 to 15.3 months) compared with 13.4 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 17.3 months), respectively. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the arms (trifluridine/tipiracil, n = 63 [23.2%]; placebo, n = 32 [23.7%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion: Trifluridine/tipiracil has a statistically significant survival benefit compared with placebo in Asian patients with mCRC refractory or intolerant to standard chemotherapies, regardless of exposure to biologic therapy. The safety profile is similar to previous reports."
"Stochastic Gabor reflectivity and acoustic impedance inversion  2018 Sinopec Geophysical Research Institute.To delineate subsurface lithology to estimate petrophysical properties of a reservoir, it is possible to use acoustic impedance (AI) which is the result of seismic inversion. To change amplitude to AI, removal of wavelet effects from the seismic signal in order to get a reflection series, and subsequently transforming those reflections to AI, is vital. To carry out seismic inversion correctly it is important to not assume that the seismic signal is stationary. However, all stationary deconvolution methods are designed following that assumption. To increase temporal resolution and interpretation ability, amplitude compensation and phase correction are inevitable. Those are pitfalls of stationary reflectivity inversion. Although stationary reflectivity inversion methods are trying to estimate reflectivity series, because of incorrect assumptions their estimations will not be correct, but may be useful. Trying to convert those reflection series to AI, also merging with the low frequency initial model, can help us. The aim of this study was to apply non-stationary deconvolution to eliminate time variant wavelet effects from the signal and to convert the estimated reflection series to the absolute AI by getting bias from well logs. To carry out this aim, stochastic Gabor inversion in the time domain was used. The Gabor transform derived the signal's time-frequency analysis and estimated wavelet properties from different windows. Dealing with different time windows gave an ability to create a time-variant kernel matrix, which was used to remove matrix effects from seismic data. The result was a reflection series that does not follow the stationary assumption. The subsequent step was to convert those reflections to AI using well information. Synthetic and real data sets were used to show the ability of the introduced method. The results highlight that the time cost to get seismic inversion is negligible related to general Gabor inversion in the frequency domain. Also, obtaining bias could help the method to estimate reliable AI. To justify the effect of random noise on deterministic and stochastic inversion results, a stationary noisy trace with signal-to-noise ratio equal to 2 was used. The results highlight the inability of deterministic inversion in dealing with a noisy data set even using a high number of regularization parameters. Also, despite the low level of signal, stochastic Gabor inversion not only can estimate correctly the wavelet's properties but also, because of bias from well logs, the inversion result is very close to the real AI. Comparing deterministic and introduced inversion results on a real data set shows that low resolution results, especially in the deeper parts of seismic sections using deterministic inversion, creates significant reliability problems for seismic prospects, but this pitfall is solved completely using stochastic Gabor inversion. The estimated AI using Gabor inversion in the time domain is much better and faster than general Gabor inversion in the frequency domain. This is due to the extra number of windows required to analyze the time-frequency information and also the amount of temporal increment between windows. In contrast, stochastic Gabor inversion can estimate trustable physical properties close to the real characteristics. Applying to a real data set could give an ability to detect the direction of volcanic intrusion and the ability of lithology distribution delineation along the fan. Comparing the inversion results highlights the efficiency of stochastic Gabor inversion to delineate lateral lithology changes because of the improved frequency content and zero phasing of the final inversion volume."
"Alu siRNA to increase Alu element methylation and prevent DNA damage  2018 Apiwat Mutirangura.Global DNA hypomethylation promoting genomic instability leads to cancer and deterioration of human health with age. Aim: To invent a biotechnology that can reprogram this process. Methods: We used Alu siRNA to direct Alu interspersed repetitive sequences methylation in human cells. We evaluated the correlation between DNA damage and Alu methylation levels. Results: We observed an inverse correlation between Alu element methylation and endogenous DNA damage in white blood cells. Cells transfected with Alu siRNA exhibited high Alu methylation levels, increased proliferation, reduced endogenous DNA damage and improved resistance to DNA damaging agents. Conclusion: Alu methylation stabilizes the genome by preventing accumulation of DNA damage. Alu siRNA could be useful for evaluating reprograming of the global hypomethylation phenotype in cancer and aging cells."
"Newborn traits associated with pre-weaning growth and survival in piglets Copyright  2018 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.Objective: Piglet pre-weaning mortality is an important variable indicating the efficacy of farrowing management and animal well-being during lactation. The present study determined the association of newborn traits measured soon after birth with piglet pre-weaning mortality and growth. Methods: In total, 805 piglets born from 57 multiparous sows were investigated. Their blood oxygen saturation, blood glucose and rectal temperature at 24 h after birth (RT24h) were monitored. Birth order, sex, skin color, integrity of the umbilical cord, attempts to stand and birth intervention were monitored. Piglets were weighed at day 0, 7, and 21 to evaluate average daily gain (ADG). Results: Piglet pre-weaning mortality for lactation period was 12.6% and cumulative mortality during the first 7 days of age was 8.6%. A higher proportion of piglets with pale skin color died compared to piglets with normal skin color (26.7% vs 7.7%, p<0.001). A higher (p<0.001) proportion of piglets that attempted to stand after 5 min (38.5%) died compared to piglets that attempted to stand within 1 min (6.3%) after birth. Piglet body weight at birth (BWB), blood glucose and the number of piglets born alive (BA) were correlated with ADG (p<0.05). Piglets with BWB <1.30 kg had higher (p<0.001) mortality rate than piglets with BWB≥1.80 kg (19.0% vs 3.3%) and piglets with BWB 1.30 to 1.79 kg (4.0%). Piglet with RT24h <37.0°C had higher (p<0.001) mortality rate (86.2%) than piglets with RT24h >38.5°C (3.9%). Conclusion: Low BWB and low RT24h compromise piglet survival during the lactation period in the tropical conditions. Piglets in the litters with a high BA, low BWB and low blood glucose have reduced ADG."
"The Associations of School Oral Health-Related Environments with Oral Health Behaviours and Dental Caries in Children  2018 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.Creating supportive oral health-related environments in schools is an important strategy for promoting schoolchildren's oral health. This study determined the associations between school environments and children's oral behaviour and dental caries. The data on school oral health-related environments were obtained through observation and interviews. Oral behaviour and dental caries data were collected through interviews and oral examinations of 984 sixth grade children. χ2 and multiple logistic regression, adjusted for sociodemographic and economic status, other school environment variables, and oral behaviour were used. Providing fresh fruit with school meals was associated with low sweets consumption and low caries levels. Children's daily sweets consumption was positively associated with sweetened milk sales in schools. Selling sweetened beverages, including sweetened milk, sweetened drinks, and soft drinks, was associated with high caries levels, while selling meat and crispy packed snacks was associated with low caries levels. Children in schools with integrated oral health education were significantly more likely to brush their teeth twice a day and to brush after lunch. In conclusion, school oral health-related environments, especially available food choices, were associated with sweets consumption behaviour and caries levels. Children in schools with integrated oral health education had better brushing habits."
"Cyclodextrin solubilization of celecoxib: solid and solution state characterization  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The low aqueous solubility of celecoxib (CCB) hampers its oral bioavailability and permeation from aqueous environment through biological membranes. The aim of this study was to enhance the aqueous solubility of CCB by complexation with cyclodextrin (CD) in the presence of water-soluble polymer. The effects of different CDs (αCD, βCD, γCD, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and randomly methylated β-cyclodextrin (RMβCD)) and mucoadhesive, water-soluble polymers (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), chitosan and hyaluronic acid) were investigated. The phase solubility profiles and CCB/CD complex characteristics were determined. RMβCD exhibited the greatest solubilizing effect of the two CDs tested. However, γCD was also selected for further investigations due to its safety profile. Addition of polymer to the aqueous CD solutions enhanced the CD solubilization. Formation of CCB/RMβCD/HPMC and CCB/γCD/HPMC ternary complexes resulted in 11 and 19-fold enhancement in the apparent complexation efficiency in comparison to their CCB/CD binary complex, respectively. The size of ternary complex aggregates in solution were determined to be from about 250 to about 350 nm. The data obtained from Fourier transform infra-red, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction indicated presence of CCB/CD inclusion complexes in the solid state. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance data demonstrated that CCB was partially and totally inserted into the hydrophobic central cavities of RMβCD and γCD."
"Socio-economic status and risk of tuberculosis: A case-control study of HIV-infected patients in Asia  2018 The Union.SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related opportunistic infection and cause of acquired immune-deficiency syndrome related death. TB often affects those from a low socio-economic background. OBJECTIVE : To assess the socio-economic determinants of TB in HIV-infected patients in Asia. DESIGN: This was a matched case-control study. HIVpositive, TB-positive cases were matched to HIVpositive, TB-negative controls according to age, sex and CD4 cell count. A socio-economic questionnaire comprising 23 questions, including education level, employment, housing and substance use, was distributed. Socio-economic risk factors for TB were analysed using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULT S : A total of 340 patients (170 matched pairs) were recruited, with 262 (77.1%) matched for all three criteria. Pulmonary TB was the predominant type (n = 115, 67.6%). The main risk factor for TB was not having a university level education (OR 4.45, 95%CI 1.50-13.17, P=0.007). Burning wood or coal regularly inside the house and living in the same place of origin were weakly associated with TB diagnosis. CONCLUS IONS : These data suggest that lower socioeconomic status is associated with an increased risk of TB in Asia. Integrating clinical and socio-economic factors into HIV treatment may help in the prevention of opportunistic infections and disease progression."
"Does nebulized hypertonic saline shorten hospitalization in young children with acute viral wheezing?  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Although previous studies have shown benefits of nebulized hypertonic saline (HS) for improving airway clearance and shortening hospitalization in infants with bronchiolitis, prospective blinded studies in preschool children with acute viral wheezing are limited. Objectives: To determine nebulized 3% HS efficacy in young children admitted with acute viral wheezing. Methods: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in children aged 6 months to 5 years admitted with acute viral wheezing from July 1st to December 31st 2016. Patients were randomized to receive inhalation of 2.5 mg salbutamol dissolved in either 3% HS or normal saline (NS). Clinical data, asthma clinical severity score, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were recorded. Results: A total of 47 patients were enrolled (22 in HS and 25 in NS) without significant differences in demographic data and baseline clinical scores. Median LOS and median time of oxygen therapy were significantly shorter in HS than NS group: 48 versus 72 h, P = 0.021 and 36 versus 72 h, P = 0.025, respectively. HS patients had significantly improved asthma clinical severity scores, respiratory rates and oxygen saturation at 12 h compared to NS group (P-value 0.042, 0.032, and 0.043). There were no adverse events. Conclusion: In children under 5 years admitted with acute viral wheezing, nebulized hypertonic saline/salbutamol significantly shortened hospital stay length, time of oxygen therapy, and improved asthma clinical severity score faster than normal saline/salbutamol."
"B-cell activating factor, a predictor of antibody mediated rejection in kidney transplantation recipients  2016 Asian Pacific Society of NephrologyAim: Donor-specific antibody (DSA) is a widely-used biomarker for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) but correctly indicates only 30–40% of patients with ABMR. Additional biomarkers of ABMR in kidney transplant recipients are needed. Methods: All 68 kidney transplanted-recipients enrolled in this study were negative for graft rejection as determined by surveillance-biopsy ELISA at day 7 post-transplantation. Allograft biopsy was then performed at 6 months post-transplantation for subclinical-ABMR detection. Recipients were stratified by pre-transplant DSA and BAFF at day 7 into four groups. Results: During the study period, 13.2% of the recipients demonstrated subclinical-ABMR at 6 months, without patient with clinical ABMR presentations. Overall mean BAFF at day 7 was 393 pg/mL (95% CI = 316–471 pg/mL). The optimal cut-off value for low vs. high BAFF level was 573 pg/mL, with sensitivity and specificity at 77.8% and 88.1%, respectively. Fifty percent of recipients with high BAFF at day 7 (14 patients) and only 3.7% of patients with low BAFF demonstrated ABMR (P < 0.05). Indeed, ABMR was more common in patients high BAFF level (hazard ratio = 7.30; 95% CI = 3.77–14.15). The prevalence of ABMR among negative pre-transplant DSA/low BAFF, positive DSA/low BAFF, negative DSA/high BAFF, and positive DSA/ high BAFF recipients were 4.4, 0, 37.5 and 66.7%, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Post-transplant ABMR can be predicted by perioperative serum BAFF level. Together with DSA testing, BAFF provides additional predictive value for ABMR."
"Expression levels of interferon-ɣ and type 2 deiodinase in patients diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorders  2017 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of SciencesBackground Thyroid hormones (TH) are involved in modulation of the immune system and inflammation. TH dysregulation is associated with depressive disorders. The iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs), the key enzymes for TH synthesis, can be affected and induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. We aimed to investigate the levels of and correlation between type 2 DIO (DIO2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-ɣ) in patients with recurrent depressive disorders (rDD). Methods Data from 91 rDD patients and 105 healthy controls were analyzed. The diagnoses are based on the ICD-10 criteria (F33.0-F33.8). Expression levels of DIO2 and IFN-ɣ were estimated using the method based on the polymerase chain reaction and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The DIO2 expression on mRNA/protein levels in rDD patients (both female and males) was reduced as compared with the control subjects. No correlation between DIO2 and IFN-ɣ expression was observed. Conclusion This is the first study to reveal that one may cautiously suggest that DIO2 may be involved in the development and/or progression of rDD. The mechanisms of TH regulation on depression, however, need further investigation."
"Recent Membrane Developments for CO2 Separation and Capture  2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIncreasing concerns on global warming and climate change have led to numerous attempts and advanced technology developments to tackle the problem of excessive greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere. One of the technical strategies receiving great attention is the application of membrane technology for greenhouse gas separation/capture. Such technology exhibits significant advantages over other conventional methods in terms of removal efficiency, compactness, and environmental friendliness. Many state-of-the-art membrane developments as well as its applications to post-combustion treatment, which could be a promising approach for reducing CO2 emission from point sources, are thoroughly reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive survey on the future perspective of membrane technologies as a potential solution for CO2 removal and utilization is provided."
"Elemental and mineralogical analysis of marine and coastal sediments from Phra Thong Island, Thailand: Insights into the provenance of coastal hazard deposits  2018Sediment records left by coastal hazards (e.g. tsunami and/or storms) may shed light on the sedimentary and hydrodynamic processes happening during such events. Modern onshore and offshore sediment samples were compared with the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, three palaeotsunami and a 2007 storm deposit from Phra Thong Island, Thailand, to determine provenance relationships between these coastal overwash deposits. Sedimentological and stratigraphic characteristics are generally inadequate to discriminate tsunami and storm deposits so a statistical approach (including cluster analysis, principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis) was used based on grain size, mineralogy and trace element geochemistry. The mineral content and trace element geochemistry are statistically inadequate to distinguish the provenance of the modern storm and tsunami deposits at this site, but the mean grain size can potentially discriminate these overwash deposits. The 2007 storm surge deposits were most likely sourced from the onshore sediment environment whereas all four tsunami units statistically differ from each other indicating diverse sediment sources. Our statistical analyses suggest that the 2004 tsunami deposit was mainly derived from nearshore marine sediments. The uppermost palaeotsunami deposit was possibly derived from both onshore and nearshore materials while the lower palaeotsunami deposits showed no clear evidence of their sediment sources. Such complexity raises questions about the origin of the sediments in the tsunami and storm deposits and strongly suggests that local context and palaeogeography are important aspects that cannot be ignored in tsunami provenance studies."
"Psychological Capital for Leader Development  2017,  The Authors 2017.The continual development of leaders is one effective strategy for organizations to compete in today’s rapidly changing society. Despite awareness of this need, human resource professionals and managers find it challenging to promote or encourage ongoing development among leaders. Addressing the need for continuous learning, we extend the construct of psychological capital to the context of leader development. Specifically, leader development psychological capital (LD PsyCap) is defined as an individual’s motivational propensity to develop as a leader and consists of efficacy, hope, optimism, and resilience toward leader development. Using an online survey of 120 leaders, we found that LD PsyCap predicted leader development behaviors beyond other individual differences. We also found that LD PsyCap mediated the relationship between learning climate, organizational support, social support, and workload on leader development behaviors. Promoting LD PsyCap can help facilitate ongoing leader development in organizations."
"Concomitant Psychiatric and Nonalcohol-Related Substance Use Disorders Among Hospitalized Patients with Alcoholic Liver Disease in the United States Copyright  2017 by the Research Society on AlcoholismBackground: Despite that the epidemiological studies on the comorbidity of alcohol misuse and psychiatric disorders have been studied, less is known about the magnitude of these disorders among patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Our aim was to determine the prevalence of psychiatric and substance use disorders among hospitalized ALD patients in the United States. Methods: We utilized a single-level clinical classification software to identify patients with ALD and psychiatric/substance use disorders from the 2011 National Inpatient Sample data. The primary outcome was the prevalence of these disorders among hospitalized patients with ALD (n = 74,972) compared to those with chronic liver diseases not caused by alcohol (n = 350,140) and those without underlying liver diseases (n = 1,447,063). Results: The prevalence of adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression was significantly higher among hospitalized patients with ALD when compared to those with chronic liver diseases not caused by alcohol (all with p-values <0.05). Younger age, female gender, and White race were the independent predictors of psychiatric/substance use disorders among hospitalized patients with ALD. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with ALD have significantly high prevalence of concomitant psychiatric and substance abuse disorders when compared to those with chronic liver diseases not caused by alcohol and those without underlying liver diseases. Screening and appropriate intervention should be implemented as part of routine clinical care for these patients."
"Simultaneous adsorption of silver nanoparticles and silver ions on large pore mesoporous silica  2017 Elsevier LtdLarge pore mesoporous silica was synthesized using citric acid as template and modified with mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane. The MP-Silica exhibited a surface area of 474 m2 g−1 with an average pore diameter of 11 nm (pore diameter ranging from 2 to 30 nm). The material was used in the adsorption of silver ions, AgNPs and simultaneous adsorption of these silver species was also observed. The adsorption of silver ions occurred rapidly and followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model. The adsorption equilibrium of silver ions could be described with a Langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 114.9 mg g−1. In the mixture of AgNPs and silver ions, the adsorption of AgNPs followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model and took place more slowly compared to silver ions due to their larger size. The MP-Silica exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 91.9 mg AgNPs g−1 in the mixture. The adsorption of silver species on MP-Silica occurred through chemisorption via the coordination of these species with thiol groups on the surface. The removal of silver species from wastewater samples and consumer products by MP-Silica was demonstrated."
"Facile synthesis of magnetic hydroxyapatite-supported nickel oxide nanocomposite and its dye adsorption characteristics  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.A novel magnetic hydroxyapatite-supported nickel oxide nanocomposite (NiO–HAP@γ-Fe2O3) was successfully prepared using a combination of co-precipitation and wet impregnation methods and was applied to the adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution. The presence of HAP, γ-Fe2O3, NiO and all elements in NiO–HAP@γ-Fe2O3 was confirmed by XRD, SEM–EDX and ICP-AES. The structure of the resulting nanocomposite was shown by TEM and SEM–EDX to be rod-shaped, measuring 55.8 ± 16.5 nm in length and 27.1 ± 6.2 nm in width, and on the surface of which was uniformly interspersed with NiO nanoparticles (about 21.4 nm average crystallite size) and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (6.7 ± 2.6 nm in diameter). The novel NiO–HAP@γ-Fe2O3 exhibited a high adsorption rate during the first 20 min and reached an equilibrium within 3 h. The adsorption capacity of NiO–HAP@γ-Fe2O3 was significantly higher than that of its precursors (7.20 mg g−1 vs 0.79–1.31 mg g−1). The superior adsorption performance of the novel nanocomposite, which occurred despite its relatively low surface area, is likely attributable to the synergistic mechanisms facilitated by the presence of mixed metal oxides (NiO and γ-Fe2O3) on the adsorbent as well as by the Lewis acidity and basicity of the components of the adsorbent and the adsorbate. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were well-fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model, respectively."
"The experimental investigations on viscosity, surface tension, interfacial tension and solubility of the binary and ternary systems for tributyl phosphate (TBP) extractant in various organic solvents with water: Thermodynamic NRTL model and molecular interaction approach  2017 Elsevier B.V.In order to provide a database for supporting stability in the separation processes, the physical properties of the mixing solutions between extractant and organic solvents, with/without water, were investigated at temperature 303.2 K and pressure 0.1 MPa. The extractant of tributyl phosphate (TBP) as well as the following organic solvents i.e. cyclohexane, n-heptane, kerosene and toluene were selected for use in this work. Further, the physical properties of the mixing solutions such as viscosity, surface tension, interfacial tension and solubility with water were observed when the percent weights of the extractant increased. The principle of intermolecular attraction between the molecules in the mixing solutions was considered in order to explain the tendencies of results. Tie-line data were determined for ascertaining the solubility of extractant in the organic and aqueous phases. A thermodynamic NRTL model was also evaluated and its data compared with the experimental results. Consequently, good correlations were displayed by the root-mean square deviation (rmsd) at values about 2%. Finally, for understanding the solvation of solute and solvent, the molecular interaction behaviors of the molecules in the mixing solutions were examined by spectroscopic analyses."
"Development of high performance microcrystalline cellulose based natural rubber composites using maleated natural rubber as compatibilizer  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The main goal of the present work was to enhance the interfacial interaction between natural rubber (NR) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) using maleated natural rubber (MNR) as compatibilizer. The effect of MNR loading on the cure, mechanical and thermal properties of NR/MCC composites was studied. The variation in the crosslink density, solvent uptake and morphological properties was also analyzed to explain the properties of NR/MCC composites. Significant improvement in the maximum rheometric torque, modulus and tensile strength was observed for NR composite containing 5 phr (parts per hundred of rubber) MCC along with 10 phr MNR in comparison to NR composite containing only 5 phr MCC. The tensile strength increased by 62.52% for NR/MCC composite in presence of 10 phr MNR as compatibilizer in comparison to NR-gum. Thermogravimetric analysis showed the enhancement in thermal stability of NR/MCC composite due to addition of MNR. A mechanism is suggested to describe the interaction of MNR with both NR and MCC."
"Clinical Outcomes for Cystinuria Patients with Unilateral Versus Bilateral Cystine Stone Disease  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.Introduction: Cystinuria is a genetic disorder marked by elevated urinary cystine excretion and recurrent cystine nephrolithiasis. Interestingly, despite seemingly similar contralateral renal anatomy, a subset of cystinuric patients consistently form stones in only one kidney. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes in unilateral vs bilateral cystine stone formers. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study of cystinuric patients evaluated and treated at the University of California, San Francisco between 1994 and 2015 and categorized patients as either unilateral or bilateral stone formers. Clinical presentation, baseline patient demographics, stone procedures, medical therapy regimens, and long-term renal function were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 42 cystine stone patients (22 female, 20 male) were included in the analysis. The median age at first presentation was 18.5 years and median age at study conclusion was 45.5 years. Two-thirds of patients (n = 28) had a history of bilateral stones, whereas one-third (n = 14) had unilateral stones. Medical therapy regimens were similar between groups. Despite an increased average number of lifetime surgeries (7.5 sessions for bilateral vs 3.7 sessions for unilateral, p < 0.05), there was no significant difference in medians of the most recent glomerular filtration rate when compared with unilateral stone formers (81.5 vs 95 mL/min, respectively; p = 0.28). Conclusions: The majority of cystinuric patients within our cohort form stones bilaterally during their lifetime, and require more surgical interventions than unilateral stone formers. Despite this, overall renal function is well preserved in unilateral and bilateral cystinuric stone formers treated with minimally invasive stone extraction procedures."
"The effect of early renal replacement therapy guided by plasma neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin on outcome of acute kidney injury: A feasibility study  2017 Elsevier Inc.Purpose The optimal time and the parameter utilized for decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) in acute kidney injury (AKI) are still controversial. Recently, high levels of plasma NGAL (pNGAL) has been strongly correlated with poor AKI outcome. This is a feasibility study conducted to test whether early RRT initiation guided by pNGAL could improve AKI outcome. Material and methods The study comprised of triage trial and interventional trial running subsequently. As a guide for triage to RRT, we measured pNGAL at the enrollment time. Forty patients with pNGAL ≥ 400 ng/mL (high pNGAL group) were randomized to ‘early’ or 'standard’ group. Patients with pNGAL < 400 ng/mL (n = 20) were defined as low pNGAL group. Results The triggering pNGAL selected AKI patients with more severity of illness and worse clinical outcome. However, in high pNGAL group, early RRT did not result in different 28-day mortality from the standard group. The median numbers of day free from mechanical ventilation were significantly higher in the early RRT group. Conclusions Our finding suggested that it was feasible to use pNGAL to triage severe AKI patients. However, early initiation of RRT in this high risk group did not affect the 28-day mortality."
"Microalgae as feedstock for biodiesel production under ultrasound treatment – A review  2017 Elsevier LtdThe application of ultrasound in biodiesel production has recently emerged as a novel technology. Ultrasound treatment enhances the mass transfer characteristics leading to the increased reaction rate with short reaction time and potentially reduces the production cost. In this review, application of ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production using acid, base and enzyme catalysts is presented. A critical assessment of the current status of ultrasound in biodiesel production was discussed with the emphasis on using ultrasound for efficient microalgae biodiesel production. The ultrasound in the biodiesel production enhances the emulsification of immiscible liquid reactant by microturbulence generated by cavitation bubbles. The major benefit of the ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production is a reduction in reaction time. Several different methods have been discussed to improve the biodiesel production. Overall, this review focuses on the current understanding of the application of ultrasound in biodiesel production from microalgae and to provide insights into future developments."
"Silver diamine fluoride remineralized artificial incipient caries in permanent teeth after bacterial pH-cycling in-vitro  2017 Elsevier LtdObjectives To investigate the remineralizing effect of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) application on enamel artificial caries in adjunct to 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste compared with fluoride toothpaste alone by analyzing the mineral density, depth of remineralization, and remineralization percentage of the lesions. Methods Eighteen artificial caries slabs were created from the proximal surfaces of nine chemically demineralized premolars. The slabs were scanned by Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) to determine the baseline mineral density of the initial lesions and randomly allocated into 2 groups. The test group was applied with 38% SDF in adjunct to fluoride toothpaste and the control group was treated with fluoride toothpaste alone. The specimens underwent bacterial pH-cycling for 5 d and were re-evaluated using Micro-CT. The pre-treatment and post-treatment mineral densities were plotted and the areas under the curves were used to calculate the remineralization percentage of both groups. Results Mineral density significantly increased in both groups after pH-cycling (p < 0.05) although to different depths (control group = 260 μm, test group = 300 μm). The test group demonstrated a significantly higher mineral density to a depth of 120 μm and higher remineralization percentage (p < 0.05) compared with the control group. Conclusion The adjunctive use of 38% SDF enhances the remineralization of initial carious lesions based on mineral density, depth, and remineralization percentage compared with the use of 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste alone. SDF might be used as an adjunct to fluoride toothpaste to remineralize incipient caries lesions on smooth tooth surfaces. Clinical significance In non-compliant patients, the application of 38% SDF might be used as an adjunct to fluoride toothpaste, to remineralize incipient caries lesions of permanent teeth where esthetics is not a concern."
"Drift-flux correlation for gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal pipe  2017 Elsevier Inc.A drift-flux correlation has been often used to predict void fraction of gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal channel due to its simplicity and practicality. The drift-flux correlation includes two important drift-flux parameters, namely, the distribution parameter and void-fraction-weighted-mean drift velocity. In this study, an extensive literature survey for horizontal two-phase flow is conducted to establish void fraction database and to acquire existing drift-flux correlations. A total of 566 data is collected from 12 data sources and 4 flow-regime-dependent and 1 flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlations are identified. The predictive capability of the existing drift-flux correlations is assessed using the collected data. It is pointed out that the drift velocity determined by a regression analysis may include a significant error due to a compensation error between distribution parameter and drift velocity. In this study, a simple flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlation is developed. In the modeling approach, the void-fraction-weighted mean drift velocity is approximated to be 0 m/s, whereas the distribution parameter is given as a simple function of the ratio of non-dimensional superficial gas velocity to non-dimensional mixture volumetric flux. The newly developed correlation shows an excellent predictive capability of void fraction for horizontal two-phase flow. Mean absolute error (or bias), standard deviation (random error), mean relative deviation and mean absolute relative deviation of the correlation are 0.0487, 0.0985, 0.0758 and 0.206, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the correlation is similar to the correlation of Chexal et al. (1991), which was formulated based on the drift-flux parameters by means of many cascading constitutive relationships with numerous empirical parameters."
"pH-responsive selenium nanoparticles stabilized by folate-chitosan delivering doxorubicin for overcoming drug-resistant cancer cells  2017 Elsevier LtdHerein, we first report pH-responsive SeNPs stabilized with modified folic acid-N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC-FA) as nanocarriers for delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) to overcome drug-resistant cancer cells, which could enhance the activity of DOX by approximately 10-fold for a reduced IC50 value compared to free DOX. When nanoparticles were taken up by cells, the DOX-loaded SeNPs@TMC-FA demonstrated a faster release rate under acidic conditions. The cumulative release amount of DOX at pH 5.3 was 54.1% within 2 h and 95.5% at 6 h, whereas the release rate at pH 7.4 was 12.3% in 2 h and 42.2% for 6 h; release was not completed at the end of the study, 72 h. Mechanistic studies suggested that DOX-SeNPs@TMC-FA induced cell death through the apoptosis pathway by involvement of caspase-3 and PARP proteins. The results demonstrated that pH-responsive SeNPs@TMC-FA, as targeted nanocarriers, promoted the efficacy of DOX and overcame drug resistance in NCI/ADR-RES cells."
"Work Engagement in India and Thailand: A Comparative Analysis  2018,  2018 International Management Institute, New Delhi.The study investigated the role of human resource development climate (HRDC) and self-efficacy as predictors of work engagement amongst IT-sector employees of India and Thailand. In addition, it also made an attempt to unfurl the mechanism underlying the proposed relationship by proposing and testing a model with self-efficacy as an intervening variable. Work engagement levels among IT-sector employees in Thailand were found be slightly higher than those among the employees in India. Both HRDC and self-efficacy were found to be significant predictors of work engagement. The results for self-efficacy as a mediator and a moderator of the proposed relationship between HRDC and work engagement are reported and discussed. Article building on the theoretical framework of the job-demands resources model, the social cognitive theory and the conservation of resources (COR) theory produces cross-national knowledge about work engagement and predictors."
"Induction of DNA double-strand breaks in human gingival fibroblasts by eluates from titanium dioxide modified glass ionomer cements  2017 The Academy of Dental MaterialsObjectives: (1) To investigate the genotoxicity of a glass ionomer cement (GIC) and GIC incorporated with titanium dioxide nanopoarticle (TiO2NPs) and with microparticle (TiO2MPs) on DNA double-strand breaks of human gingival fibroblast cells (HGFs). (2) To compare the genotoxic differences between GIC and two modified cements. Methods: TiO2NPsGIC and TiO2MPsGIC were prepared by adding 10% w/w of TiO2NPs and TiO2MPs to the GIC powder and hand-mixed followed the manufacturer instruction. Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) was used as a culture medium for HGFs and eluate preparation. Eluates from all groups were collected for XTT cell viability assay to obtain EC50 values. γ-H2AX immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) of HGFs. Results: EC50 values were from 38% to 60% and eluate concentrations at 20% and 5% were selected for γ-H2AX immunofluorescence assay. At both concentrations, HGFs exposed to eluates from all cements groups had fewer mean foci per cell and higher percentage of free foci cells than H2O2 (p < 0.05). At 20% concentration, cells exposed to eluates from both TiO2NPsGIC and TiO2MPsGIC groups had fewer mean foci per cell and higher percentage of free foci cell than GIC and culture medium (p < 0.05). Significance: Neither GIC nor 10% TiO2-modified GICs had a genotoxic effect on HGFs. Both TiO2NPsGIC and TiO2MPsGIC demonstrated less genotoxic effect than GIC. When comparing between the two modified cements, there was no genotoxic difference between the modified cements from different particle sizes (nanoparticle and micro-particle) of TiO2."
"Chitosan-based polymer hybrids for thermo-responsive nanogel delivery of curcumin  2017The purpose of this study is to design and develop thermoresponsive nano-sized hydrogel particles from a natural polymer, chitosan, as smart material platforms for curcumin delivery. Chitosan was used as the backbone material to be grafted with poly–(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) using an EDC/NHS coupling reaction. The conjugated products were characterized by 1H NMR and TGA. Chitosan-grafted pNIPAM (CS-g-pN) nanogels were prepared by a sonication method. The loading of curcumin into the CS-g-pN nanogels was achieved using an incubation method. Size, morphology of nanogels, amounts of curcumin loaded to the nanogels and cellular uptake were investigated by DLS, TEM, fluorescent spectroscopy and confocal microscopy techniques, respectively. A CellTiter-Blue® cell viability assay was performed in NIH-3T3 and HeLa cells to assess the safety while MTT assay was carried out in MDA-231, Caco-2, HepG2, and HT-29 cells for determining cytotoxic effects. Results showed that CS-g-pN with 3–60% degree of modification were simply assembled into spherical nanogel particles with submicron sizes, in which curcumin was encapsulated. The thermoresponsive behavior of each CS-g-pN nanogel formulation differed due to the grafted pNIPAM length and density. The CS-g-pN nanogel formulations were non-toxic towards NIH-3T3 and HeLa cells. Each curcumin-loaded CS-g-pN nanogel formulation could be up taken into NIH-3T3 cell lines and showed the dose-dependent cytotoxicity against tested cell lines. Successful development of this curcumin-loaded nanogel will lead to advanced materials that can be functionalized and optimized for targeted therapy and controlled delivery of small molecules and/or biomolecules for biomedical applications."
"Mineralogical and geochemical characterization of waste rocks from a gold mine in northeastern Thailand: application for environmental impact protection  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Waste rocks from gold mining in northeastern Thailand are classified as sandstone, siltstone, gossan, skarn, skarn-sulfide, massive sulfide, diorite, and limestone/marble. Among these rocks, skarn-sulfide and massive sulfide rocks have the potential to generate acid mine drainage (AMD) because they contain significant amounts of sulfide minerals, i.e., pyrrhotite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, and chalcopyrite. Moreover, both sulfide rocks present high contents of As and Cu, which are caused by the occurrence of arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite, respectively. Another main concern is gossan contents, which are composed of goethite, hydrous ferric oxide (HFO), quartz, gypsum, and oxidized pyroxene. X-ray maps using electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) indicate distribution of some toxic elements in Fe-oxyhydroxide minerals in the gossan waste rock. Arsenic (up to 1.37 wt.%) and copper (up to 0.60 wt.%) are found in goethite, HFO, and along the oxidized rim of pyroxene. Therefore, the gossan rock appears to be a source of As, Cu, and Mn. As a result, massive sulfide, skarn-sulfide, and gossan have the potential to cause environmental impacts, particularly AMD and toxic element contamination. Consequently, the massive sulfide and skarn-sulfide waste rocks should be protected from oxygen and water to avoid an oxidizing environment, whereas the gossan waste rocks should be protected from the formation of AMD to prevent heavy metal contamination."
"Associations between severity of anxiety and clinical and biological features of major affective disorders  2017Patients with major affective disorders (MAFD) with comorbid anxiety show a greater functional impairment than those without anxiety. The aim of this study is to delineate the associations between severity of anxiety in MAFD, namely bipolar disorder (BD) and major depression (MDD), and MAFD characteristics and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Recruited were 82 participants with anxiety disoders and 83 without anxiety disoders, including 101 MAFD patients and 51 healthy controls. We used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) to measure severity of anxiety and made the diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and phobias. The HAM-A score is significantly predicted by higher number of depressive episodes, GAD and phobias, childhood trauma, tobacco use disorder, metabolic syndrome and lowered HDL-cholesterol. Increased HAM-A scores are, independently from severity of depression, associated with lowered quality of life, increased disabilities and suicidal ideation. Lithium treatment significantly lowers HAM-A scores. It is concluded that severity of anxiety significantly worsens the phenomenology of MAFD. Therefore, treatments of MAFD should target increased severity of anxiety and its risk factors including low HDL-cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, childhood trauma and tobacco use disorder."
"Cryopreservation of sperm from the coral Acropora humilis  2017 Elsevier Inc.Corals are sensitive to minute changes in their environments, and their continued existence is substantially threatened by the increasing number of destructive anthropogenic activities and unprecedented rates of climate change. Although cryopreservation has been successfully to preserve mammalian gametes for decades, coral cryopreservation was attempted for the first time less than 15 years ago, and freezing protocols exist for only a handful of coral species. The present study developed a cryopreservation protocol for the sperm of the common Indo-Pacific reef-builder Acropora humilis. Colonies of reefs of Sattahip Bay, Chonburi Province, Thailand were collected from 3 m depth with a mesh net during a spawning event. Immediately after collection, the sperm were isolated and subjected to a two-step freezing method featuring DMSO, polyethylene glycol, or methanol as the cryoprotectant. Viability and motility were assessed via a bioluminescence technique and a “computer-assisted semen analysis, and it was found that a 15-min equilibration with 2 M DMSO followed by cooling at 41.7 °C was the optimum cryopreservation protocol for A. humilis sperm. The post-thaw sperm achieved 45% fertilization success, and 35% of the fertilized eggs developed into blastopore larvae. The present optimized protocol can therefore facilitate the preservation of sperm for future propagation efforts of this species and provide an experimental platform for optimizing cryopreservation protocols for gametes of other scleractinian coral species."
"Factors contributing to managerial competence of first-line nurse managers: A systematic review  2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdAims: To determine the factors contributing to managerial competence of first-line nurse managers. Background: Understanding factors affecting managerial competence of nurse managers remains important to increase the performance of organizations; however, there is sparse research examining factors that influence managerial competence of first-line nurse managers. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: The search strategy was conducted from April to July 2017 that included 6 electronic databases: Science Direct, PROQUEST Dissertations and Theses, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for the years 2000 to 2017 with full text in English. Quantitative and qualitative research papers that examined relationships among managerial competence and antecedent factors were included. Review methods: Quality assessment, data extractions, and analysis were completed on all included studies. Content analysis was used to categorize factors into themes. Results: Eighteen influencing factors were examined and categorized into 3 themes—organizational factors, characteristics and personality traits of individual managers, and role factors. Conclusion: Findings suggest that managerial competence of first-line nurse managers is multifactorial. Further research is needed to develop strategies to develop managerial competence of first-line nurse managers."
"Epidemiology of head and neck cancer in Thailand  2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdCancer is the most common cause of death in Thailand, with the mortality almost doubled during 1998–2011 (from 48.4 to 95.2 per 100 000). The estimated number of new cancer cases in 2011 was 112 392. Our review provides baseline data on the current epidemiological situation with head and neck (HN) cancer in Thailand based on reports of the National Cancer Registry and findings from local and international publications. Collectively, HN cancer approaches age-standardized rate (ASR) incidence of 15.7 and 10.7 per 100 000 males and females, respectively, and is ranked among the top five dominant cancers in Thailand. The leading HN malignancies in men are oral (ASR incidence 4.6 per 100 000), nasopharyngeal (ASR 2.8) and laryngeal (ASR 2.7) cancers, while the most common cancers in women are thyroid (ASR 5.1) and oral (ASR 3.2) carcinomas. Some local habits (betel quid chewing, traditional cigarette smoking and alcohol intake) are associated with the high incidence of oral cancer in Northeast Thailand. Despite important prognostic significance, the role of human papillomavirus infection in various HN cancers from Thailand has been scarcely addressed. There is a growing incidence of thyroid cancer over the last two decades. The Thai population overall, compared to worldwide rates of HN malignancies, has a lower incidence of laryngeal and thyroid cancers but higher incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer."
"Paper-based amperometric sensor for determination of acetylcholinesterase using screen-printed graphene electrode  2017 Elsevier B.V.A simple paper-based sensor with electrochemical detection was first developed for rapid, selective, and sensitive determination of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The screen-printed graphene electrode was used as working electrode providing sensitivity for the sensor. The amperometric detection of AChE is based on the determination of thiocholine (TCh) produced from hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCh) by AChE. To detect TCh, the ATCh immobilized sheet was stacked onto the detection sheet using double adhesive tape, then samples of AChE were dropped on the back side of an ATCh immobilized sheet with only 1 min of incubation time. To avoid interference, glutathione (GSH), the potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied onto a graphene electrode and the current, which depends on AChE concentration, was measured. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) from the experiment of AChE determination was 0.1 U/mL with AChE concentration in range of 0.1–15 U/mL. The data correlated well with the data obtained using spectrophotometric method. The developed sensor had been successfully applied to detect AChE in blood samples."
"Cysteamine-capped copper nanoclusters as a highly selective turn-on fluorescent assay for the detection of aluminum ions  2017 Elsevier B.V.A new type of copper nanoclusters was synthesized by a one-pot reaction using cysteamine as a capping agent and reducing agent (Cys-CuNCs). The synthesized CuNCs exhibited a spherical shape and a monodisperse and strong fluorescent emission characteristic peak at 430 nm when exciting at 330 nm. The Cys-CuNCs were demonstrated as a fluorescent chemodosimeter for the selective detection of Al3+. In the presence of Al3+, the fluorescent emission of the Cys-CuNCs was considerably enhanced, while other studied metal ions did not show this phenomenon. The fluorescent intensity near 380 nm linearly increased with an increasing Al3+ concentration. The proposed method provided a working range of 1–7 µM with a low detection limit of 26.7 nM and was applied to determine Al3+ in drinking water samples with satisfactory results."
"Lipid Peroxidation and Immune Biomarkers Are Associated with Major Depression and Its Phenotypes, Including Treatment-Resistant Depression and Melancholia  2017, The Author(s).To examine immune-inflammatory and oxidative (I&O) biomarkers in major depression (MDD) and its related phenotypes, we recruited 114 well-phenotyped depressed patients and 50 healthy controls and measured serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1α, soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA), soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 60 and 80 kDa (sTNF-R1/R2), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Obtained results indicate that MDD is characterized by increased sIL-1RA, sTNF-R1, and TBARS concentrations. Melancholic depression is associated with increased sIL-6R but lowered IL-1α levels. A current episode of depression is accompanied by significantly increased sIL-6R compared to the remitted state. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is accompanied by increased sIL-6R and TBARS but lowered sTNF-R2 levels compared to non-TRD patients. These immune markers are not significantly correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), number episodes, or age at onset. Our findings show that increased sIL-1RA, sTNF-R1, and TBARS levels may be trait markers of depression, while increased sIL-6R levels may be a state marker of melancholia and an acute phase of depression. MDD is accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation and simultaneous activation of immune pathways, and the compensatory anti-inflammatory reflex system (CIRS). TRD is characterized by highly increased oxidative stress and probably increased TNFα and IL-6 trans-signalling. Novel treatments for major depression should target oxidative stress pathways, while new treatments for TRD should primary target lipid peroxidation and also activated immune-inflammatory pathways."
"Microstructures and photocatalytic properties of ZnO films fabricated by Zn electrodeposition and heat treatment  2017 Elsevier LtdNanostructured zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were synthesized via an electrodeposition and subsequent heat treatment method. Using the annealing temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 600 °C, the films develop a variation of microstructures of distinct properties and characteristics. Photocatalytic activities of the ZnO films were studied from photodegradation of methylene blue dye under UV light. Overall, the ZnO films show good photodegradation efficiency and photostabilization. The ZnO film fabricated at 500 °C particularly exhibits relatively high surface area and the strongest photocatalytic activity, which is fairly stable after successive reaction cycles."
"Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis  2017 Elsevier B.V.Background Predictor analyses of late-life depression can be used to identify variables associated with outcomes of treatments, and hence ways of tailoring specific treatments to patients. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review and meta-analyse predictors of outcomes of any type of treatment for late-life depression. Methods Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to December 2016. Primary and secondary studies reported treatment predictors from randomised controlled trials of any treatment for patients with major depressive disorder aged over 60 were included. Treatment outcomes included response, remission and change in depression score. Results Sixty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 65 identified statistically significant predictors, only 7 were reported in at least 3 studies. Of these, 5 were included in meta-analyses, and only 3 were statistically significant. Most studies were rated as being of moderate to strong quality and satisfied key quality criteria for predictor analyses. Limitations The searches were limited to randomised controlled trials and most of the included studies were secondary analyses. Conclusions Baseline depression severity, co-morbid anxiety, executive dysfunction, current episode duration, early improvement, physical illnesses and age were reported as statistically significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Only the first three were significant in meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed differences in predictor effect between biological and psychosocial treatment. However, high heterogeneity and small study numbers suggest a cautious interpretation of results. These predictors were associated with various mechanisms including brain pathophysiology, perceived social support and proposed distinct types of depressive disorder. Further investigation of the clinical utility of these predictors is suggested."
"Effects of thermal annealing on microstructure and magnetic properties of electrodeposited Co-Fe alloys  2017 Elsevier LtdThermal annealing could potentially serve as important instrument for controlling and improving the properties of the soft magnetic films. A systematic investigation is carried out in this study to determine and analyze the effects of low-temperature heat treatment on the microstructure and magnetic properties of CoFe films of different chemical compositions. The coercivity of the alloys is found to be critically influenced by surface roughness and uniaxial anisotropy, which is in turn affected by thermal annealing. The saturation magnetization on the other hand is controlled mainly by chemical compositions."
"Utilization of hexabromoacetone for protection of alcohols and aldehydes and deprotection of acetals, ketals, and oximes under UV irradiation  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.Hexabromoacetone (HBA) was efficiently used for the protection of alcohols and aldehydes and deprotection of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal, solketal, and other acetals and ketals. In only 10 min, the protection of glycerol yielded 90% of solketal and protection of benzaldehyde gave 95% of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal. The deprotection of benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal under UV irradiation gave over 90% yield of benzaldehyde within 15 s using only 2.5 mol% of HBA. HBA was also successfully used for deoximation. Solvent was found to play an important role in the efficiency of HBA for these reactions."
"Antihistamines for treating rhinosinusitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled studies Copyright  JLO (1984) Limited 2017.Background: Without the release of histamines, patients with rhinosinusitis may not benefit from antihistamines. Additionally, anticholinergic effects may do more harm than good. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of antihistamines in treating rhinosinusitis. Methods: An electronic search was performed. Randomised controlled trials comparing antihistamines with either placebo or other treatments for patients with rhinosinusitis were selected. Results: Two studies (184 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Loratadine decreased nasal obstruction in allergic rhinitis patients with acute rhinosinusitis (mean difference = -0.58; confidence interval = -0.85 to -0.31, p < 0.01), but had no benefit on total symptom score (mean difference = -1.25; confidence interval = -2.77 to 0.27, p = 0.11), or rhinorrhoea symptoms (mean difference = -0.06; confidence interval = -0.37 to 0.25, p = 0.71). Conclusion: There is limited evidence to support the use of antihistamines in treating rhinosinusitis. The number of included studies in this systematic review is limited. Antihistamines may relieve nasal obstruction in allergic rhinitis patients with acute rhinosinusitis."
"Oral fluid samples used for PRRSV acclimatization program and sow performance monitoring in endemic PRRS-positive farms  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.An effective gilt acclimatization program is one of the most important management strategies for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection. Recently, oral fluid samples have been used as alternative diagnostic samples for various swine diseases. This study utilized oral fluids for PRRSV monitoring during the gilt acclimatization period in PRRSV endemic farms. The study was performed in two selected commercial breeding herds (farm A and farm B). PRRSV RNA and PRRSV-specific antibodies were monitored using oral fluid and serum samples. Sow performance parameters related to PRRSV infection were recorded and assessed. After PRRSV exposure during acclimatization, viral RNA was demonstrated in oral fluids from 1 to 10 weeks post-exposure (WPE). PRRSV RNA was detected in serum at 1 and 4 WPE in farm A and at 1, 4, 8, and 12 WPE in farm B. Prolonged viremia of gilts from farm B was possibly due to re-infection (within the herd) and later, reproductive problems were found in the breeding herd. The correlation of PRRSV RNA concentration in oral fluids and serum was evident. The S/P ratio values of PRRSV antibodies in oral fluid samples were higher and had similar patterns of antibody responses to the serum samples. The results suggest that the use of oral fluid samples for PRRSV monitoring during gilt acclimatization in endemic farms is effective, convenient, practical, and economical and would be most beneficial when used with other parameters."
"3-D MDT with spherical targets by bilinear interpolation for determining blood velocity profiles including the vessel wall effect  2017 Elsevier B.V.A numerical simulation of three-dimensional (3-D) implant assisted-magnetic drug targeting (IA-MDT) using ferromagnetic spherical targets, including the effect from the vessel wall on the blood flow, is presented. The targets were implanted within arterioles and subjected to an externally uniform applied magnetic field in order to increase the effectiveness of targeting magnetic drug carrier particles (MDCPs). The capture area (As) of the MDCPs was determined by inspection of the particle trajectories simulated from the particle equations of motion. The blood flow velocities at any particle position around the target were obtained by applying bilinear interpolation to the numerical blood velocity data. The effects on As of the type of ferromagnetic materials in the targets and MDCPs, average blood flow rates, mass fraction of the ferromagnetic material in the MDCPs, average radii of MDCPs (Rp) and the externally applied magnetic field strength (μ0H0) were evaluated. Furthermore, the appropriate μ0H0 and Rp for the IA-MDT design is suggested. In the case of the SS409 target and magnetite MDCPs, dimensionless capture areas ranging from 4.1- to 12.4 and corresponding to particle capture efficiencies of 31–94% were obtained with Rp ranging from 100- to 500 nm, weight fraction of 80%, μ0H0 of 0.6 T and an average blood flow rate of 0.01 ms−1. In addition, the more general 3-D modelling of IA-MDT in this work is applicable to IA-MDT using spherical targets implanted within blood vessels for both laminar and potential blood flows including the wall effect."
"Alternative microalgal diets for cultivation of the fairy shrimp Branchinella thailandensis (Branchiopoda: Anostraca)  2017, Springer International Publishing AG.Fairy shrimp is known as a nutritional food for fish and crustaceans in aquaculture. In most hatcheries, the microalga Chlorella sp. appears to be the most common, suitable, and nutritious food to feed fairy shrimp. In this study, we attempted to determine other alternative algal diets for cultivation of fairy shrimp Branchinella thailandensis. Seven experimental diets including three treatments of dried Spirulina sp. at 0.75 (S1), 1.5 (S2), and 3.0 mg dry weight individual−1 (S3); three treatments of Chlorococcum humicola at 5 × 105 (Ch1), 1 × 106 (Ch2), and 2 × 106 cells mL−1 (Ch3); and a control diet (Chlorella vulgaris at 1 × 106 cells mL−1) were fed to 5-day-old shrimp for 15 days. Evaluation of growth performance, egg production, survival percentage, and nutritional and carotenoid content of the experimental fairy shrimp revealed that Ch3 is the most suitable algal diet. Our results suggest that C. humicola is the best alternative food source for the cultivation of B. thailandensis. In addition, dried Spirulina powder is also a good choice when live algae are not available and can be used as an alternative feed in fairy shrimp cultures."
"Simple and selective paper-based colorimetric sensor for determination of chloride ion in environmental samples using label-free silver nanoprisms  2017 Elsevier B.V.Simple and selective paper-based colorimetric sensors using silver nanoprism (AgNPrs) were conveniently fabricated and developed for the determination of chloride ions (Cl−) contaminated in the environment. Samples containing different concentrations of Cl− were analyzed. The analysis is based on the oxidative etching of the AgNPrs into smaller silver nanospheres (AgNPss) by Cl−. In the presence of Cl−, the distinctive color change of the AgNPrs from dark-violet to red was rapidly visualized by the naked eye in 5 min without the requirement of surface modification. For quantitative measurement using image processing, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.996) between logarithmic of Cl− concentration and the average mean color intensity was obtained in the range of 10–1000 mg L−1 with a detection limit of 1.3 mg L−1. The developed sensors were investigated for precision, accuracy, and sensitivity and validated by the classical method. Statistical analysis proved that the developed sensors were precise, sensitive and accurate and can be used effectively for the analysis of Cl− in natural waters."
"Transcriptome-based discovery of pathways and genes related to reproduction of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon)  2017 Elsevier B.V.The black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) is an aquatic animal with considerable economic importance. Poor reproductive maturation in captivity impedes sustainable aquaculture production of this species. This study aims to provide transcriptomic information on reproductive organs using 454 pyrosequencing technology. The transcriptome analysis of ovaries and testes revealed 41,136 transcripts with 20,192 contigs. We found novel sets of transcripts completing several important reproductive pathways such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. In addition, we found transcripts encoding for receptors crucial for initiation of the maturation process, such as GnRH receptor (GnRHR), voltage-dependent calcium channel L type alpha-1C (CACNA1C) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Moreover, we found a putative novel vigillin encoding for an estrogen–induced polysome-associated protein, which has not been reported in penaeid shrimp. These results suggest that the regulatory mechanism of the pathways important to reproductive maturation might be similar to those in the vertebrate. The obtained data will consequently accelerate the study of reproductive biology of this important species to ensure a sustainable shrimp farming industry."
"In-process prediction of roundness based on dynamic cutting forces  2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.This paper describes a development of in-process prediction of roundness from the previous research of the author in CNC turning process. The relations of roundness, dynamic cutting forces, and cutting conditions have been investigated. In order to eliminate the effects of the cutting conditions, the dynamic cutting forces are dimensionless by taking the ratio of the average variations of dynamic radial force to that of the dynamic feed force. The exponential function is employed for the sake to model the in-process prediction of roundness which consists of cutting speeds, feed rates, depths of cut, tool nose radiuses, rake angles, and dynamic cutting force ratio. The experimentally obtained results showed that the better roundness errors can be obtained by increasing the cutting speed, the tool nose radius, and the rake angle. The new cutting tests have been conducted to verify the obtained model. It is understood that the in-process roundness can be predicted well during cutting with the high accuracy by using the proposed method."
"Decomposing the complete graph and the complete graph minus a 1-factor into copies of a graph G where G is the union of two disjoint cycles  2017 Elsevier LtdLet G of order n be the vertex-disjoint union of two cycles. It is known that there exists a G-decomposition of Kv for all v≡1(mod2n). If G is bipartite and x is a positive integer, it is also known that there exists a G-decomposition of Knx−I, where I is a 1-factor. If G is not bipartite, there exists a G-decomposition of Kn if n is odd, and of Kn−I, where I is a 1-factor, if n is even. We use novel extensions of the Bose construction for Steiner triple systems and some recent results on the Oberwolfach Problem to obtain a G-decomposition of Kv for all v≡n(mod2n) when n is odd, unless G=C4∪C5 and v=9. If G consists of two odd cycles and n≡0(mod4), we also obtain a G-decomposition of Kv−I, for all v≡0(modn), v≠4n."
"Structure and electronic properties of deformed single-walled carbon nanotubes: quantum calculations  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.The electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can be modified by deforming their structure under high pressure. The aim of this study was to use quantum calculations to investigate one such property, the energy band gap, in relation to molecular structures of armchair and zigzag SWCNTs of various sizes and shapes deformed by applied forces. To model the increase in pressure, the degree of flatness (η) of the SWCNTs was adjusted as the primary parameter. The calculations gave accurate C-C bond lengths of the SWCNTs in their distorted states; these distortions significantly affected the electronic properties, especially the energy band gap of the SWCNTs. These results may contribute to a more refined design of new nano-electronic devices."
"Outcome of dilatation and predictors of failed dilatation in patients with acid-induced corrosive esophageal strictures  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Outcome of endoscopic dilatation in acid-induced corrosive esophageal stricture is less known. This study aims to determine the outcome of dilatation and predictors of failed dilatation in patients with acid-induced corrosive esophageal stricture. Patients diagnosed of corrosive esophageal strictures were included. Endoscopic dilatation with graded Savary-Gilliard dilator was performed as the first line treatment. Outcome of dilatation was considered favorable when patients were able to swallow solid without intervention at least six months after successful dilatation. Failure of dilatation was defined as one of the following; complete luminal stenosis, inability to perform safe dilatation, perforation, and inability to maintain adequate luminal patency. Surgery or repeated dilatation was indicated in failed dilatations. There were 55 patients with corrosive esophageal strictures. Of 55 patients, 41 (75%) had failed dilatation (38 having esophageal replacement procedure, two continue repeated dilatation and one unfit for surgery). Of 323 sessions of dilatations, eight out of 55 patients (14.5%) had perforations. There was no dilatation-related mortality. Patients with concomitant pharyngeal stricture (p = 0.0001), long (≥ 10 cm) stricture length (p < 0.0001), number of dilatation >6 sessions per year (p = 0.01) and refractory stricture (inability to pass a larger than 11 mm dilator within three sessions) (p = 0.01) were more likely to have failed dilatation. Thirty-two of 38 patients with surgery had good swallow outcome with one operative mortality (2.6%). At the median follow-up of 61 months, overall favorable outcome was 84% after surgery and 25% for dilatation (p < 0.0001). Majority of patients with acid-induced corrosive esophageal stricture were refractory to dilatation. Esophageal dilatations were ultimately failed in three-fourth of the patients. Concomitant cricopharyngeal stricture, long stricture length, requiring frequent dilatation, and refractory to >11 mm dilatation were factors associated with failed dilatation."
"In vivo exfoliating efficacy of biodegradable beads and the correlation with user's satisfaction  2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background/purpose: By the end of 2017, non-biodegradable microbeads will be prohibited in USA, UK and Europe, due to their environmental issue. There are biodegradable beads available, but their effect on skin desquamation has not been evaluated yet. This study aimed to understand the skin renewal time, moisturizing effect and user's satisfaction of gel scrubs containing different exfoliating beads. Methods: Gel scrubs, containing polyethylene, mannan or wax beads, were used in this study. The stratum corneum turnover time (SCTT) and skin hydration were evaluated by dansyl chloride staining technique and Corneometer®, respectively. The self-assessment was also performed after a 3-week home use trial. Results: The SCTTs of three different gel scrubs were not significantly different. A numerical increase in the skin hydration level was found in all groups. Satisfaction scores for the appearance and usability attributes were similar, but scores for improvement in the skin hydration and skin smoothness were higher in the gel scrubs with mannan or wax beads. Conclusion: All three gel scrubs provided a similar effect on the SCTT and skin hydration, but gel scrubs with mannan or wax beads were more favorable. Thus, these two biodegradable exfoliating beads may be good substitutes in scrubbing products."
"An improvement of silk-based scaffold properties using collagen type I for skin tissue engineering applications  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Silk has been intensively studied for tissue engineering applications owning to its advantages of biodegradability, tunable mechanical properties, versatile processing, and biocompatibility. Silk, however, has few cell signaling domains, so silk alone might not be sufficient to use as the scaffolds for tissue engineering. Here, we demonstrated the improvement of silk scaffold properties by the incorporation of type I collagen [Col; 0, 3.61, 7.69, 14.89, and 50% (w/w)] into silk-based scaffolds. The morphology and properties, including biocompatibility, of the scaffolds were then investigated. Notably, moderate amounts of Col (7.69 and 14.89%) improved fibroblast attachment and supported proliferation on the scaffolds compared to those of silk alone. Both 7.69 and 14.89% Col scaffolds exhibited more organized and smaller pore sizes (144.09 ± 25.97 and 140.67 ± 38.28 μm in diameter, respectively) with thinner walls compared to higher silk content (0 and 3.61% Col) scaffolds. The 7.69 and 14.89% Col also improved the scaffold stability over 21 days, whereas silk alone scaffolds dramatically lost their weight by day 21. The incorporation of collagen also increased water adsorption ability of the scaffolds. Therefore, this study demonstrated the effects of type I collagen toward improving the properties of silk-based scaffolds."
"Bifunctional activity of fused Plasmodium falciparum orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase  2017 Elsevier B.V.Fusion of the last two enzymes in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in the inversed order by having a COOH-terminal orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and an NH2-terminal orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC), as OMPDC-OPRT, are described in many organisms. Here, we produced gene fusions of Plasmodium falciparum OMPDC-OPRT and expressed the bifunctional protein in Escherichia coli. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity using affinity and anion-exchange chromatography, exhibited enzymatic activities and functioned as a dimer. The activities, although unstable, were stabilized by its substrate and product during purification and long-term storage. Furthermore, the enzyme expressed a perfect catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). The kcat was selectively enhanced up to three orders of magnitude, while the Km was not much affected and remained at low μM levels when compared to the monofunctional enzymes. The fusion of the two enzymes, creating a “super-enzyme” with perfect catalytic power and more flexibility, reflects cryptic relationship of enzymatic reactivities and metabolic functions on molecular evolution."
"The first detection of Senecavirus A in pigs in Thailand, 2016  2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbHWe report the first detection of Senecavirus A (SVA) in nine of 12 (75%) pigs in Thailand in 2016. The full-length genome demonstrated that Thai SVA isolates were closely related to the first Canada strain (11-55910-3) than the recent strains causing outbreaks in Brazil, the United States and China in 2015–2016."
"Examining relationships between socio-demographics and self-efficacy among registered nurses in Australia  2017 Australian College of Nursing LtdBackground: Self-efficacy in nursing is the nurses’ perception of their abilities to show caring orientations, attitudes, and behaviours and to develop caring relationships with patients. Self-efficacy is associated with years of experience, higher levels of job satisfaction and changes to nursing practices that conform with best practice. There is currently a paucity of evidence and no Australian studies were found examining the relationships between socio-demographic variables and self-efficacy in Australian nurses. Aim: The aim of this study was to examine if relationships existed between the socio-demographic variables, years of experience, age, gender, marital status, level of education, years employed in the same workplace, employment status, geographical location, specialty area, health sector and Australian state and the perceived self-efficacy of Australian registered nurses. Research: Design Cross-sectional survey of Australian registered nurses. Methods: A stratified random sample of registered nurses was drawn from the database of a national industrial and professional organisation. The Caring Efficacy Scale (CES) was categorised into quartiles, and bivariate and multivariable relationships were examined using ordinal logistic regression. Results: The proportion of nurses reporting low caring efficacy scores tended to decrease with years of experience and was lower in nurses who have been married. After adjustment in the final multivariable model, marital status and years of experience remained significantly related to caring efficacy (p < 0.05). Conclusion: A relationship exists between years of nursing experience, marital status and perceived self-efficacy among Australian registered nurses who belonged to an industrial and professional organisation. Targeted professional development programmes that support the improvement of perceived self-efficacy of all levels of nurses, might improve nurses’ confidences and abilities to develop caring relationships with patients."
"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in South East Asia: An analysis of the histopathology, clinical features, and survival from Thailand Copyright  2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Systemic reports on the descriptive epidemiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) from Southeast Asia are scarce. A nationwide multi-institutional registry was conducted to compare the histopathology, clinical features, and survival of Thai adult patients with NHL using large registries, especially those from Far East Asia (FEA). Using a web-based registry system, 13 major medical centers from the 4 geographic regions of Thailand prospectively collected, from 2007 to 2014, the diagnostic pathology, according to the World Health Organization classification, 2008, clinical features and survival of 4056 patients who were newly diagnosed with NHL. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range, 16-99 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.3:1. From the total of 4056 patients, T/NK-cell lymphoma (TNKCL) accounted for 12.6% of cases, and 5.1% had human immunodeficiency virus–associated lymphoma. The four leading histological subtypes were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (58.1%); follicular lymphoma (5.6%); extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (5.2%); and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (4.0%). With a median follow-up duration of 46.1 months, the median overall survival of B-cell NHL was significantly longer than that of patients with TNKCL (76.5 vs 28.8 months, P =.0001). Compared to FEA, the Thai registry had an approximately one-half lower relative frequency of TNKCL; the prevalence of extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma was much lower than in Korea, and the frequency of extranodal TNKCL, nasal type, was strikingly low compared to China. It is concluded that while the median age of Thai patients with NHL was approximately a decade younger than for Caucasians, the long-term survival rates for most histological subtypes were comparable. While the histological distribution generally complied with the characteristic Asian features, some differences from FEA were observed."
"Effects of landscape cover and local habitat characteristics on visiting bees in tropical orchards  2017 The Royal Entomological Society.Global population declines of insect pollinators highlight the need for a greater ecological understanding of the responses of wild pollinators to local management actions and to human alterations of landscapes, especially in the tropics where crops are highly dependent on wild pollinators. We examined the effects of local and landscape factors on the richness and abundance of bees in farms around Bangkok, Thailand. Bee communities in 24 mango (Mangifera indica L.) orchards in heavily modified landscapes (61–99% anthropogenic land cover) were compared. We predicted that bees would be more species rich in orchards with higher flower diversity, whereas small-sized bees with non-eusocial and/or below-ground nesting habits would be more sensitive to human disturbance, and hence rare. Twenty-eight species were caught and individuals of genus Apis comprised >92% of 3842 bees sampled and dominated all 24 sites. Habitat effects on bee richness and abundance were stronger at the farm scale than at the landscape scale. At the farm scale, total bee richness and abundance, as well as small, non-eusocial and below-ground nesting bee richness and abundance, were negatively associated with field size and positively associated with flowering plant diversity. The percentage of urban land cover within a 1-km radius was weakly but positively related to total bee richness and small-sized bee richness; total bee abundance was positively associated with wetland cover. A greater diversity of flowering plants retained in smaller fields maintained higher bee richness and abundances, particularly small-sized bees. Farmers can enhance bee populations by maintaining small patches of flowers in their fields."
"Using urine as a biomarker in human exposure risk associated with arsenic and other heavy metals contaminating drinking groundwater in intensively agricultural areas of Thailand  2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.Urine used as a biomarker was collected and compared between two groups of participants: (1) a groundwater-drinking group and (2) a non-groundwater-drinking group in intensively agricultural areas in Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand. The statistical relationship with the metal concentration in shallow groundwater wells was established with urine data. According to the groundwater data, the health risk assessment results for four metals appeared to be higher for participants who drank groundwater than for the other group. The carcinogenic risk and non-carcinogenic risk of arsenic (As) were found in 25.86 and 31.03% of participants, respectively. For lead (Pb), 13.79% of the participants had a non-carcinogenic risk. Moreover, 30 of the 58 participants in the groundwater-drinking group had As urine higher than the standard, and 26, 2 and 9 of the 58 participants had above-standard levels for cadmium (Cd), Pb and mercury (Hg) in urine, respectively. Both the risk assessment and biomarker level of groundwater-drinking participants were higher than in the other group. The results showed an average drinking rate of approximately 4.21 ± 2.73 L/day, which is twice as high as the standard. Interestingly, the As levels in the groundwater correlated with those in the urine of the groundwater-drinking participants, but not in the non-groundwater-drinking participants, as well as with the As-related cancer and non-carcinogenic risks. The hazard index (HI) of the 100 participants ranged from 0.00 to 25.86, with an average of 1.51 ± 3.63 higher than the acceptable level, revealing that 28 people appeared to have non-carcinogenic risk levels (24 and 4 people for groundwater-drinking participants and non-groundwater-drinking participants, respectively). Finally, the associated factors of heavy metals in urine were the drinking water source, body weight, smoking, sex and use of personal protective equipment."
"Deficit, but Not Nondeficit, Schizophrenia Is Characterized by Mucosa-Associated Activation of the Tryptophan Catabolite (TRYCAT) Pathway with Highly Specific Increases in IgA Responses Directed to Picolinic, Xanthurenic, and Quinolinic Acid  2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Evidence suggests that activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, no previous study examined whether TRYCAT pathway activation is associated with deficit schizophrenia. We measured IgA responses to TRYCATs, namely quinolinic acid, picolinic acid, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, and anthranilic acid and 3-OH-kynurenine, in 40 healthy controls and in schizophrenic patients with (n = 40) and without (n = 40) deficit, defined according to the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS). Primary deficit schizophrenia is accompanied by an activated TRYCAT pathway as compared to controls and nondeficit schizophrenia. Participants with deficit schizophrenia show increased IgA responses to xanthurenic acid, picolinic acid, and quinolinic acid and relatively lowered IgA responses to kynurenic and anthranilic acids, as compared to patients with nondeficit schizophrenia. Both schizophrenia subgroups show increased IgA responses to 3-OH-kynurenine as compared to controls. The IgA responses to noxious TRYCATs, namely xanthurenic acid, picolinic acid, quinolinic acid, and 3-OH-kynurenine, but not protective TRYCATS, namely anthranilic acid and kunyrenic acid, are significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia than in controls. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are significantly and positively associated with increased IgA responses directed against picolinic acid and inversely with anthranilic acid, whereas no significant associations between positive symptoms and IgA responses to TRYCATs were found. In conclusion, primary deficit schizophrenia is characterized by TRYCAT pathway activation and differs from nondeficit schizophrenia by a highly specific TRYCAT pattern suggesting increased excitotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, as well as inflammation and oxidative stress. The specific alterations in IgA responses to TRYCATs provide further insight for the biological delineation of deficit versus nondeficit schizophrenia."
"Roles and competences for educators of undergraduate dental students: a discussion paper  2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: Dental educators are important people who contribute to the development of every aspect of dental education. In part due to the lack of understanding of their roles and competences, dental educator development has so far received little consideration. With the aim of enhancing the dental profession's contribution to the development of undergraduate dental education, this article explores common roles of educators of undergraduate dental students and the competences needed to be effective educators. Methods: This is a discussion paper based on a wide reading of the literature on the education of health professionals with a specific focus on roles and competences of educators. Results and discussion: Roles of educators of undergraduate dental students typically encompass four areas: teaching, research, administration and providing healthcare. Educators may not be involved in every role; they normally perform the roles relevant to their work contexts. Competences for dental educators based on the four main roles comprise 12 domains: educational theories and principles; modes of education; learner issues; educational materials and instructional design; assessment and feedback; curriculum matters; evaluation; educational research; educational management; quality assurance; patient care and healthcare system and professionalism. Not all competences are required by all educators although educators need to be competent in the areas related to their roles and duties. Conclusion: Understanding the roles and competences for educators of undergraduate dental students can help individual educators to improve their personal effectiveness and institutions to tailor staff development programmes appropriate to the needs of their staff. Faculty development contributes to sustained enhancement of undergraduate dental education."
"Cost-benefit analysis of shrimp farming's flood risk reduction strategies in Thailand  2016 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons LtdChachoengsao province is a prime shrimp producing area for domestic consumption and exports. The province, however, is often threatened by floods. Improving the effectiveness of current flood damage protection is a major challenge. This research developed a flood risk map by combining the probability of flood events and a vulnerability map based on physical characteristics of the area and socio-economic conditions of shrimp farmers (victims). Analysis of current risk reduction measures was performed by comparing the net benefits and costs of different strategies. Damage costs to shrimp farming from flooding were also estimated for the base case (a case with no change in actions). The flood risk map shows that two-thirds of shrimp farms are highly vulnerable to flooding when a 10-day accumulated rainfall is greater than 250 mm which is likely to occur every 2 years. Increasing dike heights could yield higher net benefits than other flood adaptation measures. Non-structural flood controls such as early harvesting and shifting the crop calendar are alternative measures for shrimp farmers who lack financial supports. The results show that cost-benefit analysis based on various scenarios can help in selecting an appropriate mitigation practice especially for shrimp farms located in a high risk area."
"Competence, competency-based education, and undergraduate dental education: a discussion paper  2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: The aim of undergraduate dental education is to provide competent dentists to serve societal needs and improve population oral healthcare. Competency-based education has influenced the development of dental education for decades but this term is problematic. This article explores components of competency-based undergraduate health professional education in order to help the dental profession have a better understanding of the context and purposes of undergraduate dental education. Methods: This is a discussion paper based on a wide reading of the literature on the education of health professionals with a specific focus on competency-based undergraduate education. Results and Discussion: Competence comprises an integration of knowledge, skills and attitudes indicating a capability to perform professional tasks safely and ethically. The process of becoming a competent practitioner is complex. Four characteristics of competency-based education are: curriculum components and content shaped by societal needs; focused on student-centred learning; learning achievement; and limited attention to time-based training and numerical targets. Alongside a competency-based approach, undergraduate dental education can be influenced by institutional features and external factors but these receive little consideration in the literature. Conclusion: Understanding competence, competency-based education, and institutional and external factors will help to improve educational quality, define roles and professional development for the dental educator, and inform further research."
"Cumulative radiation exposure and estimated lifetime cancer risk in multiple-injury adult patients undergoing repeated or multiple CTs  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Purpose: To estimate the cumulative radiation exposure and lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of radiation-induced cancer from computed tomographic (CT) scanning of adult patients with multiple-injury traumas. Methods: The study comprises 328 multiple-injury adult patients who underwent diagnostic CT during 2013. Each patient’s cumulative CT radiation exposure was calculated and the biological effects of ionizing radiation VII methodology was used to estimate the LAR of cancer incidence on the basis of sex and age at each exposure. Results: The average cumulative dose per patient was 19.4 mSv. One point five percent (5/328) of the patients received a cumulative effective dose ≥100 mSv and 63.7 % of patients received a cumulative effective dose ≤20 mSv. The average LAR of cancer incidence was 0.14 % or 1 in 714 patients. Only one patient had an LAR >1 %, a man <30 years of age. The group of major injuries [injury severity score (ISS) >15] had a statistically significantly greater accumulative effective dose and slightly greater LAR than the group of minor injuries (ISS ≤15). Conclusions: More than half of the multiple-injury trauma patients were classified as low risk cumulative effective dose (≤20 mSv) and almost all patients had a low LAR risk of cancer incidence from CT studies. Patients who were at the highest risk of cancer from CT scans were those aged under 30 years who had multiple or repeated scans, particularly in the trunk."
"Improving reliability of synchrophasor data gathering method using network coding technique  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.We consider synchrophasor data gathering method over the network of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) applications. Although this network plays an important role to monitor, protect and control distribution electric grid, the research efforts in efficient data collection method are lacking in the literature. In this paper, we represent a novel data gathering approach using Network Coding technique and develop a mathematic model to predict the PMUs network reliability using our proposed model. It allows the PMU nodes in network to perform linear combination of many packets in order to improve the packet delivering ratio at the collector. We demonstrate our proposed method using a distribution grid test case and evaluate the performance by using Monter Carlo simulation. The numerical results have verified the effectiveness of our proposed method."
"Groundwater and river interaction parameter estimation in saigon river, Vietnam  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The Saigon River system is one of the largest resources contributing water supply for domestic and industrial fields in the Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong Province where the drought issue is occurring at downstream area in recent years [1]. To manage the water resources in Saigon Basin effectively, the groundwater and river interaction parameter needs to be assessed systematically. However, in the past researches, the parameters seem to be less described with full understandings. In this study, a groundwater modeling of the main stream of Saigon River was applied to analyze groundwater and river interaction parameter along the river. The interaction layer was defined as a combined layer by materials of riverbed and materials of aquitard or aquifer. The values of conductance, through groundwater model calibration by piezometric heads during 2000 to 2007 at three cross-sections in Saigon River, were used to estimate the interaction parameter (KiM-1) at correlative cross-section. A function of interaction parameter with ratio of wetted length (Rw) was developed to estimate interaction parameter at each cross-section along Saigon River. When river cross-sections has no penetration to the aquifer and the materials of interaction layer consists of materials of riverbed and aquitard, the value of interactions is equal to 0.0003 d-1. In the other hand, the value will be reach to 0.254 d-1 when river cross-section has fully penetration to the aquifer. The interaction parameter function developed was applied to investigate the flow in and out between river and aquifer in the study area. In the upper part of Saigon River, river gained water from inflow of groundwater through riverbed (river gain) and lost water to groundwater (river loss) by outflow through the riverbed in the lower part during 2000 to 2007 and the river recharge to the first aquifer supplies to the second aquifer to supplement the aquifer storage discharged from the pumping."
"The utilization of concrete residue with electric arc furnace slag in the production of geopolymer bricks  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The purpose of this study was to investigate the ratio of concrete residue (CR) and electric arc furnace slag (EAF) for the production of facing brick according to Thai Industrial Standard (TIS) 168-2546. These two industrial wastes contain high alumina and silica for the production of geopolymer bricks. In this research, CR and EAF were collected and homogenously mixed at the following CR to EAF ratios: 100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40, with sodium hydroxide (10M NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) solutions as catalysts. The ratio of Na2SiO3 to 10M NaOH was 2.5. The mixtures were poured in molds (5 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm) and cured in plastic film at room temperature for 28 days. Then the mechanical and chemical properties of the brick specimens were analyzed, including dimensions and tolerances, wryness, deviation from right angles, water absorption, compressive strength, stains, holes, rails, and cracks, according to TIS 168-2546. The results showed that the optimum CR to EAF ratio of geopolymer bricks that was compliant to the TIS 168-2546 standard was 80:20, which had the highest compressive strength value (17.04 MPa) and the lowest water absorption (0.69%). Therefore, CR and EAF can be used as raw materials for facing bricks production."
"A multi model HMM based speech synthesis  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The Multi-Space Probability Distribution Hidden Markov model (MSD-HMM) is a discrete model that learns a fundamental frequency feature, however it has been proven that synthesized speeches from that model contain buzziness and hoarseness which affect to an intelligibility of synthesized speeches. This research aims to improve an intelligibility of synthesized speeches by proposing a multi model HMM based speech synthesis which it models spectral features and fundamental frequency features separately called spectral model and fundamental frequency model instead of combining them to a same model. The fundamental frequency model is modelled by MSD-HMM. Output durations are calculated from maximum probability of both models. A voicing condition restriction rule with minimum output duration criteria are proposed to prevent an unmatched voicing condition of the generated parameter. Objective results show that the proposed multi model is comparable to the shared model while subjective results show that the proposed model with voicing condition restriction rule and without voicing condition restriction rule is outperform the shared model and reduce the buzziness and hoarseness of the synthesized voice. Intelligibility MOS scores of the proposed model with a voicing condition restriction, the proposed model without a voicing condition restriction and the share model are 3.62, 3.69 and 3.08 respectively and naturalness MOS scores are 3.71, 3.71 and 3.14 respectively."
"Flow budget change of groundwater system under climate change in the upper central plain, Thailand  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The Upper Central Plain of Thailand, where farmers depended on both surface water and groundwater. Water allocated from the Bhumibol and Sirikit Dams are limited and caused water shortage in the dry years. Most farmers turn to use groundwater to supplement irrigation water in the dry years. This study aims to understand the flow budget change of groundwater under climate change scenario. The conjunctive use ratio of surfaceas well as groundwater were investigated by field surveys and groundwater flow modeling, using the MODFLOW model to simulate the groundwater movement over the 10 years. The study used the bias-corrected MRI-GCM data to project the future climate conditions (during 2015 -2029 and 2075-2089) and assess the impact on flow budget change of groundwater system. The conjunctive use ratio were analyzed from surface water use and flow budget of groundwater system in term of water demand, rainfall, reservoir storage, groundwater recharge, groundwater storage, groundwater pumping. The study shows the flow budget change and conjunctive use ratio of each season and water year in the past and in the future under climate change scenarios."
"Production scheduling with capacity-lot size and sequence consideration  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The General Lot-sizing and Scheduling Problem (GLSP) is a common problem found in continuous production planning. This problem involves many constraints and decisions including machine capacity, production lot-size, and production sequence. This study proposes a two-phase algorithm for solving large-scale GLSP models. In Phase 1, we generate patterns with a specific batch size and capacity and in Phase 2, based on the patterns selected in Phase 1, we optimize the production allocation. Additionally, the external supplies are included in the formulation to reflect the real situation in business with limited resources. In this work, the justification of the formulation is based on the ability of solving and calculation time. The proposed formulation was tested on eight scenarios. The results show that the proposed formulation is more tractable and is easier to solve than the GLSP."
"Parameter-controllable microchannel reactor for enhanced deposition of copper sulfide thin films  2017 Elsevier B.V.A microchannel reactor was designed and fabricated based on the unique fluid-flow and mass transfer characteristics in a closely parallel channel for the deposition of copper sulfide (CuxS) thin films. The configuration of the microchannel allows the flow pattern to be confined uniformly across the channel width and length, thereby resulting in a uniform deposited thin film covering the whole surface of the substrate. A parametric study of the deposition of CuxS thin films was performed, including the effects of deposition time (2–10 min), flow rate (2–6 ml/min) and reaction temperature (60–80 °C). It was observed that the basic characteristics of CuxS films, such as morphology, film thickness, film composition and optical band gap, were highly affected by all deposition parameters. We were able to attain smooth, dense and adherent CuxS film with homogeneous grains at a high growth rate of 1.8 μm/h, by optimizing the controllable parameters. The optimized condition was at temperature of 80 °C, flow rate of 6 ml/min and deposition time of 4 min. The results showed that the film formation by heterogeneous nucleation and growth on the substrate is promoted over homogeneous reaction in the solution phase, which is strongly due to the incorporation of the optimal channel design in a micro-scale structure together with the controlled deposition parameters. This method can overcome the issue of the deposition in limited area and can be scaled for large-area substrates with good uniformity of CuxS films."
"Monitoring of Surface Roughness in Aluminium Turning Process  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.As the turning process is one of the most necessary process. The surface roughness has been considered for the quality of workpiece. There are many factors which affect the surface roughness. Hence, the objective of this research is to monitor the relation between the surface roughness and the cutting forces in aluminium turning process with a wide range of cutting conditions. The coated carbide tool and aluminium alloy (Al 6063) are used for this experiment. The cutting parameters are investigated to analyze the effects of them on the surface roughness which are the cutting speed, the feed rate, the tool nose radius and the depth of cut. In the case of this research, the dynamometer is installed in the turret of CNC turning machine to generate a signal while turning. The relation between dynamic cutting forces and the surface roughness profile is examined by applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The experimentally obtained results showed that the cutting force depends on the cutting condition. The surface roughness can be improved when increasing the cutting speed and the tool nose radius in contrast to the feed rate and the depth of cut. The relation between the cutting parameters and the surface roughness can be explained by the in-process cutting forces. It is understood that the in-process cutting forces are able to predict the surface roughness in the further research."
"Relationship between compatibilizer and yield strength of PLA/PP Blend  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The aim of this research is to study the relationship between compatibilizer and yield strength of polylactic acid (PLA) and polypropylene (PP) blend. The PLA is blended with PP (PLA/PP) at the ratios of 70/30, 50/50 and 30/70. In addition, (1) polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride (PP-g-MAH) as a compatibilizer at 0.3 and 0.7 part per hundred of PLA/PP resin (phr) and (2) dicumyl peroxide (DCP) being an initiator at 0.03 and 0.07 phr are added in each composition. Yield strength is characterized to study the interaction between compatibilizer, initiator and yield strength by using experimental design of multilevel full factorial. The results show that (1) the yield strength of PLA/PP blend are increased after addition of compatibilizer. Because the adding of PP-g-MAH and DCP resulted in improving compatibility between PLA and PP. (2) there are interaction between PP-g-MAH and DCP that have affected the final properties of PLA/PP blend. The highest yield strength of 27.68 MPa is provided at the ratio of 70/30 blend by using the 0.3 phr of PP-g-MAH and 0.03 phr of DCP. Linear regression model is fitted and follow the assumptions of normal distribution."
"Solar power forecast with weather classification using self-organized map  2017 IEEE.This paper presents a practically efficient method for 1h to 3h ahead solar power forecast (SPF) with weather classification using a Self-Organized Map (SOM). The method requires minimal input data which are normally monitored at all sites so that additional expensive weather observatory devices are not necessary. The proposed SOM can classify weather condition into sunny, cloudy and rainy day, using only the current and past irradiance profile data as input. Then, the ANN-based SPF model for each weather condition is constructed, trained and validated, accordingly. Performance of the proposed method has been evaluated using actual field data from the 500-kW solar farm in Mae Hong Son district, Thailand. Accuracy performance obtained indicates that additional spinning reserve of less than 10 %, with respect to the installed solar power capacity, would be required when the proposed SPF method is applied to the energy management system (EMS) for the city."
"Stacked benefit applications of energy storage systems in distribution circuits  2017 IEEE.This paper develops real and reactive power control methods to demonstrate the viability of deploying energy storage (ES) in simultaneously providing multiple applications, i.e., voltage management and ancillary service in the form of frequency regulation. The location and size of ES for stacked benefit applications are identified. To evaluate the benefits of ES, several case studies are simulated using a distribution system simulator. The simulation results show that ES can successfully provide voltage management and frequency regulation services to the distribution circuit. Voltage regulation can be achieved by controlling the reactive power generated or absorbed by the ES inverter. In this control mode, ES can successfully mitigate the voltage variation concerns due to the variability of both PV generation and the frequency regulation schedule. Frequency regulation service, on the other hand, can be achieved by using real power control of ES. In this control mode, ES charges and discharges in accordance with the frequency regulation schedule. By simultaneously controlling both real and reactive power, ES can provide multiple benefits termed as stacked benefits for the feeder."
"Formal modeling for consistency checking of signal transition graph  2017 IEEE.The behavior of asynchronous hardware system is crucial and practically assured using the formal verification techniques. A signal transition graph is one of the effective alternatives to represent the behavioral design of a huge asynchronous system. The design could be verified beforehand to assure several essential properties including its consistency property. In this paper, the formal modeling scheme of a signal transition graph is proposed along with the consistency property in term of the linear temporal formula. The target signal transition graph is written in Promela code and verified using SPIN model checker. The result shows that the method can verify consistency property automatically."
"Transformation of time Petri net into Promela  2017 IEEE.This paper proposes a method of transformation of time Petri net into Promela in order to verify their behavioral properties of the timed systems. The concurrent systems, with time attributes on transactions, are typically written in time Petri net. For quantitative and qualitative analysis of their properties, these time Petri net would be transformed into Promela beforehand. We also propose the linear temporal formula to specify the correctness properties. The proposed transforming method copes with the representation of both Petri net structure and its dynamic behavior. The token flows in time Petri net are modelled into Promela code, hence the implicit dynamic behavior would be practically described in the model. The resulting Promela code is simulated and verified by SPIN tool and reveals that not only the time related behaviors would be evaluated, but also the qualitative properties, such as safety and liveness."
"Fluorogenic PNA probes  2018 Vilaivan; licensee Beilstein-Institut.Fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes that can produce a change in fluorescence signal upon binding to specific biomolecular targets, including nucleic acids as well as non-nucleic acid targets, such as proteins and small molecules, have applications in various important areas. These include diagnostics, drug development and as tools for studying biomolecular interactions in situ and in real time. The probes usually consist of a labeled oligonucleotide strand as a recognition element together with a mechanism for signal transduction that can translate the binding event into a measurable signal. While a number of strategies have been developed for the signal transduction, relatively little attention has been paid to the recognition element. Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) are DNA mimics with several favorable properties making them a potential alternative to natural nucleic acids for the development of fluorogenic probes, including their very strong and specific recognition and excellent chemical and biological stabilities in addition to their ability to bind to structured nucleic acid targets. In addition, the uncharged backbone of PNA allows for other unique designs that cannot be performed with oligonucleotides or analogues with negatively-charged backbones. This review aims to introduce the principle, showcase state-of-the-art technologies and update recent developments in the areas of fluorogenic PNA probes during the past 20 years."
"Design of Compact Beam-Steering Antennas Using a Metasurface Formed by Uniform Square Rings  2013 IEEE.In this paper, we propose two designs of slot-fed metasurface antenna for beam steering applications. Both designs have the same two-layer stacked configuration consisting of either a single-slot or a double-slot radiator and a metasurface superstrate. In contrast to existing phase-gradient metasurfaces with varying unit elements for beam steering, our proposed metasurface is formed by uniform square rings. At operating frequencies, each square ring acts as an individual resonating element. By exciting the elements in sequence with different phase delays through the slot radiator, the generated antenna beam can be steered. In the first design, the position of the single-slot radiator is shifted to achieve the beam steering functionality; while for the second antenna, to avoid mechanically moving the feeding slot, a double-slot-feeding structure is proposed with two slots excited with varying phase differences. Simulation and experimental results show that beam steering angles of-35° to 35° can be achieved for the single-slot-feeding design and beam steering angles of-30° to 30° are realizable for the double-slot-feeding configuration. Comparing with conventional phased array antennas, our proposed designs have compact size with moderate to high antenna gain."
"Chronic kidney disease incidence and survival of Thai HIV-infected patients  Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Objectives: As data on chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence among Asian HIV patients has been limited, the present study aimed to estimate the CKD incidence in HIV-infected patients who received standard antiretroviral therapy in Thailand and to compare baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients who developed CKD with those who do not. Design: A multicenter, observational prospective cohort of HIV patients with normal kidney functions who received standard antiretroviral therapy. Methods: CKD was diagnosed based on the KDIGO 2012 criteria, using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration based estimated glomerular filtration rate with and without urine protein. The cumulative probability of CKD incidence was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Results: Of 5552 patients, 96 patients with pre-existing CKD and 26 patients with incomplete data were excluded, and 5430 patients were analyzed. Their mean age was 39.87 years, 41.52% were women, and 49.45% were homosexual. They were followed up for 49.41 months on average, with 229 incident cases (4.22%) being identified during 22-035 person-years at risk. Overall CKD incidence rate was 10.39 per 1000 person-years. Average time to CKD was 26.4 months (95% confidence interval: 24.44-28.83). The adjusted relative hazard significantly increased by 8.6% and 10.3% for each additional year of patient age and each additional log 10 copies/ml of HIV viral load, respectively. Patients with diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia had significantly higher adjusted relative hazard (3.37 and 1.41; P-<-0.001 and P-=-0.014), respectively. Conclusion: CKD incidence among the Thai HIV-infected patients was lower than in white and non-Southeast Asian populations. Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, age, and HIV viral load were the significant risk factors. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01328275."
"Bacterial Cellulose Nanocrystals (BCNC) Preparation and Characterization from Three Bacterial Cellulose Sources and Development of Functionalized BCNCs as Nucleic Acid Delivery Systems  2017 American Chemical Society.Bacterial cellulose (BC) is an excellent renewable resource of high-purity cellulose that can be used as original fiber forms or isolated nanocrystalline forms, known as bacterial cellulose nanocrystals (BCNCs), which have gained more attention in the development of highly biocompatible biomaterials. In this work, BCNC production was studied with regard to the influences of the varying BC sources (BC pellicles produced by three different BC-producing bacterial strains of Komagataeibacter xylinus) and acid hydrolysis conditions (hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and a mixture of both acids) on the production yield, morphology, and physicochemical properties of the resulting BCNC. BCNC production with these variable factors provided the distinctive characteristics of rodlike nanocrystals, which can be useful for various applications. For demonstration of the biomedical application as nucleic acid delivery systems, cationic BCNCs were developed by simple cationic surface modification by the physical adsorption of the obtained sulfuric-hydrolyzed BCNC with amines and amine-containing polymers, and the resulting cationic modified BCNCs were evaluated for their complexation ability with siRNA and cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. All unmodified and cationic-modified BCNC samples exhibited low toxicity at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, which assured their good biocompatibility, and the cationic-modified BCNCs with methacrylamide polymers were fully complexed with siRNA. Therefore, this research suggested that a BCNC with the desired properties can be produced by selecting the proper BC sources and acid conditions; also cationic functionalized BCNCs, which revealed their potential as nucleic acid nanocarriers, were easily prepared by simple cationic surface modification."
"Insight into the Role of the Hv1 C-Terminal Domain in Dimer Stabilization  2018 American Chemical Society.The voltage-gated proton-selective channel (Hv1) conducts protons in response to changes in membrane potential. The Hv1 protein forms dimers in the membrane. Crystal structures of Hv1 channels have revealed that the primary contacts between the two monomers are in the C-terminal domain (CTD), which forms a coiled-coil structure. The role of Hv1-CTD in channel assembly and activity is not fully understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of full-length and truncated CTD models of human and mouse Hv1 channels reveal a strong contribution of the CTD to the packing of the transmembrane domains. Simulations of the CTD models highlight four fundamental interactions of the key residues contributing to dimer stability. These include salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and a disulfide bond across the dimer interface. At neutral pH, salt-bridge interactions increase dimer stability and the dimer becomes less stable at acidic pH. Hydrophobic core packing of the heptad pattern is important for stability, as shown by favorable nonpolar binding free energies rather than by electrostatic components. Moreover, free-energy calculations indicate that a more uniform hydrophobic core in the coiled-coil structure of the Hv1-NIN, a channel carrying the triple mutation M234N-N235I-V236N, leads to an increase in dimer stability with respect to the wild-type. A Cys disulfide bond has a strong impact on dimer stability by holding the dimer together and facilitating the interactions described above. These results are consistent with dissociative temperatures and energy barriers of dimer dissociation obtained from the temperature-accelerated MD."
"Mapping superintegrable quantum mechanics to resonant spacetimes  2018 authors.We describe a procedure naturally associating relativistic Klein-Gordon equations in static curved spacetimes to nonrelativistic quantum motion on curved spaces in the presence of a potential. Our procedure is particularly attractive in application to (typically, superintegrable) problems whose energy spectrum is given by a quadratic function of the energy level number, since for such systems the spacetimes one obtains possess evenly spaced, resonant spectra of frequencies for scalar fields of a certain mass. This construction emerges as a generalization of the previously studied correspondence between the Higgs oscillator and anti-de Sitter spacetime, which has been useful for both understanding weakly nonlinear dynamics in anti-de Sitter spacetime and algebras of conserved quantities of the Higgs oscillator. Our conversion procedure (""Klein-Gordonization"") reduces to a nonlinear elliptic equation closely reminiscent of the one emerging in relation to the celebrated Yamabe problem of differential geometry. As an illustration, we explicitly demonstrate how to apply this procedure to superintegrable Rosochatius systems, resulting in a large family of spacetimes with resonant spectra for massless wave equations."
"Antibiotic use and new-onset inflammatory bowel disease in Olmsted county, Minnesota: A population-based case-control study  2017 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Background and Aims: Several studies have suggested significant associations between environmental factors and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. However, data supporting the role of antibiotics are conflicting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between antibiotic use and new-onset IBD. Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study using the Rochester Epidemiology Project of Olmsted County, Minnesota. We identified 736 county residents diagnosed with IBD between 1980 and 2010 who were matched to 1472 controls, based on age, sex and date of IBD diagnosis. Data on antibiotic use between 3 months and 5 years before IBD diagnosis were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between antibiotic use and IBD, and were expressed as adjusted odds ratio [AOR] with 95% confidence interval [CI]. Results: Antibiotic use occurred in 455 IBD cases [61.8%] and 495 controls [33.6%] [p < 0.001]. In multivariate analysis, there were statistically significant associations between antibiotic use and new-onset IBD [AOR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.40-3.58], Crohn's disease [CD] [AOR, 3.01; 2.27-4.00] and ulcerative colitis [UC] [AOR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.23-3.88]. A cumulative duration of antibiotic use ≥ 30 days had the strongest AOR [6.01; 95% CI, 4.34-8.45]. AOR for those receiving antibiotics under the age of 18 years was 4.27 [95% CI, 2.39-7.91], 2.97 for age 18-60 years [2.36-3.75] and 2.72 for age > 60 years [1.60-4.67]. Conclusions: This population-based case-control study suggests a strong association between antibiotic use and the risk of both new-onset CD and new-onset UC. The risk was increased among all age-onset IBD."
"Fabrication of a Paper-Based Turn-Off Fluorescence Sensor for Cu2+ Ion from a Pyridinium Porphyrin  2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA cationic porphyrin, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridinio)porphyrin tetraiodide (TMPyP) was reported herein to exert selective, turn-off fluorescence when complexed with Cu2+ ion. Although discernible spectroscopic changes of charged porphyrins with various metal ions were previously utilized as colorimetric sensors, the application of fluorescence quenching of charged porphyrins with Cu2+ ion has never been investigated in much detail before. Coupled with the ease of synthesis, the finding led to a construction of a simple paper-based sensor for Cu2+ with good selectivity and sensitivity, with a limit of detection at 0.16 ppm, which is below the recommended amount in drinking water. Notably, this performance could be achieved with the need of only a handheld UV lamp and a smartphone or a compact camera, both of which are now considered to be highly accessible.

"Size and sequence polymorphisms in the glutamate-rich protein gene of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in Thailand  2018 The Author(s).Background: The glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a key surface antigen that serves as a component of a clinical vaccine. Moreover, the GLURP gene is also employed routinely as a genetic marker for malarial genotyping in epidemiological studies. While extensive size polymorphisms in GLURP are well recorded, the extent of the sequence diversity of this gene is rarely investigated. The present study aimed to explore the genetic diversity of GLURP in natural populations of P. falciparum. Results: The polymorphic C-terminal repetitive R2 region of GLURP sequences from 65 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand were generated and combined with the data from 103 worldwide isolates to generate a GLURP database. The collection was comprised of 168 alleles, encoding 105 unique GLURP subtypes, characterized by 18 types of amino acid repeat units (AAU). Of these, 28 GLURP subtypes, formed by 10 AAU types, were detected in P. falciparum in Thailand. Among them, 19 GLURP subtypes and 2 AAU types are described for the first time in the Thai parasite population. The AAU sequences were highly conserved, which is likely due to negative selection. Standard Fst analysis revealed the shared distributions of GLURP types among the P. falciparum populations, providing evidence of gene flow among the different demographic populations. Conclusions: Sequence diversity causing size variations in GLURP in Thai P. falciparum populations were detected, and caused by non-synonymous substitutions in repeat units and some insertion/deletion of aspartic acid or glutamic acid codons between repeat units. The P. falciparum population structure based on GLURP showed promising implications for the development of GLURP-based vaccines and for monitoring vaccine efficacy."
"Development of bacterial cellulose incorporating silk sericin, polyhexamethylene biguanide, and glycerin with enhanced physical properties and antibacterial activities for wound dressing application  2017 Taylor & Francis.Bacterial cellulose (BC) has been applied for wound dressing application. In this study, physical and biological properties of the BC dressing were improved by incorporation of silk sericin (SS), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), and glycerin. The glycerin incorporation reduced dehydration rate and wound adhesion of the BC dressing in a concentration-dependent manner. PHMB, an antiseptic agent, provided antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Meanwhile, SS would enhance collagen and tissue formation in wounds. Finally, we confirmed that the BC dressing incorporating SS, PHMB, and glycerin was safe to be used as a medical material according to ISO 10993-6 standard."
"Gold nanoparticle core-europium(iii) chelate fluorophore-doped silica shell hybrid nanocomposites for the lateral flow immunoassay of human thyroid stimulating hormone with a dual signal readout  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Hybrid nanocomposite particles composed of a gold core coated with a europium(iii)-chelate fluorophore-doped silica shell (AuNPs@SiO2-Eu3+) have been synthesized and applied as antibody labels in lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices for the determination of human thyroid stimulating hormone (hTSH). Labeling of monoclonal anti-hTSH antibodies with AuNPs@SiO2-Eu3+ nanocomposites allows for both colorimetric and fluorometric observation of assay results on LFIA devices, relying on visible light absorption due to the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Au-core and the fluorescence emission of the Eu(iii)-chelate-modified shell under UV hand lamp irradiation (365 nm), respectively. The possibility for a dual signal readout provides an attractive alternative for LFIAs: instantaneous naked eye observation of the AuNP colorimetric signal as in conventional LFIAs for hypothyroidism detection, and more sensitive fluorescence detection to assess hyperthyroidism. The limits of detection (LOD) for naked eye observation of LFIA devices are 5 μIU mL-1 and 0.1 μIU mL-1 for the colorimetric and fluorimetric detection, respectively. Using the fluorescence detection scheme in combination with a smartphone and digital color analysis, a quantitative linear relationship between the red intensity and the logarithmic concentration of hTSH was observed (R2 = 0.988) with an LOD of 0.02 μIU mL-1. Finally, LFIA devices were effectively applied for detecting hTSH in spiked diluted human serum with recovery values between 100-116%."
"Prevalence of Non-AIDS Comorbidities and Factors Associated with Metabolic Complications among HIV-Infected Patients at a Thai Referral Hospital  The Author(s) 2018.Objectives: The prevalence of non-AIDS-related comorbidities is increasing in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In Thailand, data regarding the prevalence of non-AIDS comorbidities and factors associated with metabolic complications in HIV-infected patients have not been well-documented. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 and included 874 HIV-infected patients. Results: The age of patients was 45(8) years represented as mean (standard deviation [SD]). The current CD4 count was 502(247) cells/mm3. In all, 388 (44%) of the included patients had at least 1non-AIDS comorbidity. The most frequently documented comorbidities were hyperlipidemia in 271 (70%) patients. Using multivariate analysis, older age(odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-2.19), male sex (OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.14-2.11), high current CD4 count(OR = 1.00, 95%CI = 1.00-1.00), and taking abacavir (ABC)-containing(OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.16-5.78)and didanosine (ddI)-containing antiretroviral regimens (OR = 4.16, 95%CI = 1.09-15.84)were associated with the presence of metabolic complications (all Ps<.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of comorbidities is substantially high. Clinical monitoring and effective management of these comorbidities and metabolic complications are recommended, especially in HIV-infected patients who present with these associated factors."
"Oral cancer: A multicenter study  Medicina Oral S. L. C.I.F.Background: To determine the prevalence and clinicopathologic features of the oral cancer patients. Material and Methods: Biopsy records of the participating institutions were reviewed for oral cancer cases diagnosed from 2005 to 2014. Demographic data and site of the lesions were collected. Sites of the lesion were subdivided into lip, tongue, floor of the mouth, gingiva, alveolar mucosa, palate, buccal/labial mucosa, maxilla and mandible. Oral cancer was subdivided into 7 categories: epithelial tumors, salivary gland tumors, hematologic tumors, bone tumors, mesenchymal tumors, odontogenic tumors, and others. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics using SPSS software version 17.0. Results: Of the 474,851 accessioned cases, 6,151 cases (1.30%) were diagnosed in the category of oral cancer. The mean age of the patients was 58.37±15.77 years. A total of 4,238 cases (68.90%) were diagnosed in males, whereas 1911 cases (31.07%) were diagnosed in females. The male-to-female ratio was 2.22:1. The sites of predilection for oral cancer were tongue, labial/buccal mucosa, gingiva, palate, and alveolar mucosa, respectively. The three most common oral cancer in the descending order of frequency were squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Conclusions: Although the prevalence of oral cancer is not high compared to other entities, oral cancer pose significant mortality and morbidity in the patients, especially when discovered late in the course of the disease. This study highlights some anatomical locations where oral cancers are frequently encountered. As a result, clinicians should pay attention to not only teeth, but oral mucosa especially in the high prevalence area as well since early detection of precancerous lesions or cancers in the early stage increase the chance of patient being cured and greatly reduce the mortality and morbidity. This study also shows some differences between pediatric and elderly oral cancer patients as well as between Asian and non-Asian oral cancer patients."
"ALMA 26 arcmin2 Survey of GOODS-S at One-millimeter (ASAGAO): X-Ray AGN Properties of Millimeter-selected Galaxies  2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We investigate the X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) properties of millimeter galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field detected with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), by utilizing the Chandra 7-Ms data, the deepest X-ray survey to date. Our millimeter galaxy sample comes from the ASAGAO survey covering 26 arcmin2 (12 sources at a 1.2 mm flux-density limit of mJy), supplemented by the deeper but narrower 1.3 mm survey of a part of the ASAGAO field by Dunlop et al. Ofthe 25 total millimeter galaxies, 14 have Chandra counterparts. The observed AGN fractions at are found to be 90+8-19% and 57+23-25% for the ultra-luminous and luminous infrared galaxies with log LIR/L⊙ = 12-12.8 and log IR/L⊙ = 11.5-12, respectively. The majority (∼2/3) of the ALMA and/or Herschel detected X-ray AGNs at z = 1.5-3 appear to be star-formation-dominant populations, having / ratios smaller than the ""simultaneous evolution"" value expected from the local black-hole-mass-to-stellar-mass (-M ∗) relation. On the basis of the and stellar mass relation, we infer that a large fraction of star-forming galaxies at have black hole masses that are smaller than those expected from the local -M ∗ relation. This contrasts previous reports on luminous AGNs at the same redshifts detected in wider and shallower surveys, which are subject to selection biases against lower luminosity AGNs. Our results are consistent with an evolutionary scenario in which star formation occurs first, and an AGN-dominant phase follows later, in objects that finally evolve into galaxies with classical bulges."
"Molecular cloning and comparative analysis of variable regions of monoclonal antibody against enrofloxacin clone 48  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Enrofloxacin is fluoroquinolone antibiotic which prohibited approved for treatment in animals. However, their residues in animal products can pose adverse side effects to consumer. Therefore, the maximum residue limit of these drugs has been enforced in many countries. In this study, the cDNA encoding VH and VL genes was amplified from monoclonal antibody which was specific to enrofloxacin clone 48, cloned and sequenced. The obtained sequences were compared in the NCBI databases by using blastp program. The results found that VH nucleotide was composed of about 399 bps and theirs deduced amino acids showed 80-85% degree identities to the Ig superfamily group. A totally 356 bps of VL nucleotide was found and showed the degree of identities of 97-100% with an immunoglobulin kappa light chain. Moreover, the CDR I, CDR II and CDR III of the VH and VL sequences were specified. The results indicated that the highest degree of VH sequence homology (highest relationship) found in accession no. B26471 with 80% homology. However, 100% of VL sequences were found similarly to accession no. AHJ10945.1 than the others. The obtained results provided the useful and important information for the further recombinant antibody construction and production against enrofloxacin antibiotic."
"Design and Control of a Small-Scale Isolated Concentrated Solar Power Generation Unit  2017 American Chemical Society.Electricity generated by small-size concentrated solar power (CSP)-driven Rankine cycle (RC) is an increasingly explored alternative for powering isolated homes/small communities. In these units, solar energy is captured to raise the temperature of a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The hot HTF drives a low-temperature Rankine cycle to generate electricity for the household(s). Because the solar flux follows the diurnal transient cycle along with high variability in the power demand, very large inventory of the HTF is needed to store the solar energy and supply heat to the Rankine cycle, including when the solar flux is zero at night. There then is no steady state for the process and it must be designed for inherently transient operation over a very large operating window. Simultaneous design and control evaluation to ensure robust operation for such a large operating window is then essential. This work presents the same for a small scale 20 kW isolated CSP-RC power generation unit. Three enhancements to the basic flowsheet are developed with quantified benefits in terms of improved overall process efficiency, significantly reduced HTF inventory and the flexibility of capturing extra solar energy. A robust control strategy with appropriate overrides for handling process constraints is developed for the enhanced flowsheet and tested using rigorous dynamic simulations. The closed loop results are used to size the necessary HTF inventory. These results demonstrate the robustness of the control system in the face of extreme disturbances in power demand and the captured solar flux."
"Facile conversion of ATP-binding RNA aptamer to quencher-free molecular aptamer beacon  2017 Elsevier LtdWe have developed RNA-based quencher-free molecular aptamer beacons (RNA-based QF-MABs) for the detection of ATP, taking advantage of the conformational changes associated with ATP binding to the ATP-binding RNA aptamer. The RNA aptamer, with its well-defined structure, was readily converted to the fluorescence sensors by incorporating a fluorophore into the loop region of the hairpin structure. These RNA-based QF-MABs exhibited fluorescence signals in the presence of ATP relative to their low background signals in the absence of ATP. The fluorescence emission intensity increased upon formation of a RNA-based QF-MAB·ATP complex."
"Cyclodextrins: structure, physicochemical properties and pharmaceutical applications  2017 Elsevier B.V.Since their discovery over 100 years ago cyclodextrins (CDs) have been the subject of numerous scientific publications. In 2016 alone CDs were the subject of over 2200 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals and mentioned in over 2300 patents and patent applications, many of which were on pharmaceutical applications. Natural CDs and their derivatives are used as enabling pharmaceutical excipients that enhance aqueous solubility of poorly soluble drugs, increase drug permeability through biological membranes and improve drug bioavailability. Unlike conventional penetration enhancers, their hydrophilic structure and high molecular weight prevents them from penetrate into lipophilic membranes leaving biological membranes intact. The natural CDs and some of their derivatives have monographs in pharmacopeias and are also commonly used as food additives and in toiletry products. CDs form inclusion complexes with lipophilic moieties of hydrophobic drugs. Furthermore, CDs are able to form non-inclusion complexes and self-assembled aggregates; small and large complex aggregates with micellar-like structures that can enhance drug solubility. Excipients commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations may have additive or inhibiting effect on the CD solubilization. Here various methods used to investigate CD aggregate formation are reviewed as well as techniques that are used to increase the solubilizing effects of CDs; methods that enhance the apparent intrinsic solubility of drugs and/or the complexation efficacy and decrease the amount of CD needed to develop CD-containing pharmaceutical formulations. It will be explained how too much or too little CD can hamper drug bioavailability, and the role of CDs in solid dosage forms and parenteral formulations, and examples given on how CDs can enhance drug delivery after ocular, nasal and pulmonary administration."
"Effects of temperature and HRT on performance of a novel insulated anaerobic filter (IAF) system incorporated with the waste heat input for building wastewater treatment  2017 Elsevier LtdEffects of temperature and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the performance of the novel insulated anaerobic filter system (IAF) incorporated with the waste heat input in treating building wastewater were investigated. In this study, an electric heater was used to simulate the waste heat input from air conditioner to the IAF system. The wastewater was collected from an office building in Phitsanulok province, Thailand. The HRTs of IAF system were varied to 9, 18 and 27 h, whereas the water temperatures were raised from 30 °C to 35 °C, 40 °C and 45 °C by electric heating to the IAF tank with the covered insulator. From the results, it was found that the IAF system with HRT 27 h and water temperature 35 °C had the highest removal efficiencies for SS, COD, TKN and TP at 67.71, 61.35, 51.20 and 20.08%, respectively per applied heat energy of 4.70 Wh. The predominant bacteria and Archaea species in the system were Uncultured Flavobacterium sp. and Uncultured Methanosaeta sp. The performance index of the IAF system was developed in this study as the highest treatment performance per lowest energy consumption. Therefore, the IAF system incorporated with waste heat input can be a challenging on-site wastewater treatment system for further usage of renewable energy from waste heat as well as environmental conservation."
"Electrically controlled release of ibuprofen from conductive poly(3-methoxydiphenylamine)/crosslinked pectin hydrogel  2017 Elsevier B.V.The pristine pectin hydrogels and conductive polymer/hydrogel blends were prepared by the solution casting using ferrous chloride (FeCl2) and citric acid as the crosslinking agents, and ibuprofen as the model drug and the doping agent. A conductive polymer, poly(3-methoxydiphenylamine), was successfully synthesized and embedded into the pristine pectin hydrogels as the drug encapsulation host. The in-vitro release of ibuprofen from the hydrogels was investigated by a modified Franz diffusion cell filled with a MES buffer solution, with pH of 5.5, at 37 °C, for a period of 48 h to investigate the effects of the crosslinking agent type, crosslinking mole ratio, mesh size, electric potential, and conductive polymer. The release behavior of ibuprofen from the pectin hydrogels was found to involve 4 modes of release: Fickian diffusion; Anomalous transport; Case-II transport; and Super case II transport. The diffusion coefficient was shown to be significantly improved by two factors: using a FeCl2 as the crosslinking agent and applied electric potential. For both crosslinking agents, the drug diffusion coefficient increased with decreasing crosslinking ratio. Under electric field of 5 V, the drug diffusion coefficients of the FeCl2 and citric acid hydrogels were enhanced by more than a factor of two due to the electro-repulsive interaction between ibuprofen and the negatively charged electrode. Moreover, the synthesized poly(3-methoxydiphenylamine) embedded in the pectin hydrogels as the drug encapsulation host was shown to enhance the diffusion coefficients and to reduce the overall release times."
"Transmission surface plasmon resonance techniques and their potential biosensor applications  2017 Elsevier B.V.Transmission surface plasmon resonance (TSPR) is an unusual extraordinary optical transmission that is more transparent at certain wavelengths than expected by classical theory. The three main plasmonic structures that providing this phenomenon are nanohole arrays, diffraction gratings, and nanoslit arrays. This extraordinary optical transmission phenomenon is produced as a result of surface plasmon excitations. The shifting in TSPR responses upon changing of dielectric environment at the surface of a metallic film was observed. After TSPR was discovered from metallic nanohole arrays in 1998, the number of papers about this topic rapidly increased. In the 20 years since, TSPR has been utilized to improve the detection limits, sensitivity, selectivity, and dynamic range of biosensing devices, resulting in them having greater potential for commercialization. This review gives a broad overview of the TSPR phenomenon, the development of this technique, and the typical experimental setups used to acquire TSPR signals; it also describes how they are applied in the field of research into biosensors."
"Developing fragility functions for aquaculture rafts and eelgrass in the case of the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami  2018 Biological Society of Washington. All rights reserved.Since the two devastating tsunamis in 2004 (Indian Ocean) and 2011 (Great East Japan), new findings have emerged on the relationship between tsunami characteristics and damage in terms of fragility functions. Human loss and damage to buildings and infrastructures are the primary target of recovery and reconstruction; thus, such relationships for offshore properties and marine ecosystems remain unclear. To overcome this lack of knowledge, this study used the available data from two possible target areas (Mangokuura Lake and Matsushima Bay) from the 2011 Japan tsunami. This study has three main components: (1) reproduction of the 2011 tsunami, (2) damage investigation, and (3) fragility function development. First, the source models of the 2011 tsunami were verified and adjusted to reproduce the tsunami characteristics in the target areas. Second, the damage ratio (complete damage) of the aquaculture raft and eelgrass was investigated using satellite images taken before and after the 2011 tsunami through visual inspection and binarization. Third, the tsunami fragility functions were developed using the relationship between the simulated tsunami characteristics and the estimated damage ratio. Based on the statistical analysis results, fragility functions were developed for Mangokuura Lake, and the flow velocity was the main contributor to the damage instead of the wave amplitude. For example, the damage ratio above 0.9 was found to be equal to the maximum flow velocities of 1.3 m s-1 (aquaculture raft) and 3.0 m s-1 (eelgrass). This finding is consistent with the previously proposed damage criterion of 1 m s-1 for the aquaculture raft. This study is the first step in the development of damage assessment and planning for marine products and environmental factors to mitigate the effects of future tsunamis."
"Azimuthal anisotropy of charged particles with transverse momentum up to 100 GeV/c in PbPb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV  2017 The AuthorThe Fourier coefficients v2 and v3 characterizing the anisotropy of the azimuthal distribution of charged particles produced in PbPb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV are measured with data collected by the CMS experiment. The measurements cover a broad transverse momentum range, 1<pT<100 GeV/c. The analysis focuses on the pT>10 GeV/c range, where anisotropic azimuthal distributions should reflect the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in the created medium. Results are presented in several bins of PbPb collision centrality, spanning the 60% most central events. The v2 coefficient is measured with the scalar product and the multiparticle cumulant methods, which have different sensitivities to initial-state fluctuations. The values from both methods remain positive up to pT∼60–80 GeV/c, in all examined centrality classes. The v3 coefficient, only measured with the scalar product method, tends to zero for pT≳20 GeV/c. Comparisons between theoretical calculations and data provide new constraints on the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in heavy ion collisions and highlight the importance of the initial-state fluctuations."
"Measurements of tt¯ cross sections in association with b jets and inclusive jets and their ratio using dilepton final states in pp collisions at s=13TeV  2017 The AuthorThe cross sections for the production of tt¯bb¯ and tt¯jj events and their ratio σtt¯bb¯/σtt¯jj are measured using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb−1collected in pp collisions at s=13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Events with two leptons (e or μ) and at least four reconstructed jets, including at least two identified as b quark jets, in the final state are selected. In the full phase space, the measured ratio is 0.022±0.003(stat)±0.006(syst), the cross section σtt¯bb¯ is 4.0±0.6(stat)±1.3(syst) pb and σtt¯jj is 184±6(stat)±33(syst) pb. The measurements are compared with the standard model expectations obtained from a POWHEG simulation at next-to-leading-order interfaced with PYTHIA."
"Preparation of hydrothermal carbon as catalyst support for conversion of biomass to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural  2017 Elsevier B.V.Suitable hydrothermal carbonization conditions including temperature (180–250 °C) and time (6–24 h) were determined for the preparation of glucose derived carbon material, used as a catalyst support for sugar and cellulose conversions. While hydrothermal carbons (HTCs) prepared at various conditions exhibited similar chemical and structural characteristics, examination of liquid fractions from hydrothermal carbonization provided additional evidence on the stability of the HTCs. The suitable hydrothermal carbonization condition was found to be 220 °C and 6 h, providing a stable carbon support that after sulfonation, yielded carbon-based acid catalyst (HTC220-6-SO3H) that exhibit relatively high catalytic activities for cellulose hydrolysis and fructose dehydration reaction, giving glucose and HMF yields of 43.63 ± 1.62 wt.% and 20.29 ± 1.09 wt.%, respectively."
CuCl2/[hmim]Br: A new recyclable catalytic system for aromatization of cyclic dienes  2017 Elsevier B.V.The combination of copper(II) chloride and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([hmim]Br) as a new recyclable catalytic system in the presence of TBHP for aromatization of cyclic dienes is disclosed. The system could furnish the corresponding aromatics in moderate to excellent yield. The competition between aromatization and oxidation of benzylic substrates were also studied. This developed catalytic system could be reused and recycled at least nine times without significant loss of the producitivity.
"Global sequence diversity of the lactate dehydrogenase gene in Plasmodium falciparum  2018 The Author(s).Background: Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been recommended by the World Health Organization for use in remote areas to improve malaria case management. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of Plasmodium falciparum is one of the main parasite antigens employed by various commercial RDTs. It has been hypothesized that the poor detection of LDH-based RDTs is attributed in part to the sequence diversity of the gene. To test this, the present study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of the P. falciparum ldh gene in Thailand and to construct the map of LDH sequence diversity in P. falciparum populations worldwide. Methods: The ldh gene was sequenced for 50 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand and compared with hundreds of sequences from P. falciparum populations worldwide. Several indices of molecular variation were calculated, including the proportion of polymorphic sites, the average nucleotide diversity index (π), and the haplotype diversity index (H). Tests of positive selection and neutrality tests were performed to determine signatures of natural selection on the gene. Mean genetic distance within and between species of Plasmodium ldh was analysed to infer evolutionary relationships. Results: Nucleotide sequences of P. falciparum ldh could be classified into 9 alleles, encoding 5 isoforms of LDH. L1a was the most common allelic type and was distributed in P. falciparum populations worldwide. Plasmodium falciparum ldh sequences were highly conserved, with haplotype and nucleotide diversity values of 0.203 and 0.0004, respectively. The extremely low genetic diversity was maintained by purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. Phylogenetic analysis inferred the close genetic relationship of P. falciparum to malaria parasites of great apes, rather than to other human malaria parasites. Conclusions: This study revealed the global genetic variation of the ldh gene in P. falciparum, providing knowledge for improving detection of LDH-based RDTs and supporting the candidacy of LDH as a therapeutic drug target."
"Forecasting of incoming calls in a commercial bank service call center  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.In this study, we develop forecast models for incoming calls at a call center of a commercial bank in Thailand. We found that incoming calls are non-stationary. Normally, the number of calls is low during holiday and high during the beginning and ending of each month. Various time series models are applied for monthly forecast and an algorithm based on seasonal pattern is proposed for daily forecast. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are used for comparing the proposed methodology and the current model that the bank uses. The results show that the proposed methodology is better than the current model. MAPE reduces from 9.79% to 8.12% and RMSE reduces from 960.37 to 861.88."
"A development of a prediction model for ungauged catchment in the north of Thailand  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Flow data are essential for hydrological study, planning, and management to prevent drought and flood in a region. In catchments where flow data are not recorded or of poor quality, hydrological indices could be an alternative for predicting flow in ungauged catchments. This study demonstrates the methodology for predicting flow in ungauged catchments through the case study of 37 sub-catchments of the upper Ping catchment in northwest Thailand from 2006-2014. The regression method was applied to investigate the relationship between three flow indices including runoff coefficient, base flow index, and 95th percentile of flow, and catchment properties. The prediction interval of the regression relationship was used to condition rainfall-runoff model parameters. The model performance was tested by NSE∗ and reliability. The 95th percentile of flow was found to be the most informative index to regionalize flow followed by RC. The BFI had least contribution to the prediction of flow with poor NSE∗ and large uncertainty. The 95th percentile of flow and RC generally worked well for small sub-catchments."
"Study on occlusion-induced mechanical force distribution in dental pulp using 3-D modeling based on finite element analysis  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.The dental pulp plays an important role in maintaining the functional status of the tooth. Proper masticatory force helped maintaining the dental pulp vitality. However, the force distributed into the dental pulp could not be directly measured. Currently available simulation models were single unit and/or unrealistic in shape and dimension. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel real geometry of whole teeth 3D model based on the CT scan system and conducted static structural analyses using the finite element analysis (FEA). The developed model of the mandibular first molar consisted of multicomponent of enamel, dentin and dental pulp. The masticatory loading condition for simulation was performed in three conditions at the average biting force of 54.3 MPa. The results showed that the average occlusal pressure did not cause failure of the tooth components as the max Von Mises stress did not exceed its ultimate strength. Simulation results revealed that the average normal stresses at the peaks of the dental pulp was only 0.003 MPa, which was less than 1% of that exerted on the enamel."
"Acute effect of Clitoria ternatea flower beverage on glycemic response and antioxidant capacity in healthy subjects: A randomized crossover trial  2018 The Author(s).Background: Clitoria ternatea L., a natural food-colorant containing anthocyanin, demonstrated antioxidant and antihyperglycemic activity. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Clitoria ternatea flower extract (CTE) on postprandial plasma glycemia response and antioxidant status in healthy men. Methods: In a randomized, crossover study, 15 healthy men (ages 22.53 ± 0.30 years; with body mass index of 21.57 ± 0.54 kg/m2) consumed five beverages: (1) 50 g sucrose in 400 mL water; (2) 1 g CTE in 400 mL of water; (3) 2 g CTE in 400 mL of water; (4) 50 g sucrose and 1 g CTE in 400 mL of water; and (5) 50 g sucrose and 2 g CTE in 400 mL of water. Incremental postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, uric acid, antioxidant capacities and lipid peroxidation were measured during 3 h of administration. Results: After 30 min ingestion, the postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels were suppressed when consuming sucrose plus 1 g and 2 g CTE. In addition, consumption of CTE alone did not alter plasma glucose and insulin concentration in the fasting state. The significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and protein thiol) and the decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) level were observed in the subjects who received 1 g and 2 g CTE. Furthermore, consumption of CTE protected sucrose-induced reduction in ORAC and TEAC and increase in plasma MDA. Conclusions: These findings suggest that an acute ingestion of CTE increases plasma antioxidant capacity without hypoglycemia in the fasting state. It also improves postprandial glucose, insulin and antioxidant status when consumed with sucrose. Trial registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20170609003. Registered 09 September 2017.

"Well-Defined Cationic N-[3-(Dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide Hydrochloride-Based (Co)polymers for siRNA Delivery  2017 American Chemical Society.Cationic glycopolymers have shown to be excellent candidates for the fabrication of gene delivery devices due to their ability to electrostatically interact with negatively charged nucleic acids and the carbohydrate residues ensure enhanced stability and low toxicity of the polyplexes. The ability to engineer the polymers for optimized compositions, molecular weights, and architectures is critical in the design of effective gene delivery vehicles. Therefore, in this study, the aqueous reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) was used to synthesize well-defined cationic glycopolymers with various cationic segments. For the preparation of cationic parts, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide hydrochloride (DMAPMA·HCl), water-soluble methacrylamide monomer containing tertiary amine, was polymerized to produce DMAPMA·HCl homopolymer, which was then used as macroCTA in the block copolymerization with two other methacrylamide monomers containing different pendant groups, namely, 2-aminoethyl methacrylamide hydrochloride (AEMA) (with primary amine) and N-(3-aminopropyl) morpholine methacrylamide (MPMA) (with morpholine ring). In addition, statistical copolymers of DMAPMA.HCl with either AEMA or MPMA were also synthesized. All resulting cationic polymers were utilized as macroCTA for the RAFT copolymerization with 2-lactobionamidoethyl methacrylamide (LAEMA), which consists of the pendent galactose residues to achieve DMAPMA·HCl-based glycopolymers. From the in vitro cytotoxicity study, the cationic glycopolymers showed better cell viabilities than the corresponding cationic homopolymers. Furthermore, complexation of the cationic polymers with siRNA, cellular uptake of the resulting polyplexes, and gene knockdown efficiencies were evaluated. All cationic polymers/glycopolymers demonstrated good complexation ability with siRNA at low weight ratios. Among these cationic polymer-siRNA polyplexes, the polyplexes prepared from the two glycopolymers, P(DMAPMA65-b-LAEMA15) and P[(DMAPMA65-b-MPMA63)-b-LAEMA16], showed outstanding results in the cellular uptake, high EGFR knockdown, and low post-transfection toxicity, suggesting the great potential in siRNA delivery of these novel glycopolymers."
"Synthesis, characterization and single crystal X-ray structure determination of three cadmium(II) complexes derived from picric acid and p-nitrobenzoic acid in the presence and absence of nitrogen donor ligand N-(hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine  2017 Elsevier LtdCadmium, an extremely toxic heavy metal, is of a major public health concern and its efficient removal from the environment is a real challenge. This work aims for a deep understanding of stable cadmium(II) chelation with a tridentate ligand to form complex salts being stabilized by cation–anion hydrogen bonding non-covalent interactions in addition to electrostatic interactions. Three new Cd(II) complexes, [Cd(H2O)6](pic)2·2H2O 1, [Cd(N-hyden)2](pic)2 2, [Cd(N-hyden)2](pnb)2 3, (where N-hyden = N-(hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine, Hpic = picric acid and Hpnb = p-nitrobenzoic acid) using the appropriate acids in the absence and presence of the tridentate N-hyden ligand have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analyses and spectroscopic (FT-IR, NMR) techniques. The exact ionic structures of complexes 1–3 have been unambiguously determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. They comprise octahedrally surrounded cationic Cd(II) centers, [Cd(H2O)6]2+ in 1 and [Cd(N-hyden)2]2+ in 2 and 3, together with the counter anions pic/pnb, which are stabilized by a mutual interplay of various hydrogen bonding interactions."
"WebP-based high capacity image steganography  2018 ACM.Nowadays, Cryptography is widely used in data protection, however, one major drawback of the scheme is that it draws attention to an attacker, which results in perceptibility of those data. In order to handle this kind of problem, Steganography can be used instead. It can be operated in two domains: Spatial and frequency domains. Usually, spatial domain-based methods usually yield higher payload than transform domain-based methods. On the other hand, transform domain-based methods usually work well with image compression. In a recent survey, many existing transform domain-based methods are designed for a JPEG-based image. Even though the JPEG-based image is widely used, the JPEG compression performance is not good enough in cloud era for which tons of images are transferred over the internet. Thus, the newer image format such as WebP is presented to provide better compression performance. In this research, the new scheme for image steganography based on WebP is presented. The proposed method archived good performance in terms of data capacity, image quality and file size compared to the existing JPEG-based method. Moreover, because WebP supports alpha-channel. Thus, image steganography with alpha-channel is also introduced."
"Effects of socioscientific issues-based instruction on argumentation ability and biology concepts of upper secondary school students  2018 Author(s).Argumentation skill is an essential skill needed in students, and one of the competencies in scientific literacy. Through arguing on socioscientific issues, students may gain deeper conceptual understanding. The purpose of this research is to examine the efficacy of a socioscientific issues-based instruction compared with an inquirybased instruction. This is to determine which one is better in promoting 10th grade students' argumentation ability and biology concepts of digestive system and cellular respiration. The forty 10th grade students included in this study were from two mathematics-science program classes in a medium-sized secondary school located in a suburb of Buriram province, Thailand. The research utilizes a quasi-experimental design; pre-test post-test control group design. We developed and implemented 4 lesson plans for both socioscientific issues-based instruction and inquiry-based instruction. Ten weeks were used to collect the data. A paper-based questionnaire and informal interviews were designed to test students' argumentation ability, and the two-tier multiple-choice test was designed to test their biology concepts. This research explore qualitatively and quantitatively students' argumentation abilities and biology concepts, using arithmetic mean, mean of percentage, standard deviation and t-test. Results show that there is no significant difference between the two group regarding mean scores of the argumentation ability. However, there is significant difference between the two groups regarding mean scores of the biology concepts. This suggests that socioscientific issues-based instruction could be used to improve students' biology concepts."
"Carbonized electrospun polyvinylpyrrolidone/metal hybrid nanofiber composites for electrochemical applications  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Electrospinning is a very versatile and efficient method of fabricating nanofibers with the desired properties. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in ethanol solution was electrospun into nanofibers and used as a precursor for the preparation of carbon nanofibers. Cobalt chloride was also incorporated with PVP nanofibers to produce carbon nanofiber composites with enhanced electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties. The surface morphology and physical properties of the electrospun nanofibers, carbonized nanofibers, and their composites were observed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical behavior of the carbon nanofiber composites was studied by drop-casting on a working surface of the screen-printed carbon electrode and examined by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicated that carbon nanofiber composites were decorated with cobalt nanoparticles and enhanced the charge-transfer efficiency on the electrode surface.  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

"Hydrolyzed collagen-grafted-poly[(acrylic acid)-co-(methacrylic acid)] hydrogel for drug delivery  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Hydrolyzed collagen-grafted-poly[(acrylic acid)-co-(methacrylic acid)] hydrogels were synthesized by solution polymerization and confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. From sequential univariate analysis, the optimal molar ratio of acrylic acid: methacrylic acid was 92:8 in the presence of N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, ammonium persulfate, and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine at 0.12, 0.015, and 0.2% mol of the monomers, respectively. The water absorbency of this hydrogel was both pH- and temperature-dependent, but was higher in nonbuffered water than in boric acid/citric acid/phosphate buffer under the same conditions. The optimal hydrogel could swiftly swell and deswell in neutral and acid solutions, respectively. Its potential application in drug delivery was examined using insulin and methylene blue as model payload drugs. Loading in a 50% (v v−1) ethanol solution gave a higher insulin loading level than in the buffer water. Insulin and methylene blue were both released at pH 6.8 but not at pH 1.2, but followed first order kinetics and the Higuchi equation, respectively.  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

"Effect of urea-extracted sericin on melanogenesis: Potential applications in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation  The Author(s) 2018.Background: Hyperpigmentation disorders such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation are major concerns not only in light-skinned people but also in Asian populations with darker skin. The anti-tyrosinase and immunomodulatory effects of sericin have been known for decades. However, the therapeutic effects of sericin on hyperpigmentation disorders have not been well documented. Methods: In this study, we used an in vitro model to study the anti-tyrosinase, tolerogenic, and anti-melanogenic effects of sericin on Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PEG)-stimulated melanocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and artificial skin (MelanoDerm™). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, conventional and immunolabeled electron microscopy, and histopathological studies were performed. Results: The results revealed that urea-extracted sericin has strong anti-tyrosinase properties as shown by a reduction of tyrosinase activity in melanin pigments both 48 h and 10 days after allergic induction with PEG. Anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-β were upregulated upon sericin treatment (10, 20, and 50 µg/mL), whereas production of allergic chemokines, CCL8 and CCL18, by DCs was diminished 48 h after allergic induction with PEG. Moreover, sericin lowered the expression of micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a marker of melanogenesis regulation, in melanocytes and keratinocytes, which contributed to the reduction of melanin size and the magnitude of melanin deposition. However, sericin had no effect on melanin transport between melanocytes and keratinocytes, as demonstrated by a high retention of cytoskeletal components. Conclusion: In summary, sericin suppresses melanogenesis by inhibition of tyrosinase activity, reduction of inflammation and allergy, and modulation of MITF function."
"Depressive, anxiety and hypomanic symptoms in schizophrenia may be driven by tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) patterning of IgA and IgM responses directed to TRYCATs  2017 Elsevier Inc.The aim of this study was to delineate the associations between the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway and affective symptoms in schizophrenia. Towards this end we measured immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgM responses to relatively noxious TRYCATs, namely quinolinic (QA), xanthurenic (XA), picolinic (PA) acid and 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), and generally protective TRYCATs, namely anthranilic (AA) and kynurenic (KA) acid in 80 patients with schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS) and anxiety (HAMA), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) as well as the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale of Schizophrenia (PANSS) were measured. Depression, anxiety and hypomanic as well as negative and positive symptoms were associated with increased IgA responses to PA. Increased IgA responses to XA were associated with anxiety, hypomanic and negative symptoms. Moreover, depressive, anxiety, hypomanic and negative symptoms were characterized by increased IgA responses to the noxious (XA + 3HK + QA + PA)/protective (AA + KA) TRYCAT ratio. All symptom dimensions were associated with increased IgM responses to QA, while depressive, anxiety, positive and negative symptoms were accompanied by lowered IgM responses to 3HK. Hypomanic symptoms were additionally accompanied by lowered IgM responses to AA, and negative symptoms by increased IgM responses to KA. In conclusion, both shared and distinct alterations in the activity of the TRYCAT pathway, as well as its regulatory factors and consequences, may underpin affective and classical psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Increased mucosa-generated production of noxious TRYCATs, especially PA, and specific changes in IgM-mediated regulatory activities may be associated with the different symptom dimensions of schizophrenia."
"Affective symptoms in schizophrenia are strongly associated with neurocognitive deficits indicating disorders in executive functions, visual memory, attention and social cognition  2017 Elsevier Inc.The aim of this study was to assess the neurocognitive correlates of affective symptoms in schizophrenia. Towards this end, 40 healthy controls and 80 schizophrenia patients were investigated with six tests of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), assessing spatial working memory, paired-association learning, one touch stocking, rapid visual information (RVP), emotional recognition test and intra/extradimensional set shifting. The Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HAMA) Rating Scales and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) as well as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were also used. There were highly significant associations between all 6 CANTAB tests and HDRS, HAMA and CDSS (except RVP) scores. The most significant items associating with neurocognitive impairments in schizophrenia were self-depreciation (CDSS), fatigue, psychomotor retardation and agitation, psychic and somatic anxiety (HDRS), fears, cognitive symptoms, somatic-muscular, genito-urinary and autonomic symptoms and anxious behavior (HAMA). The selected HDRS and HAMA symptoms indicate fatigue, fears, anxiety, agitation, retardation, somatization and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) and are therefore labeled “FAARS”. Up to 28.8% of the variance in the 6 CANTAB measurements was explained by FAARS, which are better predictors of neurocognitive impairments than the PANSS negative subscale score. Neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia are best predicted by FAARS combined with difficulties in abstract thinking. In conclusion, depression and anxiety symptoms accompanying the negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with neurocognitive deficits indicating disorders in executive functions, attention, visual memory, and social cognition. Neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia reflect difficulties in abstract thinking and FAARS, including subjective cognitive complaints."
"IDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity  2017 Elsevier Inc.Obesity and depression are among the most pressing health problems in the contemporary world. Obesity and depression share a bidirectional relationship, whereby each condition increases the risk of the other. By inference, shared pathways may underpin the comorbidity between obesity and depression. Activation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is a key factor in the pathophysiology of depression. CMI cytokines, including IFN-γ, TNFα and IL-1β, induce the catabolism of tryptophan (TRY) by stimulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) resulting in the synthesis of kynurenine (KYN) and other tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). In the CNS, TRYCATs have been related to oxidative damage, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytotoxicity, excitotoxicity, neurotoxicity and lowered neuroplasticity. The pathophysiology of obesity is also associated with a state of aberrant inflammation that activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a pathway involved in the detection of intracellular or environmental changes as well as with increases in the production of TRYCATs, being KYN an agonists of AHR. Both AHR and TRYCATS are involved in obesity and related metabolic disorders. These changes in the TRYCAT pathway may contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms in obesity. This paper reviews the role of immune activation, IDO stimulation and increased TRYCAT production in the pathophysiology of depression and obesity. Here we suggest that increased synthesis of detrimental TRYCATs is implicated in comorbid obesity and depression and is a new drug target to treat both diseases."
"The effects of pessimism on cell-mediated immunity in rats  2017 Elsevier Inc.We used a recently developed ambiguous-cue interpretation (ACI) paradigm to investigate whether ‘optimism’ and ‘pessimism’ as behavioural traits may be interrelated with immune functions in rodents. To this aim, in a series of ACI tests (cognitive bias screening, CBS), we identified rats that displayed ‘pessimistic’ and ‘optimistic’ traits. We found significant differences in immune biomarkers between ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ animals. Moreover ‘pessimism’ was associated with significantly lower relative weight of the spleen and thymus, significantly decreased proliferative activity of splenocytes. Pessimism was associated with an increased production of interleukin-(IL)1β and IL-4, activin A, L-selectin, interferon (IFN)-γ and some chemokines and receptors for advanced glycation endproducts. The findings indicate an inflammatory profile in “pessimistic” animals."
"Stimulatory effect of desipramine on lung metastases of adenocarcinoma MADB 106 in stress highly-sensitive and stress non-reactive rats  2017The effect of antidepressant drugs on tumor progress is very poorly recognized. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of individual reactivity to stress and 24-day desipramine (DES) administration on the metastatic colonization of adenocarcinoma MADB 106 cells in the lungs of Wistar rats. Wistar rats were subjected to stress procedure according to the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression for two weeks and stress highly-sensitive (SHS) and stress non-reactive (SNR) rats were selected. SHS rats were more prone to cancer metastasis than SNR ones and chronic DES treatment further increased the number of lung metastases by 59% and 50% in comparison to vehicle-treated appropriate control rats. The increase in lung metastases was connected with DES-induced skew macrophage activity towards M2 functional phenotype in SHS and SNR rats. Moreover, during 24 h after DES injection in healthy rats, the decreased number of TCD8+ and B cells in SHS and SNR rats as well as NK cell cytotoxic activity in SNR rats could be attributed to the lowered capacity to defend against cancer metastasis observed in chronic DES treated and tumor injected rats."
"Improvisation, thang, and Thai musical structure  2018 Musicological Society of Australia.Despite its centrality to Thai musical thought and practice, Thai and English-language scholars have been reluctant to use the term ‘improvisation’ to describe Thai music. This reluctance stems from a number of interrelated factors, including the incommensurability of terms and concepts in the Thai and Western musical systems, scholars’ lack of familiarity with Thai and/or Western musical structure, and the improvisatory practices associated with them, especially jazz, which is thought to exemplify improvisation, and lack of clarity in understanding the Thai musical concepts of prae, plae, and thang that underpin Thai musical thought and provide the context in which improvisation can, and in some cases must, occur. By laying out some general principles associated with improvisation, especially Pressing’s concept of the ‘referent’, and describing how these relate to Thai musical structure, thought, and practice, we clarify uncertainty about Thai music’s structure and performance processes. We show that in learning to perform, Thai musicians develop intimate knowledge of their musical system and the stylistic qualities of all instruments. Their training teaches them to think in terms that mirror the logic of the musical system and enables them to improvise in stylistically appropriate ways."
"Analysis of the complete mitochondrial genomes of two dwarf honeybee species, Apis florea and Apis andreniformis (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Apidae), in Thailand  2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The dwarf honeybees Apis florea and Apis andreniformis inhabit the bush and forests of continental Asia and north Africa and some islands of Sundaland and the Philippines. We analysed, for the first time, the complete mitochondrial genomes of two dwarf honeybee species from Thailand using next-generation sequencing. Each mitochondrial genome was a circular and approximately 17 kbp molecule that included 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, and two ribosomal RNA genes, along with one A + T-rich control region, besides three tRNA-Ser (AGN) repeats. The AT content values of the mitochondrial genomes of A. florea and A. andreniformis were 86.28% and 85.73%, respectively. The 1150 mutation sites in 13 PCGs differing between A. florea and A. andreniformis in Thailand were evenly distributed throughout their mitochondrial genomes. The phylogenetic relationship, inferred using 13 PCGs, was consistent with that reported in previous studies, which predicted a sister relationship between A. florea and A. andreniformis."
"Leadership, trust, proximity to government, and community-based enterprise development in rural Thailand  2018 Hong Kong Geographical Association.This article examines the relation between leadership, government, trust, and how community-based enterprises (CBEs) access markets. It argues that leadership styles, the relation with the government, and level of trust among members and networks lead to different patterns of market access of local community enterprises. Conducting field research and in-depth interviews with CBEs in northeastern, central, and southern Thailand, it was found that some CBEs establish their enterprises and networks and directly access markets without relying on the government. Meanwhile, other CBEs are more likely to rely on the government to establish their enterprises, to connect with other local enterprises, and to access markets. Leadership, trust within enterprises, and proximity to government agencies can explain the different paths of CBE market access. Instead of implementing a universal program for all CBEs, the government needs to be concerned with the specific characteristics of CBEs in order to respond directly to their needs."
"Refuge behaviour from outdoor thermal environmental stress and seasonal differences of thermal sense in tropical urban climate  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Thermal sensation affects body temperature regulation. As a starting point for behavioral body temperature regulation taken to improve from a poor thermal environment to a more pleasant environment, thermal sense of thermal environment stimulus is important. The poupose of this sutudy is to use the outdoor thermal environment evaluation index ETFe to quantify effects on thermal sensations of the human body of a tropical region climate with small annual temperature differences, and to examine seasonal differences in thermal sensation. It was found temperature preferences were lower in the winter season than in the dry season, and that a tolerance for higher temperatures in the dry season than in the winter season. It was found effects of seasonal differences of the thermal environment appear in quantitative changes in thermal sensations. It was found that effects of seasonal differences of the thermal environment do not greatly affect quantitative changes in thermal comfort."
"Highly Sensitive Detection of Salmonella typhimurium Using a Colorimetric Paper-Based Analytical Device Coupled with Immunomagnetic Separation  2017 American Chemical Society.Salmonella causes over a million foodborne illnesses per year in the United States resulting in more hospitalizations and deaths than any other foodborne bacterial pathogen. To help prevent outbreaks, a rapid, portable, sensitive, and reliable method for onsite detection of bacteria that can be used in different sample matrices would be beneficial. Herein, we present a colorimetric paper-based analytical device (PAD) combined with immunomagnetic separation (IMS) for detecting Salmonella typhimurium. IMS anti-Salmonella coated magnetic beads were applied to capture and separate bacteria from the sample matrix and preconcentrate it into small volumes before testing on paper. To directly detect S. typhimurium after IMS, a sandwich immunoassay was implemented into the procedure with β-galactosidase (β-gal) as the detection enzyme. Using the antibody/enzyme complex, we performed a colorimetric assay with chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) for bacteria quantification. The method was confirmed to be highly specific to S. typhimurium without interference from other pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli. Using this system, the limit of detection of S. typhimurium was found to be 102 CFU mL-1 in culturing solution without any pre-enrichment. In addition, distance-based detection where the concentration is read as the length of colored band formed on the reaction was also demonstrated. This assay had a detection limit of 102 CFU mL-1 for S. typhimurium, providing an instrument-free quantitative analysis alternative to spot tests, which require image analysis. Finally, the proposed platform was applied for detection of S. typhimurium in inoculated Starling bird fecal samples and whole milk with detection limits of 105 CFU g-1 and 103 CFU mL-1, respectively, and this is the first published paper-based detection method for S. typhimurium in bird feces and whole milk."
"Gold Nanorods Stabilized by Biocompatible and Multifunctional Zwitterionic Copolymer for Synergistic Cancer Therapy  2017 American Chemical Society.A zwitterionic copolymer between methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and methacrylic acid (MA), PMAMPC is introduced as a potential versatile polymeric stabilizer for gold nanorods (AuNRs). The MA units in the copolymer serve as built-in feature for multiple functionalization, namely introducing additional thiol groups as active sites for binding with the AuNRs and conjugating with doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer drug via acid-labile hydrazone linkage. The MPC units, on the other hand, provide biocompatibility and antifouling characteristics. The chemically modified PMAMPC can act as an effective stabilizer for AuNRs yielding PMAMPC-DOX-AuNRs with a fairly uniform size and shape with good colloidal stability. In vitro cytotoxicity suggested that PMAMPC can not only improve the AuNRs biocompatibility, but also decrease DOX toxicity to a certain extent. The PMAMPC-DOX-AuNRs were efficiently internalized inside cancer cells and localized in lysosomes, where DOX was presumably acid-triggered released as monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the combined photothermal-chemo treatment of cancer cells using PMAMPC-DOX-AuNRs exhibited a higher therapeutic efficacy than either single treatment alone. These results suggested that the PMAMPC-DOX-AuNRs could potentially be applied in pH-triggered drug delivery for synergistic cancer therapy."
"Carbon dioxide and methane emission rates from taxi vehicles in Thailand  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Due to the expansion of urban areas have been increasing levels of greenhouse gas emissions from taxi and passenger cars that use natural gas for vehicles (NGV) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) as alternative fuels. The objective of this study was to evaluate the CO2 and CH4 emission of NGV and LPG taxis with different times from their engine ages compared to those from passenger cars. The driving tests were conducted at three driving speed ranges in Bangkok, Thailand. No significant differences in the CO2 emission rates from taxis and passenger cars using either NGV or LPG (174.5–227.0 g/km) were found. However, NGV taxis emitted the highest CH4 at all driving speeds, with an average emission of 1.33 g/km, higher than that from the LPG taxis. Comparing between taxis and passenger cars, the NGV taxis emitted the highest of CO2 and CH4 (13.8 ton CO2-eq/y), followed by LPG taxis (12.5 ton CO2-eq/y). The results obtained in this study can be used to create a database that supports the decision-making on development projects and to control GHG emission in Thailand."
"The economics of altruism: The old, the rich, the female  2018 Taylor & Francis.This study examines whether people of different observed characteristics exhibit different degree of altruism. The article utilizes a National Mental Health Survey that gathered questions about respondents’ self-reported altruism along with their demographic, labor force, and income information. The empirical results revealed the following: (1) Older people are more altruistic. This could potentially be explained by the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST) that the older people shift towards emotion-related goals that can be internally rewarding in the present. (2) Higher-income people are more altruistic. This could potentially be explained by the fact that higher-income people could better afford to be more altruistic compared to lower-income people. (3) Women are more altruistic. This could potentially be explained by either biological evolution or social imposition. The main results are robust once the potential endogeneity problem of the income variable is mitigated by the use of the instrumental variable estimation method."
"Application of Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE as a rapid method for routine determination of Vibrio spp. in foods  2017 Elsevier B.V.The aim of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of PCR-DGGE and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE techniques for rapid detection of Vibrio species in foods. Primers GC567F and 680R were initially evaluated for amplifying DNA and cDNA of ten references Vibrio species by PCR method. The GC-clamp PCR amplicons were separated according to their sequences by the DGGE using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 45–70% urea and formamide denaturants. Two pair of Vibrio species, which could not be differentiated on the gel, was Vibrio fluvialis - Vibrio furnissii and Vibrio parahaemolyticus - Vibrio harveyi. To determine the detection limit, in the community of 10 reference strains containing the same viable population, distinct DNA bands of 3 species; Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio mimicus and Vibrio alginolyticus were consistently observed by PCR-DGGE technique. In fact, 5 species; Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio mimicus, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio fluvialis consistently observed by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE. In the community containing different viable population increasing from 102 to 105 CFU/mL, PCR-DGGE analysis only detected the two most prevalent species, while RT-PCR-DGGE detected the five most prevalent species. Therefore, Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE was also selected for detection of various Vibrio cell conditions, including viable cell (VC), injured cells from frozen cultures (IVC) and injured cells from frozen cultures with pre-enrichment (PIVC). It was found that cDNA band of all cell conditions gave the same migratory patterns, except that multiple cDNA bands of Plesiomonas shigelloides under IVC and PIVC conditions were found. When Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE was used for detecting Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the pathogen-spiked food samples, Vibrio parahaemolyticus could be detected in the spiked samples containing at least 102 CFU/g of this pathogen. The results obtained also corresponded to standard method (USFDA, 2004). In comparison with the detection of the Vibrio profiles in fourteen food samples using standard method, Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE resulted in 100%, 75% and 50% similarity in 3, 1 and 6 food samples, respectively."
"A non uniform bound for half-normal approximation of the number of returns to the origin of symmetric simple random walk  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Let (Xn) be a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables with (Formula presented.).

Kn is called the number of returns to the origin if (Formula presented.). Döbler (2015) showed that the distribution of Kn can be approximated by half-normal distribution and he also gave a uniform bound in terms of (Formula presented.). After that, Sama-ae, Neammanee, and Chaidee (2016) gave a non uniform bound in terms of (Formula presented.). Observe that, the exponent of z is 3. In this paper, we improve the exponent of z to be any natural number k which make the better constant than before."
"Comparative pharmacokinetics between madecassoside and asiaticoside presented in a standardised extract of Centella asiatica, ECa 233 and their respective pure compound given separately in rats  2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.1. ECa 233, the standardised extract of Centella asiatica, contains not less than 80% triterpenoid glycosides, in a madecassoside:asiaticoside ratio of 1.5 (±0.5):1. 2. The pharmacokinetic comparison of madecassoside and asiaticoside was performed in rats following intravenous and oral administration of ECa 233, or an equivalent dose of the individual compounds. Blood, tissues, urine and faeces were collected after dosing to determine drug and metabolite levels using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. 3. Our study demonstrated that plasma levels of madecassoside, and to a lesser extent asiaticoside, were higher after administration of ECa 233 than the corresponding values for the pure compounds. There was a bidirectional interconversion between asiaticoside and madecassoside consistent with the increased exposure of madecassoside and asiaticoside in ECa 233. 4. Both madecassoside and asiaticoside appeared to be widely distributed in several organs and metabolized extensively; following intravenous administration of either compound, approximately 80–90% of the dose was recovered as madecassic acid and asiatic acid in the faeces."
"Radiation Protection  Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.This chapter deals with radiation protection aspects of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) imaging techniques involving ionizing radiation. Due to stochastic effects and, at very high doses, tissue reactions caused by X-rays, radiation protection of patients, staff, and public should always be taken into account. Specifically, for patients, every exposure should be justified and optimized, by selecting the most appropriate imaging technique for individual patients and ensuring that the patient dose is as low as reasonably achievable. For staff and public, dose limits need to be adhered to."
"Factors affecting contraceptive utilization in Myanmar youth migrants in Samutsakhon province, Thailand  2018 Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.. All rights reserved.Purpose - Youths are becoming sexually active nowadays and the rate of pre-marital sex has been increasing all around the world. Youth migrants have to face several barriers in accessing reproductive health care services when compared with older migrants. This study aimed to identify the factors affecting the contraceptive utilization among Myanmar youth migrants in Samutsakhon province, Thailand. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study was conducted among 372 Myanmar youth migrants residing in Samutsakhon province, Thailand by using convenient sampling method. Data was collected by using self-administered questionnaires. Findings - Contraceptive utilization rate among Myanmar youth migrants was 59.7 %. The study found that significant factors associated with current use of contraception were education (p-value = 0.000), marital status p-value = 0.033), ever heard of contraception (p-value = 0.008), level of knowledge (p-value = 0.001), discussion with partners (p-value = 0.006), and peer pressure to use contraception (p-value = 0.001). Moreover, availability of contraceptive information (p-value = 0.037), availability of health education materials (p-value = 0.004), easy availability of contraception in need (p-value = 0.000), convenient opening hours (p-value = 0.000) and long waiting time (p-value = 0.001) had significant associations with current use of contraception in multivariate-analysis. Originality/value - Low level of contraceptive utilization rate means there is urgent need of health education among Myanmar youth migrants. Providing youth friendly health care services can help fulfill the needs of youth migrants who are vulnerable to sexual and reproductive health risks."

Originality/value - Community mobilization activities through volunteer malaria workers and government health staff are necessary to improve knowledge, attitude and practice regarding malaria prevention practice."
"Bedroom environment in relation to respiratory and asthma symptoms among urban primary school children in Thailand  2018 Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.. All rights reserved.Purpose - This study sought to examine the association between bedroom environments with respiratory and asthma symptoms among primary school children in urban area of Bangkok, Thailand. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study was conducted among 658 primary school children aged 6 to 10 years during April - May 2018. Self-reported questionnaire from child’s parent was used as a measurement tool. Children’s history of respiratory and asthma symptoms within 1 year was modified from International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). Binary logistic regression models were performed to find the associations. Findings - Running nose without cold symptom was the highest reported respiratory and asthma symptom in the past 12 months (52.7%). Having doll in bedroom was significantly associated with dry cough at night (AOR = 2.610; 95%CI 1.720-3.959), phlegm (AOR = 2.375; 95%CI 1.618-3.488), shortness of breath (AOR = 2.440; 95%CI 1.164-5.114), and running nose without cold symptoms (AOR = 2.265; 95%CI 1.558-3.291). Wall dampness near children’s bedroom was significantly associated with shortness of breath (AOR = 3.435; 95%CI 1.297-9.098), and running nose without cold symptoms (AOR = 2.331; 95%CI 1.034-5.257). Originality/value - Children’s bedroom environments including doll, window, and wall dampness were positive significantly associated with respiratory and asthma symptoms. Further intervention to improve child’s bedroom environment should be considered to reduce respiratory and asthma symptoms."
"Knowledge attitude and cultural factors toward utilization of insecticide treated nets (ITNS) among Rakhine ethnic group in Ann Township Rakhine State Myanmar: Cross sectional study  2018 Authors. All rights reserved.Purpose - Malaria is a life threatening disease; however, it can be prevented by the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs). It is crucial to understand knowledge, attitudes, utilization of ITNs, and cultural factors in order to eliminate malaria among people. This study aimed to find associations between general characteristics, knowledge, attitudes and cultural factors toward utilization of ITNs among Rakhine ethnic groups, Rakhine State, Myanmar. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study was conducted among 420 Rakhine ethnic groups, age from 18 years old and over. They were recruited from 10 villages in Ann Township, and were face to face interviewed in June, 2018. Chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression were employed to analyze association between dependent and independent variables. Findings - Only 3.6% of respondents had good level of knowledge, 19.0% good level of attitude, and 38.8% good level of practice towards utilization of ITNs. Factors associated with good practice were female participants (p-value <0.001, AOR 8.015, 95% CI=3.395-18.923), high school level (p-value <0.001, AOR 14.518, 95% CI=4.642-45.408), married participants (p-value <0.001, AOR 13.753, 95% CI=4.371-43.267), widowed participants (p-value 0.039, AOR 5.403, 95% CI=1.085-26.909), knowledge level (p-value <0.001, AOR 5.125, 95% CI=1.062-6.429). For cultural factors, participants who always worked from dawn to night time (p-value 0.032, AOR 2.203, 95% CI =1.070-4.536).

"Effect of different border migration patterns and factors related to malaria infection in Tanintharyi Region, Myanmar: A case-control study  2018 Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.. All rights reserved.Purpose - The study aimed to identify migration pattern of border migrant people and the factors associated with malaria infection in Myanmar-Thailand border area in Tanintharyi region, Myanmar. Design/methodology/approach - An unmatched case-control was conducted among 320 migrant people living in Dawei, Thayetchaung and Palaw Townships with 160 cases and 160 controls during March to May 2018. Cases and controls were confirmed by rapid diagnostic test. Data collection was done by using structure questionnaires through face to face interview. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed to determine the association between migration patterns and associated factors with malaria infection. Findings - More than half of respondents conducted inter-rural migration; and the rests were intermunicipal migration (19.4%) and inter-regional migration (27.8%). Inter-regional migration (crude OR=1.82, 95%CI=1.11-2.99), seasonal migration (crude OR=2.99, 95%CI=1.44-6.24) and non-contract migration (crude OR= 2.60, 95%CI=1.30-5.21) were risk factors for malaria at 5% significance level. Moreover, poor protective behavior (adjusted OR=8.85, 95%CI=2.82-27.80), difficult to access malaria health services (adjusted OR=34.28, 95%CI=4.37-268.48) were risk factors for malaria infection in multiple logistic regression at 95% CI. Originality/value - Malaria risk was varied with migration status and was influenced by protective behavior and ability to access malaria health services. Local health authorities should target high risk migrant people and provide easy available of malaria health services in Myanmar-Thailand border area."
"The Activity Profiles of Winning Male Amateur Boxers in the 2012 Olympic Games  2018, Journal of Exercise Physiology Online. All Rights Reserved.Wandee A, Benjapalakorn B. The Activity Profiles of Winning Male Amateur Boxers in the 2012 Olympic Games. JEPonline 2018;21 (3):183-192. The purpose of this study was to investigate activity profiles of winning male boxers competing under the modified official rules during the 2012 Olympic Games. The activity profiles were obtained via video footage of 75 boxing matches from the lightflyweight, flyweight, and bantamweight classes. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to identify differences of activity profiles among three rounds of boxing in each weight class. The results showed that winning boxers across all weight classes were able to maintained activity rates in most of the attack and defense related activity parameters. While light-flyweight boxers showed different rates of punching frequency in three rounds of fight, boxers in flyweight showed distinct footwork duration. Also, bantamweight boxers showed different numbers of jab and uppercut punches from round 1 to round 3. Despite the dissimilarity in boxing strategies, the results suggested boxers should be able to maintain their attacking and defending activities throughout all three rounds. Therefore, the coach and/or trainer should prepare training routines and fighting strategies that allow boxers to be consistently active the entire fight."

This study defined healthy aging as having totally independent physical function, normal cognitive function, good mental health status, normal nutritional status, and good quality of life. Findings - The prevalence of healthy aging was 66.0%. There were no differences in prevalence of healthy aging between males and females. After controlling for other covariates, household income, health awareness, physical activity, and sleep were associated with factors of healthy aging. Originality/value - About two-thirds of the older persons met the criteria of healthy aging. The findings of this study can be used as provisional data for policy makers to help Thailand overcome challenges that come with aging population."
"Epigenetics in Human Reproduction and Gynecologic Diseases  2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Studies on genetics and cell biology have revealed the details of cells in our body but have not yet succeeded in explaining the diversity in morphology and function that derive from the same genetic material after birth. It is widely accepted that DNA plays the role of transmitting the phenotypic information from parents to their offspring after fertilization (Wei et al., 2015). It has been shown that chronic human diseases, cancer, metabolic disorders, and gynecologic problems can be transmitted to their offspring through genetic mechanisms. However, the incidence of DNA aberrations that have been reported is very low, which contrasts with the incidence of the environmentally induced transgenerational inheritance diseases. In addition, most chronic ailments occur in late adult life, indicating that genetic mutation or aberration is not the basis for developing transgenerational inheritance diseases. On the other hand, more evidence supports the role of “epigenetics” of heritable phenotypic information from parents to offspring in causing further developments and diseases. This review focuses on epigenetic information in human reproduction since the beginning of life and the development of gynecological diseases, such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, hydatidiform moles, cervical cancer, and uterine leiomyoma, as well as therapeutic prospectives."
"Service Quality and Satisfaction of Traditional and Technology-Enhanced Services  2018, Academy of Marketing Science.Recent digital transformation continues to play a significant role in service industry. Competitive landscape has intensified as firms must continue to fight rivals from various fronts. With more technology-based self-service, how firms manage, measure, and maintain service quality and satisfaction have become a difficult issue. The nature of service industry employs multiple channels of service and tends to include both traditional offline and technology-based self-service. Thus, the effects of service quality leading to satisfaction between traditional and technology-enhanced services will be explored, and a new comprehensive online banking service quality measurement will be proposed. Comparison of service satisfaction and the effects of service quality on satisfaction among consumers with different levels of technology readiness and technology anxiety will also be conducted. The study found that empathy and reliability are the two most important dimensions in the traditional banking service, while assurance, responsiveness, and empathy are the most important dimensions in the technology-enhanced service. Technology readiness plays more important role in technology-enhanced service adoption. Magnitudes of service quality effects on satisfaction for all consumer groups within technology-enhanced service setting are similar. Managerial implications are proposed."
"Synthesis of Graphene Oxide Grafted with Epoxidized Natural Rubber via Aminosilane Linkage  2018 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.Graphene oxide was synthesized from graphite by Hummer method and connected with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane to form graphene oxide-aminosilane (GO-Si) linkage. The solution was centrifuged and washed with acetone to remove unreacted aminosilane before grafting with epoxidized natural rubber (ENR). ENR dissolved in toluene solution was mixed with GO-Si particle and dried at room temperature. Then, it was grafted to form graphene oxide grated with ENR via aminosilane linkage (GO-Si-ENR) by heat treatment. GO-Si-ENR was washed in toluene to remove unconnected ENR molecule. The synthesized GO particle in each step was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The possible reaction mechanism was proposed in this research. The aim of this synthesis is to improve natural rubber-graphene interfacial interaction thus the dispersion of GO and GO-Si-ENR particle in natural rubber matrix by solvent mixing process was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)."

The study aimed to assess the occurrence and risk factors associated with WMSDs among coffee harvesters in Chiang Rai, Thailand. Design/methodology/approach - This cross-sectional study was conducted in WMSDs among 272 coffee harvesters in Chiang Rai Province. The questionnaire was adapted from Standard Nordic Questionnaire; and the face-to-face interview was performed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Findings - The occurrence of 7-days and 12-months WMSDs were 79.4% and 81.6%; the most prevalent pains were in the areas of neck, shoulder and wrist. The risk factors that were significantly associated with 7-days WMSDs were age (OR=2.47, 95% CI=1.01-1.08), smoking (OR=2.85, 95% CI=1.22-7.36) and stress (OR=2.84, 95% CI=1.44-6.00) while the risk factors associated with 12-months WMSDs were age (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.10-4.32) and stress (OR=2.49, 95% CI=1.26-4.95). The work postures which were significantly associated with the nine body areas were twisting body, lifting arms above shoulders, and carrying heavy objects. Originality/value - This information can be used for further study to find the causal-effect relationship between WMSDs and risk factors; moreover, it helps as a guideline to implement future intervention and prevention program to reduce WMSDs."
"SYNTHESIS OF NATURAL RUBBER- BASED TOUGHENING AGENTS FOR POLY(LACTIC ACID)  2018. All Rights Reserved.Two types of modified natural rubber (NR) which are a low molecular weight hydroxyl terminated NR (HTNR) and its triblock copolymer with poly(lactic acid) (PLA), were synthesized and applied as toughening agents for PLA. The HTNR was achieved by depolymerization and hydroxylation using an ultraviolet radiation reaction. The HTNR with a hydroxyl functionality of 1.77±0.21 had a number-average molecular weight ((Figure presented)) of 28000 g/mol. Triblock copolymers of HTNR with 2 different low molecular weight PLA, PLA1 ((Figure presented) ≈ 3000) and PLA2 ((Figure presented) ≈ 9700 g/mol), were prepared by direct condensation polymerization. The formation of triblock copolymers was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR The toughening efficiency of the HTNR and its triblock copolymer on the mechanical and morphological properties for PLA was evaluated. The amount of NR, HTNR, and block copolymer in the blend was 10 percent by weight (%wt). The PLA/HTNR blend showed the highest impact strength and elongation at break. Compared to other blends, the PLA/PLA2-NR-PLA2 triblock copolymer blend showed the highest tensile strength. However, the value was still lower than that of neat PLA."

"Driving a Firm’s Agility and Success of Product Innovation Through Organizational Behavior: An Abstract  2018, Springer International Publishing AG.Many studies strive to explore the role of organization agility on the success of firms. Nonetheless, the way to increase an organization’s agility is not fully understood, especially in the new product development (NPD) process. Further, the outcomes of agility on the NPD process such as reducing fuzzy front end, enhancing innovativeness of firm, and improving new product performance are not yet clear. Drawing from concept of dynamic capabilities, using survey research, analyzing data with structural equation modeling, we expect that the results will help to describe how firms enhance the performance of new products through making an organization more agile."
"Factors influencing utilization of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy among mothers of under-one children in rural Lilongwe, Malawi  2018 Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.. All rights reserved.Purpose - Routine administration of Sulphadoxine Pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) of malaria during pregnancy leads to improvement of maternal health and pregnancy outcomes. This study explored determinants for IPTp-SP utilization among pregnant women in rural Lilongwe, Malawi. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-stage sampling method was used to recruit 355 mothers of under-one children. Face-to-face interview was conducted. Bivariate and multivariate statistical models were executed in analyzing data. Findings - Overall, 84.0% of the mothers attended at least 3 antenatal care (ANC) visits, effectively positioning themselves to the likelihood of receiving optimal IPTp-SP (3+ doses). Only 24.8% of the mothers received the recommended doses; 52.7% and 22.5% took partial and nil doses. Factors associated with IPTp-SP utilization included knowledge, attitudes, timing of ANC visit, frequency of ANC visits, health education, and perceived benefits of IPTp-SP. Client satisfaction with ANC services (AOR 1.94; 95% CI 1.07-3.51), and receipt of SP under health worker’ observation (AOR 6.96; 95% CI 2.04-23.71) increased the likelihood of optimal utilization. Originality/value - Despite high ANC attendance rate, optimal IPTp-SP utilization area is low. Apart from the identified client-level factors, this low coverage can be attributed to health workers’ non-adherence to IPTp-SP guidelines leading to missing opportunities. Program efforts should aim at addressing the identified knowledge gaps and reinforcing community trust in the intervention. Operational research is recommended to explore bottlenecks limiting effective coverage of the intervention."
"Residual levels of 17α-methyldihydrotestosterone in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fry following feeding supplementation  2018 The Author(s). This open access article is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 license.Intensive tilapia culture requires male-monosex population for its better yield and allowing more effective management of a single crop. Androgenic hormones are usually applied during the fish farming process to produce male-monosex population. This study investigated the residue of a synthetic androgenic steroid, 17α-methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT) after a course of feeding supplementation in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fry at a dose of 80 mg/kg feed for 15 and 23 consecutive days. An analytical method using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was developed to determine the residual MDHT in tilapia fry at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days after the last dose. The levels of MDHT on day 1 after hormone withdrawal were 3.198 ng/g in the 15-day treatment, and 3.224 ng/g in the 23-day treatment. MDHT was not detectable in fry after hormonal withdrawal for 5 days in both treatments (limit of quantitation, 0.95 ng/g), which suggests that negligible levels of MDHT will be present in Nile tilapia after 6–8 months hormonal withdrawal during the grown out period."
"Brugada Syndrome: Current Perspectives  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.Brugada syndrome was first reported as a distinct entity in 1992. It is diagnosed by signature EKG changes including at least 2-mm J-point elevation with coved-type ST elevation and T-wave inversion in at least one right precordial leads (type I Brugada marker). Initially thought of as a rare entity, Brugada syndrome is now widely recognized as a common cause of natural death among young men as a result of ventricular arrhythmia occurring at rest, particularly during sleep. The etiology of this disease is likely multifactorial, with genetic predisposition playing an important role in the pathogenesis. Mutation in the sodium channel gene SCN5A is seen in up to 20–25% of patients with at least 17 additional genes were reported to be associated with the disease. However, mutation in a single gene could be implicated in less than 30% of patients with Brugada syndrome, and a recent study showing association of this disease with common single nucleotide polymorphism of SCN5A, SCN10A, and HEY2 pointed toward polygenic or oligogenic pattern of inheritance rather than a single gene defect. Despite initial reports of normal structural heart in majority of patients, recent reports showed frequent minor structural abnormalities, especially in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in these patients. Brugada syndrome is now viewed as a spectrum of cardiomyopathy as well as channelopathy. The pathophysiologic underlying cardiac arrhythmia in Brugada syndrome is still unresolved with continued debate on depolarization versus repolarization defect. Treatment is largely dependent on the symptom with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation indicated in patients with severe symptoms. Avoiding medications and/or conditions that predispose the patient to ventricular arrhythmia is advised in all patients. Quinidine, by blocking transient outward current, has been used with some success. RF ablation of the epicardial substrate in the RVOT has been shown to prevent recurrence of ventricular arrhythmia in severe cases."
"Rights Can Coexist with Buddhism: A Buddhist Response to Ellen Zhang  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.My response to Ellen Zhang’s article in the book is that I argue that the conception of individual rights can coexist with the basic tenets of Buddhist philosophy that emphasize interdependence and compassion. Normally these two traits make it rather difficult to see how the individual rights, which are often regarded as presupposed by individuals as separate, autonomous entities, could be justified through a system of thought that emphasize just the opposite. However, if we imagine an ideal society where everyone acts as if they fully respect the rights of one another, we would see that the rights as expressly specified and written down are not necessary, as they are already implicit in the behavior of the members of the ideal society. According to the Buddhist viewpoint, such a society embodies the ideal of living together, where one is totally unselfish and is totally dedicated to the welfare of others. This society thus is morally perfect according to the Buddhist system of compassion and interdependence, and there is no need to emphasize the separate and autonomous nature of individuals in order to justify it. However, since the end result is the same, this ideal situation shows that it is possible that the individual rights regime can indeed coexist with Buddhism."
"Food, Technology, and Identity  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.Technology has become indispensable in all the processes of food and agriculture, whether we like it or not. This has created a tension between what we would like as ‘being natural’ and the reality of technology. Furthermore, food is intimately connected with identity; thus when technology comes in to play its role in changing the sense of identity with regards to food is an interesting phenomenon. I argue that technology does not have to destroy food identity as some scholars have claimed. On the contrary we can use technology even to enhance our identity, but there are many necessary conditions that have to be met before that can become a reality."

"Modification of the anaerobic digestion model No.1 (ADM1) for lignocellulosic biomass  2018 Society for Innovative Research. All rights reserved.The lignocellulosic biomass will be the resource for an alternative energy in the future. To evaluate the dynamical products from anaerobic digestion process such as sugars, VFA and gas product, the ADM1 model can be modified to apply for lignocellulosic biomass digestion. The selected lignocellulosic biomasses as Napier grass, empty palm fruit bunch and acacia leave which had different cellulose and lignin content was selected to research in this part. This difference between based and modified model was additional term as cellulose. The results depicted that the term of fiber and solubilization of biomass controlled anaerobic digestion process. The simulation results indicated that the modification model based on ADM1 model was able to describe the anaerobic digestion process from lignocellulosic biomass. The calibrated variable in the model was that the hard digestible content as cellulose (Xfi) was additional term in dynamic state variable in DAE system. The estimated value of cellulose hydrolysis rate constant (khyd,ce) was 0.01 d-1. The hydrolysis rate constant of easy digestible carbohydrates (khyd,ch), proteins (khyd,pr) and lipids (khyd,li) was calibrated to 0.03 d-1. The disintegration rate of lignocellulosic biomass (kdis) was calibrated to 0.025 d-1. The different by-products from various lignocellulosic biomass was the composition in substrate, which is validated as stoichiometric parameter (fcomposition,xc) in hydrolysis step in based model. The benefit of this work is to reduce the time and cost consuming in evaluating sugar, VFA and gas product from lignocellulosic biomass digestion."
"Comparison of soil composition between farmlands and conserved area  2018 Society for Innovative Research. All rights reserved.Thai farmers usually have low formal education and lack of knowledge on soil quality improvement and proper use of fertilizers. After a few years of farming, they try to trespass in conserved forest areas because of soil deterioration in their own limited expanses of farmland and they believe that soils in the conserved area are more fertile than soils in their own farms. Consequently, most of them are arrested, creating individual and family problems. This project will compare the physical and chemical properties of soils from farmlands and soils from the conserved area. The results showed that soil nutrients from both farmlands and soils from the conserved area were not significantly different in nearly all parameters of analysis except soils from the conserved area have more organic matters and nitrogen content. However, both soils from farmlands and conserved area were sandy loam which has low water content and low cation exchange capacity. The analysis data were informed to the farmers and suggested them to improve their farmlands using appropriate organic matters and suitable plants have to be chosen to match the sandy loam soil in order to get more productivity. Water supply management also has to be improved. However, mixed farming is another good planting method. Some kinds of plants can fix nitrogen in soil such as legumes. They can enrich soil nutrients. The most important issue is that farmers have to be acknowledged that soils in the conserved areas are not more fertile than soils in their farmlands. Therefore, in the future, farmers will not trespass conserve areas."
"An Overview of Coal Energy Sources and Supply in Thailand  2018. All Rights Reserved.This study introduces the key facts on the current proven reserves, production, sources, and supply of coal. The research provides an overview of the energy situation in Thailand; how the demand for coal and the clean coal activities being undertaken in Thailand. Coal production is currently a large industrial of energy source. In recent years Thailand's economy has grown rapidly, resulting in increased energy demand. This demand is met almost entirely by fossil fuels which provide 90% of the country's supply; gas makes up 70%, coal 20%, and there are some oil-fired plants. The remaining 10% comes mainly from hydroelectricity and other renewables. Several international institutions operating in Southeast Asia play an important role in contributing to the long-term energy strategy in Thailand. However, their work on promoting the use of clean coal technologies is limited in Thailand. The use of coal in Thailand will increase if all the planned new coal-fired power stations are built. Therefore, it is important that information on, and research into, the use of clean coal technologies within Thailand are supported and increased to better inform the wider community"

The water pool is equipped with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect the Cherenkov light from cosmic muons, acting as a veto detector. On top of the water pool is the top tracker to accurately measure the muon tracks. The Earth magnetic field (EMF) intensity at the experimental site is about 0.5 gauss which could have significant negative impact on the photoelectron collection efficiency of the large size PMTs. The compensation coils to minimize the effect of EMF on the PMTs is necessary to ensure the success of the experiment. A set of 16 pairs of circular coils forming a spherical shape surrounded the central detector has been studied by optimizing the coil current in order to achieve residual magnetic field in the CD region less than 10%. The effects of some installation misalignment and EMF secular variation are also studied."
"Occupational health for laboratory workers involved in the care and use of long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis)  2018, Chiang Mai University - Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. All rights reserved.Long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) play an important role in public health worldwide as they are often used in many drug and vaccine research studies. The recently established National Primate Research Centre (NPRC) of Thailand aims to breed a large number of Long-tailed macaque for research purposes. However, this breeding program may increases the risk of communicable diseases between the Long-tailed macaque population and NPRC staff. Currently, there are no specific occupational standards or guidelines for laboratory workers involved in the care and use of Long-tailed macaque. The creation of occupational health guidelines and recommendations for NPRC staff will be based on a thorough occupational health risk assessment process including information on currently known high risk pathogens. Based on current research, the major pathogens identified as a transmission risk from Long-tailed macaque to humans are B virus, simian retroviruses, hepatitis virus, rabies virus and tetanus; while tuberculosis, measles, influenza viruses and enteric bacterial pathogens comprise the highest risk of pathogens transfer from humans to Long-tailed macaque. In order to prevent these transmissions, appropriate vaccination programs for both humans and Long-tailed macaque population will be required, along with annual occupational health risk assessment reviews for NPRC staff and its operating practices. Achieving and maintaining optimal health and minimal risks for NPRC staff and Long-tailed macaque requires the collaboration of many occupations such as medical doctors, veterinarians, and support staff, jointly operating under the principle of One Health."
"Role of scoring systems in Wilson disease  2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Wilson disease (WD) is a multisystem metabolic disorder affecting mainly, but not only, the liver and the central nervous system. It can present with a wide variety of symptoms including acute liver failure with or without encephalopathy, neurological symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms. The diverse nature of presentation means that there is no single symptom, sign, or test that is diagnostic. A timely diagnosis is of paramount importance, particularly in acute liver failure, so that appropriate treatment may be initiated. Patients presenting with classic Wilsonian liver failure require liver transplantation. WD patients presenting with less distinctive acute liver failure and encephalopathy are likely to require liver transplantation. When encephalopathy is not present with liver failure, it is important to be able to predict which patients would benefit from transplantation and which would improve with medical treatment. For these situations and others, diagnostic and prognostic scoring systems have been developed."

More recently F¨uredi andWetzel showed that one corner of this rectangle can be clipped to form a pentagonal cover having area 0:11224 for this family of curves. Here we show that then the opposite corner can be clipped to form a hexagonal cover of area less than 0:11023 for this same family. This irregular hexagon is the smallest cover currently known for this family of arcs."
"Analysis of the Relation between Green Logistics Management Practices and Export Intensity for Thai Food and Drinks SMEs  Jungseok Research Institute of International Logistics and Trade. All rights reserved.This paper aimed to examine the relationship between green logistics management (GLM) practices and export intensity of Thai SMEs in food and drinks manufacturing. The research involved carrying out in-depth interviews with ten experts to shed light on factors of GLM practices. The authors used a questionnaire to survey the data amongst 89 SME exporters through purposive sampling with valid 52 responses. The managerial issues related to export intensity, GLM practices, with regards to whether firms followed ISO 14001 and whether they had an employee(s) responsible for environmental management. The findings suggest that greater GLM practices being applied lead to higher export intensity in SME. The results indicate that most SMEs apply GLM practices in all dimensions to gain the benefits from the export market. It also emerged that those following ISO 14001 and/or having an employee(s) were associated with having higher export intensity than those who did not engage in these practices."
"Mediation effect of organizational identification on the relationship between person-organization fit and affective commitment to the political party  2018, Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute. All rights reserved.In the past twenty-five years, numerous studies have been conducted investigating the precursors of employees’ affective commitment to an organization. Nevertheless, most of this research has been studied within the context of public and private organizations, and research on organizational commitment for voluntary jobs is still scarce in a Thai context. The current study sought to extend the boundary of affective commitment by researching membership to political settings (for example, the Democrat Party, Thailand), and the ‘Youth democrat’. Young democrats volunteer for membership of the political party without monetary reward. Participants in the study were young democrats, recruited from the Democrat party, Thailand (N = 228). In the current sample, 67.1 percent of the young democrats were male and 32.5 percent were female and their average age was 21.50 years with SD = 1.86. A simple random sampling technique was employed. The results of the path analysis showed a good fit to the empirical data for the mediation model using the three variables of person-organization fit, organizational identification, and affective commitment (χ2 = 2.757, df = 1, p =. 097, CFI =. 995, GFI =. 994, RMSEA =. 088). Organizational identification mediated the relationship between person-organization fit and affective commitment and the indirect effect of person-organization fit on affective commitment was also significant (indirect effect =. 281, p <. 001)."
"Multi-Dependent Criteria Supplier Selection with Uncertain Performance Evaluation  Jungseok Research Institute of International Logistics and Trade. All rights reserved.Nowadays businesses tend to compete with rivals by improving capability to meet customer demands. One of the key to improve logistics efficiency of a firm is to select appropriate supplier. In the past, to select the most suitable supplier, most people evaluated performance by using average performance or variance from historical data but did not mentioned skewness. In other words, skewness impact on supplier performance is ignored by researchers and buyers. In fact, supplier with greatest average performance does not confirm to be the most suitable one because of uncertainties which make its performance skew either to the left or right, i.e., lower or higher than expectation. Therefore, this empirical study aims to discover and determine the important role of skewness on supplier selection problem. After identifying influential criteria on supplier selection, we analyze skewness effect on suppliers’ performance in each criterion by surveying real data of suppliers’ performances. Skewness effect can be rated in 3 levels; no effect, moderately effect, and highly effect. The results show that, there is only one criterion with no skewness effect, which is price. Criteria which have high skewed performance, for both of medium-sized and large-sized buyers, are lead time, product quality and reliability, and on-time delivery. Also, skewness has higher effect on suppliers’ performance of medium-sized buyers than large-sized buyers. The conclusion surprisingly shows that, skewness is the best index to distinguish between good and bad suppliers, while mean is the worst index."
"A study of multi-component ion exchange by ammonium ion during low salinity waterflooding in sandstone formation  2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers. All rights reserved.Ammonium ion which is a positively charged polyatomic cation has been widely used as clay control agent. As this ion has similar characteristics to potassium ion including ionic diameter and hydration number, ammonium ion should be able to displace divalent ion bridging between oil and rock surface during Multi-component Ion Exchange (MIE) mechanism as same as potassium ion. This study is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of ammonium ion compared to potassium ion and sodium ion. The result shows that both ammonium ion and potassium ion which are similar in hydrated properties can displace divalent ion better than sodium ion as well as deionized water. From coreflood experiment, there is a relationship between number of divalent ions in effluent and oil recovery factor. The higher the amount of divalent ions in effluent, the more oil is recovered. It is also observed that portion of calcium ion expelled from rock surface is increased when monovalent is present in injected water. From this study, it can be concluded that hydrated properties of monovalent ion in injected water affects the MIE mechanism. Small amount of ammonium ion can be added into injected water to improve the effectiveness of the mechanism."
"Urban agrarian and spatial development policy: The survival of an environmental agentin bangkok metropolitan region  2018, Chung Hua University. All rights reserved.Thailand has a long history of agricultural land policy since the first establishment of the former Kingdom in the 13th century. Most of the early day policy is to manage the land around the capital area. Bangkok Metropolitan Region has been formed to follow agricultural export policy since the 19th century. To explain what has happened to suburban farmland and urban agrarian families is to understand what influences the policy has on land and people. The paper is to review the former agricultural land policies and agricultural support programs of Thailand, and to investigate what could lead to environmental impact and impact on agricultural households as environmental agent. The review found that the export activities along with agricultural support program shaped today Bangkok agricultural land without proper protecting mechanism for farming environment."
"Clean coal project: Carbon certificate pricing Copyright  2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.New ultra super-critical coal power plants are proposed to be built in southern Thailand. In this paper, I am comparing different levelised cost of energy in per megawatt-hour for an old and new technology clean coal power plant to other electricity producing power plants. A hypothetical carbon certificate price per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is estimated that relates the extra cost of this new coal power plant to the cheapest but dirtiest option, a lignite power plant. The results show that the Thai government is willing to subsidize the abatement of air pollution. Furthermore, renewables keep being more expensive even after including the external costs of air pollution, except for onshore wind energy. However, no comment can be made which option should be strictly preferred as the electricity price and the environmental costs are only part of the political decision for a country on which fuel mix to choose."
"The land snail genus macrochlamys gray, 1847 from thailand, with descriptions of five new species (Pulmonata: Ariophantidae)  National University of Singapore.The taxonomic status of the limacoid genus Macrochlamys Gray, 1847 in Thailand has long been plagued by much ambiguity due to the inability to distinguish members from each other, and a few other genera, by shell morphology alone. The taxonomy of the Thai species is evaluated resulting in recognition of seven species, including five new species. The new species, Macrochlamys aurantia, M. coleus and M. tanymentula from Kanchanaburi Province (West Thailand), and M. caverna and M. lemma from Lopburi Province (Central Thailand), are distinguished and described based on shell, animal colouration, radula and genitalia characters. The status of Macrochlamys brunnea Möllendorff, 1902b is at present unclear. Although described from Bangkok, no material identifiable as this species was found in recent extensive surveys and it is provisionally retained in the genus without anatomical evaluation. Macrochlamys kelantanensis Möllendorff, 1902a is re-described with additional morphological and anatomical information. The five new species appear to have a restricted distribution in Western and Central Thailand, whereas M. kelantanensis is more wide-ranging, from Thailand to Malaysia. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of the shell morphology, external morphology, genital anatomy and radulae are provided. The results show that despite the shells being morphologically similar, aspects of classical morphology based taxonomy for Macrochlamys species, especially the genitalia morphology, remain useful and reliable for species delimitation."
"The association between new generation oral contraceptive pill and the development of inflammatory bowel diseases  2018. Korean Association for the Study of Intestinal Diseases.Background/Aims: To examine the association between use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) and the risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), in a modern cohort. Methods: A prospective nested case-control study across sites in the Asia-Pacific region was conducted; involving female IBD cases and asymptomatic controls. Subjects completed a questionnaire addressing questions related to OCP use. Primary outcome was the risk of development of IBD of those exposed to OCP versus non-exposure. Secondary outcomes were development of Crohn's disease (CD) versus ulcerative colitis (UC), and whether age of first use of OCP use may be associated with risk of IBD. Results: Three hundred and forty-eight female IBD cases (41% CD, median age: 43 years) and 590 female age-matched controls were recruited. No significant association was found between OCP use and the risk of IBD (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-3.13; P=0.22), CD (OR, 1.55) or UC (OR, 1.01). The lack of association persisted when results were adjusted for age and smoking. IBD cases commenced OCP use at a younger age than controls (18 years vs. 20 years, P=0.049). Conclusions: In this large cohort of subjects from the Asia-Pacific region, we found a modest but not significantly increased risk of developing IBD amongst OCP users."
"Immunogenicity and Adverse Reactions to Biosimilar Erythropoietin Products in Thailand: The Significance of Science and Quality Driven Process for Approval  2018, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.The immunogenicity of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEpo) by subcutaneous exposure has been well described. This adverse immunological effect causes anti-r-HuEpo-associated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). There have been increasing cases of anti-r-HuEpo-associated PRCA after subcutaneous exposure in Thailand. The casual mechanism of this disease may relate to HLA immunogenic, protein aggregation, stability during storage and handling of drug products, formulation and drug product quality. The r-HuEpos have been licensed for treatment of renal anemia in Thailand include innovator products and more than 20 biosimilar products. Lack of a scientific product characterization and quality driven process to approve such biosimilars may lead to different immunogenicity and safety profiles. The Prospective Immunogenicity Surveillance Registry of r-HuEpo with Subcutaneous Exposure in Thailand estimated the incidence of anti-r-HuEpo associated PRCA among subjects who had subcutaneous exposure to any r-HuEpo product currently available in Thailand, addressed the risk of anti-r-HuEpo-associated PRCA, and the association of product qualities towards adverse immunogenicity. The experiences of biosimilar r-HuEpo in Thailand and anti-rHuEpo associated PRCA in Thailand illustrated the need to evaluate biosimilar product on a case-by case basis. Considering patients ‘safety as the first priority, the approval process for biosimilar drug licensing should be designed to assess quality, characterization and impurity profile and comprehensive evaluation of the non-clinical and clinical aspects. Pharmacovigilance could be the final step to narrow the gap between quality and safety and can be assessed in totality with cost-effectiveness and patient benefit that such drug offer."
"Seroprevalence of Melioidosis in Sheep and Goats from Selected Small Ruminant Farms in Selangor, Malaysia  2018. Abba et al. All Rights Reserved.This study was designed to investigate the seroprevalence of Melioidosis in sheep and goats from selected small ruminant farms in Selangor, Malaysia. Blood samples (n=100) were collected each from sheep and goats using a random sampling technique from these farms. The serum samples were subjected to Melioidosis antibody screening using the Complement Fixation Test (CFT). The overall prevalence of Melioidosis among goats and sheep from these farms were 1% and 0%, respectively. It is concluded that although the prevalence of positive detection is low, there is need for further diagnostic surveillance as this singular case can be a potential reservoir for zoonotic infection."

"Beyond “bullies” and “victims”: A systemic approach to tackling school bullying  2005 by Lynn Greenwood.This chapter focuses on bullying in schools and draws on research from both developmental and organizational perspectives. It demonstrates that by working on the whole school system, bullying not only decreases but, in a parallel process, “bullies” as well as “victims” receive support. Research typically examines characteristics of bullies and victims and offers explanations that draw on theories of, among others, aggression and personality. Only bullies, victims, and uninvolved children participated. The results showed, once again, that bullies often had no biological father at home. Children are not bullies or victims in the same way as they are blond or brown. Children have bullying or passive behaviours that make them act the role of bully or victim within a group. The intervention is to reinforce positive alternative relational strategies and behaviours, more pro-social and cooperative to those that all pupils, bullies, bystanders, and sometimes even victims are used to."
"Fault identification usingcombined adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and Gustafson-Kessel algorithm  2018 University of Kuwait. All rights reserved.Issueson detecting the occurrence of a fault, justifying the type, and estimating the exact location of the faultshould be resolved to eliminate faults promptly and restore power supply with minimum interruption. Conventional approaches have contributed toassisting power utility in overcomingthese issues. However, these approaches rely on line parameters and involve a few complex mathematical equations. In this paper, a new method for fault identification pertinent to classification and location is proposed by utilizing the combined adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering algorithm. The effectiveness and practicability of this method aredemonstrated by the simulation results. This method uses the GK fuzzy clustering algorithm to decide on the premise configuration and its parameter and identifies itssucceeding parameter usingthe orthogonal least square. The proposed method is independent of the line parameter information and obtains high accuracy on estimation of fault locations."
"Heterogeneous Suzuki cross-coupling reaction in water catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles supported on individual calcium carbonate plates derived from mussel shell particle  2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.A new palladium nanoparticles catalyst supported on individual calcium carbonate plates (Pd/ICCP) is made from Asian green mussel shells and used as heterogeneous catalyst in Suzuki cross coupling reaction. The reduction of palladium (II) generates palladium (0) nanoparticles which can embed on individual calcium carbonate plates (ICCP) to give Pd/ICCP. The prepared Pd/ICCP catalyst is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), indicating an entire dispersion of palladium onto the surface of individual calcium carbonate plates. Furthermore, palladium content in the prepared Pd/ICCP catalyst is determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The optimized study is investigated in Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 4-iodoanisole and phenylboronic acid. It reveals that using potassium carbonate in mixed solvent of EtOH: H2O (3:2) in the presence of 2 mol% of Pd/ICCP give 4-methoxybiphenyl in 90% isolated yield at 40 oC. Moreover, in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as phase transfer agent, the reaction can perform in water as a sole solvent to give the product in excellent yield under the same condition."
"Classification of plant-and animal-based glycerin by using ATR-FTIR: A rapid screening tool applicable for halal cosmetics  2018, Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association. All rights reserved.The aim of this study was to develop the rapid method for classification of animal-based glycerin (AG) and plant-based glycerin (PG). Palm, soybean and coconut oil were used for PG production whereas the AG was prepared from lard and chicken fat. All glycerin types were produced according to the biodiesel production process using sodium hydroxide, ethanol and oil. After extraction, crude glycerin was analyzed by Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopic technique. Our results from cluster analysis revealed that two spectral bands of 864-895 cm-1 and 1,020-1,099 cm-1 were successfully to be used for classification among PG, AG, synthetic and commercial glycerin. Moreover, the ratios of band area of 864-895 cm-1 and 1,062-1,100 cm-1 normalized by that of 1,020-1,060 cm-1 in AG were significantly greater than those of PG. From the study, it can be concluded that plant-and animal-based glycerin can be well classified by using two IR spectral bands from ATR-FTIR analysis. The present technique could be a rapid screening tool for the Halal cosmetic laboratory to screen and monitor the Halalness of the glycerin. This finally increased the Muslim consumers’ spiritual confidence in Halal cosmetic products."
"Factors influencing immunisation schedule adherence and completion at the regional level in the Philippines Copyright  2018, Kesmas: National Public Health Journal.The leading causes of infant deaths are largely preventable and there are reasons from both the supply and the demand sides of healthcare why they may be perpetuating. This study aimed to ascertain factors affecting the preventive healthcare behaviour of immunisation of infants in the Philippines which is timely because completion, or adherence, rate had plateaued in recent decades. The method employed was the creation of statistical models at sub-national level. The sample contained infants born prior to the 2013 Philippines National Demographic and Health Survey to determine proper adherence to the government-mandated immunisation schedule. This involved merging the 17 administrative regions of the country to the traditional three sub-national regions. It is observed that the higher maternal education level and improved household socioeconomic status were the most indicative factors of improved adherence across all regions. This is also the case to some extent with more advanced maternal ages at giving birth. Autonomy of mothers to visit healthcare facilities depicts conflicting relations for different regions as well as how mothers behave depending on the nature of intention to give birth. These aspects regarding predictive factors of preventive care have yet to be studied keenly at the regional level in the Philippines."
"Strategy, choice of performance measures and use of performance measurement systems: Empirical evidence from Thailand  2018, Universita Putra Malaysia.This paper examines how firms design and use performance measurement systems to support their strategy. In particular, the study investigates linkages between business strategy (i.e. cost leadership, differentiation and mixed strategy) and relative weights placed on different groups of performance measures and ways in which performance measurement systems are used (i.e. diagnostically or interactively). Drawing on data collected from 93 firms listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and Market for Alternative Investment (MAI), the study reveals that 46 out of 93 firms (49.46%) pursue mixed strategy. The results indicate that firms place an emphasis on strategy-consistent performance measures only to a certain extent. Overall, high emphasis is placed on financial and market and quality-related measures regardless of their strategy. With regard to the use of performance measurement systems, firms place greater emphasis on diagnostic use than on interactive use regardless of their strategy."
"Impact of increased vehicle weight on energy consumption of diverse powertrain options under real-world driving in Bangkok Copyright  2018 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc. All rights reservedThe present study investigated the changes of the energy consumption under increased laden weight in traffic conditions of Bangkok for C-segment passenger cars. The vehicles were loaded 10, 20 and 30% of its design weight. Based on the vehicle specific power method, the results showed that the energy consumption for ICEV increases strongly once the laden weight reaches 20 and 30%. EV is much less sensitive. In terms of the total cost of ownership, from a slightly higher cost of EV at the baseline, when the weight increase reaches 30%. the use of EV yields 5% advantage over ICEV."
"Information embedding in 3D printed objects using metal-infused PLA and reading with thermography  2018 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.Digital fabrication has the potential to innovate manufacturing and logistics in the near future. An attempt to increase the value of real fabricated objects by embedding information and including copyright protection is often proposed. We present a new technique for embedding information using metal fused materials (Copper powder-infused PLA) to form a fine structure inside the 3D printed objects. Then, information can be detected nondestructively by thermography. Our experiment proved that a binary code array of metal-infused material can be successfully printed and embedded inside a sample of fabricated 3D based objects (ABS). In the thermal image, the implanted structure areas were clearly observed with temperature conditions different from the surroundings. We also studied the factors that influence the quality of readouts, such as how deeply infused-metal is embedded from the surface, the colors of the filament substances, and the clearance of the image binary code compared to previous methods. The best condition was embedding metal-infused material 1 mm deep from the surface. Moreover, the color of the printing filament had no effect on the quality of the read-out information. These results mean that we can increase the value added to various kinds of objects fabricated with 3D printers more conveniently."
"Indonesian students’ reasons for choosing to study nursing: A phenomenological study  Unisa Press 2019Many Indonesian nurses face uncertain placement owing to the low absorptive capacity of the public and private sector health facilities, which may influence new students to choose nursing as a career. Thus, determining students’ reasons for choosing to study nursing remains important to help nursing educators develop programmes to retain them in the nursing profession. This study aimed to determine why new students choose to enter the nursing profession. This was a phenomenological study using focus group discussions with twenty nursing diploma students who were selected to participate in this study at the beginning of their first year of study. Van Manen’s thematic analysis method was used for the data analysis. The findings revealed five themes associated with the reasons to study nursing among Indonesian students, namely (i) conscience to help family and others, (ii) inspiration by nurses, (iii) desire to improve the nursing image, (iv) parental and family influence, and (v) opportunities to work and study abroad. These findings help nursing educators to further understand what drives students, which can be used to improve retention strategies for upcoming and future nursing generations in Indonesia."
"Development and implementation of GNSS technology and DFMC 2nd generation of SBAS in Thailand  2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018. All rights reserved.Currently, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that is being used commonly by general usershas a positioning accuracy around five meters. This level of accuracy might be sufficient for general GNSS usersand their applications. However, in case of air transportation sector, this sector usually requires higher standards interms of precision, accuracy, integrity and reliability. It is crucial to obtain higher positioning performance, whichthe current single GNSS constellation could not fulfill the standards as defined by the International Civil AviationOrganization (ICAO). In addition, Thailand is located at a low-latitude region where there is higher ionized particledensity in the atmosphere. This affects the signal from navigation satellite and induce the localizing error. In orderto improve the performance and correct the errors due to these effects, the GNSS augmentation systems, i.e. AircraftBased Augmentation Systems (ABAS), Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) and Satellite BasedAugmentation Systems (SBAS) have been introduced and implemented specially for the aviation activities. Thispaper presents the testing and validation of the second generation SBAS system in Thailand. The recent systemmakes use of the dual frequency, multi-constellation (DFMC) methodology, which could lead to a significantimprovement over the first generation SBAS system and requires less investment for the ground stationinfrastructure. At present, the testbed is being installed in Thailand. Preliminary results of the DFMC 2nd generationSBAS will be presented in this paper."
"Tensor network study of two dimensional lattice ϕ4 theory  Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons.The tensor renormalization group attracts great attention as a new numerical method that is free of the sign problem. In addition to this striking feature, it also has an attractive aspect as a coarse-graining of space-time; the computational cost scales logarithmically with the space-time volume. This fact allows us to aggressively approach the thermodynamic limit. While taking this advantage, we study the critical coupling of the two dimensional ϕ 4 theory on large and fine lattices. We present the numerical results along with the extrapolation procedure to the continuum limit and compare them with the previous ones by Monte Carlo simulations."
"Antimicrobial resistance of campylobacter spp. And arcobacter butzleri from pets in Malaysia  2018 Mohammed Dauda Goni, Abdinasir Yusuf Osman, Saleha Abdul Aziz, Zunita Zakaria, Gurmeet Kaur Dhaliwal, Muhammad Ibrahim Jalo, AsinamaiAthliamai Bitrus, Saleh Mohammed Jajere and Muhammad Adamu Abbas.The emergence of antimicrobial resistance in pets is not well understood and methods of surveillance are only beginning to be established in a few countries. The consequence of antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter and Arcobacter butzleri to public health is due to the propensity of the bacteria to swiftly acquire and disseminate resistance gene. Thus, making way for the emergence of new and very pathogenic clones resulting to difficulty in treatment with antimicrobials. The objectives of this study were to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and multidrug-resistant (MDR) profiles of Campylobacter and Arcobacter butzleri isolated from dogs and cats and to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance using the disc diffusion test and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration. Ninety four (94) Arcobacterbutzleri and 28 Campylobacter isolates were tested against 12 antimicrobials using the disc diffusion method namely Ciprofloxacin (Cip) 5µg; Ampicillin (Amp), 10 µg; Tetracycline (Te), 30 µg; Erythromycin (E), 15 µg; gentamicin (CN), 10 µg; Cefotaxime (CTX), 30 µg; Penicillin G (P), µg; Streptomycin (S), µg; nalidixic acid (NA), µg; Enrofloxacin (Enr), µg; Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (AMC), µg and Ceftazidine (CAZ), µg. Using the M.I.C.E. strip, Campylobacter and A. butzleri isolates showed the exception in the resistance to ciprofloxacin. In comparison, the resistance rates between the disc diffusion and M.I.C. were not significantly different. The resistance patterns showed 18 and 35 antibiotypes for Campylobacter and Arcobacterbutzleri isolates respectively. Campylobacter isolates were found resistant to 9 antimicrobials while Arcobacter butzleri showed resistance to 10 antimicrobials. MDR was reported among 50% and 78.9% of Campylobacter and Arcobacterbutzleri isolates respectively. Antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter and Arcobacter butzleri not only increase the risk of treatment failure in both human and animals but also spread antimicrobial resistance genes. Thus, the presence of Campylobacter in pets could be a potential source of human infections and environmental contamination."
"An evaluation of anonymized models and ensemble classifiers  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.This study evaluates the performance of privacy models and ensemble classification algorithms for data anonymization on classification. Data mining is continuously used in various purposes to extract knowledge. It is necessary for us to concern about privacy to prevent the result from disclosing identity of persons. Data anonymization has emerged with the objective of reducing re-identification risk. However, when data anonymization is applied, the data utility may decrease. Therefore, it is necessary to trade-off between privacy risks and the data utility. Our objectives in this research are to evaluate the effects of data classification with anonymized data and to evaluate the performance of various privacy models and ensemble classification algorithms. The measurement metrics in this experiment are accuracy, re-identification risk and suppressed records. Our experimental results show that there is no significant difference between the accuracy of classification using original data and the accuracy of classification using anonymized data. In addition, the average accuracy of each algorithm is not significantly different."
"Influence of achievement goals and academic self-efficacy on academic achievement of Thai undergraduate students: Across non procrastinators and procrastinators  University of Almería and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).Introduction. Procrastination is a very interesting topic because even if procrastinators could anticipate the negative consequences, they still intentionally do necessary tasks with delay. This may be because some procrastinators receive positive outcomes referred to active procrastinator, but some are not called passive procrastinator. Verifying the motivational belief moderates these two different types of procrastination; therefore, this study evaluates consistency of two different configurations. Model 1 is based on achievement goal theory integrated factors between academic self-efficacy and achievement goal (achievement goals→academic self-efficacy→academic achievement). Model 3 is based on social cognitive theory of motivation separated factors between achievement goal and academic self-efficacy (academic self-efficacy, achievement goals→academic achievement) across the three groups of procrastinators (non-procrastinators, active-procrastinators, and passive procrastinators). Moreover, this study investigated the different patterns of structural relations (including both direct and indirect relationship) between the achievement goals, academic self-efficacy and academic achievement. Method. The sample consisted of 988 Thai undergraduate students with an average age of 20 (SD = 0.99) ranging from 18 to 27 years. Structure equation model was employed to test the path model and Multi-group path analyses were used to verify differences in the path coefficients across the three types of procrastinators. Results. The finding confirmed that with Model 1 there were a higher number of significant relationships that integrated achievement goals and academic self-efficacy pertaining to academic achievement than with the Model 3 which separated achievement goal and academic self-efficacy relative to academic achievement, as well as across the three types of procrastinators. Discussion and Conclusion. There was a substantial result of the importance of integration between academic self-efficacy and achievement goals for passive procrastinators showing in Model 1 that academic self-efficacy mediated relationships between achievement goals and academic achievement for the passive procrastinators but not the active-procrastinator or non-procrastinator groups. The implications of the findings across the three groups of procrastination are discussed."
"The phenomenology of supernatural belief: The ravenous spirit (phii pob) belief tradition in contemporary northeast thailand  Nanzan University Anthropological Institute.Classic anthropological studies construe magic as a body of propositions and practices concerning natural laws that, though approximating science in several respects, is founded on a false assessment of reality. Per this outlook, magic is a set of fallacious premises and practices in contradistinction to well-grounded and empirically verified science. Examining the ravenous spirit (phii pob) belief tradition practiced by several rural communities in contemporary northeast Thailand, this paper revisits the status of magical beliefs vis-à-vis science. An inquiry into experiences convincing believers of the reality of ravenous spirits reveals that the ravenous spirit tradition, like science, is 1) a body of propositions and practices anchored to a rational assessment of empirical evidence, and 2) a speculation on the possible causes of a phenomenon, inferred from its manifested effect, which is inevitably partial."
"Quantitative finite strain analysis of the quartz mylonites within the three pagodas shear zone, Western Thailand  2018 Pitsanupong KANJANAPAYONT et al., published by Sciendo.The NW–trending Three Pagodas shear zone exposes a high–grade metamorphic complex named Thabsila gneiss in the Kanchanaburi region, western Thailand. The quartz mylonites within this strike–slip zone were selected for strain analysis. 2–dimensional strain analysis indicates that the averaged strain ratio (Rs) for the lower greenschist facies increment of XZ– plane is Rs = 1.60–1.97 by using the Fry’s method. Kinematic vorticity analysis of the quartz mylonites in the shear zone showed that the mean kinematic vorticity number of this increment is Wk = 0.75–0.99 with an average at 0.90 ±0.07. The results implied that the quartz mylonites within the Three Pagodas shear zone have a dominant simple shear component of about 72% with a small pure shear component. A sinistral shear sense is indicated by kinematic indicators from macro– to micro–scale. We conclude that the Three Pagodas shear zone deformed in the process of sinstral shear–dominated transpression, which is similar to the Mae Ping shear zone in the north."
"Synthesis of PET-PLA copolymer from recycle plastic bottle and study of its applications in the electrochromic devices with graphene conductive ink  2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In this study, waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottle was depolymerized using excess ethylene glycol (EG) in the presence of cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate ((CH3COO)2Co·4H2O) as a catalyst. It was found that the reacted products consist mainly of bis-2-hydroxy ethylene terephthalate (BHET) monomer. Poly(ethylene terephthalate)poly(lactic acid) (PET-PLA) copolymers were synthesized by the reaction of BHET with L-lactic acid (LLA) monomers using the catalytic system. The samples were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The 1H and 13C NMR studies confirm the incorporation of lactate units in PET chains after reaction. Further, we report the use of graphene conductive ink and PET-PLA as the electrochromic (EC) device. Copolymer film was coated with graphene ink by spin coating method. Our results primarily indicate that the configuration presents an easy and expeditious way."
"Hybrid Monitoring of Chip Formation and Straightness in CNC Turning by Utilizing Daubechies Wavelet Transform  2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.The relations of straightness, chip formation, and cutting forces are investigated during the CNC turning process. Utilizing the Daubechies wavelet transform, the dynamic cutting forces are decomposed to classify the straightness and broken chip signals according to the frequency ranges. The straightness frequency occurs at the lower frequency on the higher level of wavelet transform. The chip breaking frequency appears at the higher frequency on the lower level of wavelet transform according to the chip length. The results supported the use of the decomposed feed forces to estimate the straightness error during the cutting process."
"Influence of liquid viscosity on the taylor bubble shape under a laminar condition in the falling film region and a constant froude number  2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.– The purpose of this work is to computationally find how the liquid viscosity affects the shape of an air Taylor bubble, which rises up in a vertical pipe when the flow in the falling film region is laminar and the Froude number is approximately 0.35. Five liquid viscosities (0.015, 0.020, 0.025, 0.030 and 0.035 Pa s) were selected as sample cases for the investigation. The grid search method was employed to find the appropriate shape of a Taylor bubble for each selected liquid viscosity by considering the pressure distribution of the air inside the bubble. The computational result and the mathematical analysis show that the Taylor bubble shape will be slenderer if the liquid viscosity is higher."
"Variation of the great auricular nerve and prediction of the facial nerve trunk size Copyright  2018 The Authors.

The work cannot be changed in any way or used commercially without permission from the journal.Background: This study aimed to reveal the anatomical variation in the great auricular nerve (GAN) and the correlation between the size of the GAN and the facial nerve trunk (FNT), so as to aid surgeons to perform safe facelift surgery and parotidectomy. Methods: Sixteen human cadavers were studied on 16 left and 15 right facial sides. The GAN's branching patterns, location, and the mean width of the GAN and FNT were measured. Results: The average distance where the nerve emerged from under the sternocleidomastoid muscle was 87.61 ± 12.13 mm when measured perpendicular to the Frankfort horizontal plane. The branching pattern of the GAN could be classified into 5 types of which the most common was type 3 (30.77%), where the GAN divided into the anterior (superficial) and posterior branches, and then the deep branch originated from the posterior branch of the GAN. The mean width of the GAN and FNT from all the dissections was 3.26 ± 0.67 mm and 3.36 ± 0.71 mm, respectively. There was a significant correlation between the width of the nerves on both facial sides (right: r =0.740, P =0.002; left: r = 0.839, P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study revealed the anatomical variation and the width of the GAN, which can strongly predict the width of the FNT. This should be taken into consideration during facelift surgery and parotidectomy, especially in patients with a small GAN to prevent iatrogenic injury to the small FNT."
"Development of competitive lateral flow immunoassay coupled with silver enhancement for simple and sensitive salivary cortisol detection  2018, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors. All rights reserved.Cortisol is known as a stress biomarker. The measurement of cortisol levels is an early warning indicator for health conditions and diagnosis of stress-related diseases. Herein, a lateral flow immunoassay using a gold nanoparticle label with a silver enhancement system was developed for the simple, sensitive and rapid detection of cortisol. The developed assay was based on a competitive platform of which cortisol-BSA conjugate was immobilized at the test zone to compete with an analyte. The quantitative analysis was performed using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as signal labeling. Sequentially, the silver enhancement solution was applied in order to enhance the sensitivity of the assay with the results easily seen by the naked eye. Using this system, the limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 0.5 ng/mL with a 3.6 fold more sensitive detection than without the enhancement system (LOD = 1.8 ng/mL). The salivary cortisol analysis was in the range of 0.5-150 ng/mL (R2 = 0.9984), which is in the clinical acceptable range. For the semi-quantitative analysis, the intensity color of the results was analyzed using an image processing program. The proposed method was successfully applied to detect cortisol in saliva. In addition, the results from our method also complied with the ones of those obtained by using the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This developed assay offers great promise for a non-invasive screening test of salivary cortisol."
"Immunohistochemical study of the laminin α5 chain and its specific receptor, basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM), in both fetal and adult rat pituitary glands  2018 The Japan Society of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry.Laminin, a major basement membrane protein, comprises three subunit chains: α, β, and γ chains. Among these chains, only the laminin α chain is capable of signaling via laminin receptors. Although laminin isoforms containing the α5 chain were reported to be the first laminin produced during rat anterior pituitary gland development, the functions of these isoforms are unknown. We used immunohistochemical techniques to localize the laminin α5 chain and its specific receptor, basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM), in fetal and adult pituitary gland. Laminin α5 chain immunoreactivity was observed in the basement membrane of the primordial adenohypophysis at embryonic days 12.5 to 19.5. Double immunostaining showed that BCAM was present and co-localized with the laminin α5 chain in the tissue. Quantitative analysis showed that the laminin α5 chain and BCAM were expressed in the anterior pituitary gland during postnatal development and in adulthood (postnatal day 60). In the adult gland, co-localization of the laminin α5 chain and BCAM was observed, and BCAM was detected in both the folliculo-stellate cells and endothelial cells. These results suggest that laminin α5 chain signaling via BCAM occurs in both the fetal adenohypophysis and adult anterior pituitary gland."
"An integrated program with home blood-pressure monitoring and village health volunteers for treating poorly controlled hypertension at the primary care level in an urban community of Thailand  2018 Visanuyothin et al.Purpose: Hypertension (HT) is accountable for death in half of the patients suffering from heart disease and stroke. Many treatment strategies have been used, but little research exists on an integrated program with home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and village health volunteers (VHVs) in an urban area of Thailand. The present study aims to determine the effectiveness of the integrated program, HBPM, and VHVs in supporting the target population. Patients and methods: This quasi-experiment was conducted from July to November 2017. Patients with poorly controlled HT were randomly selected from each of the two primary care units in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. The participants were separated into an experiment (n=63) and control group (n=65). The experiment group participated in the integrated program, which was based on the 20-item Health Literate Care Model. A valid and reliable questionnaire was used to collect data from participant interviews. Blood-pressure monitoring was used to measure systolic home blood pressure and diastolic home blood pressure. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, Fisher’s exact test, the independent t-test, and the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test were used to compare the baseline data. Multiple logistic regression was used to compare the differences between the mean changes in the outcomes. Results: At the end of the 3-month follow-up appointment, significant statistical changes were found. Systolic home blood pressure, diastolic home blood pressure, and body mass index changed −4.61 (95% CI −8.32, −0.90) mmHg (P-value=0.015), −3.5 (95% CI −5.31, −1.72) mmHg (P-value <0.001), and −0.86 (95% CI −1.29, −042) (P-value <0.001) respectively. Participant scores in lifestyle and management knowledge, and self-management behaviors significantly increased by 0.76 (95% CI 0.15–1.38) point (P-value=0.016) and 0.15 (95% CI 0.06, 0.24) point (P-value=0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The integrated program, HBPM, and VHVs were effective in decreasing blood pressure and body mass index, and increasing knowledge and self-management behaviors among urban patients with poorly controlled HT."
"Associations between structures and resources of primary care at the district level and health outcomes: A case study of diabetes mellitus care in Thailand  2018 Komwong and Sriratanaban.Background: The structural factors of primary care potentially influence its performance and quality. This study investigated the association between structural factors, including available primary care resources and health outcomes, by using diabetes-related ambulatory care sensitive conditions hospitalizations under the Universal Coverage Scheme in Thailand. Methods: A 2-year panel study used secondary data compiled at the district level. Administrative claim data from 838 districts during the 2014–2015 fiscal years from the National Health Security Office were used to analyze overall diabetes mellitus (DM) hospitalizations and its three subgroups: hospitalizations for uncontrolled diabetes, short-term complications, and long-term complications. Primary care structural data were obtained from the Ministry of Public Health. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the influence of structural factors on the age-standardized DM hospitalization ratio. Results: A higher overall DM and uncontrolled diabetes hospitalization ratio was related to an increasing concentration of outpatient utilization (using the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index) (overall DM; beta [standard error, SE]=0.003 [0.001], 95% CI 0.000, 0.006) and decreasing physician density and bed supply (overall DM; beta [SE]=−1.350 [0.674], 95% CI –2.671, –0.028), beta [SE]=−0.023 [0.011], 95% CI −0.045, –0.001, respectively). Hospitalizations for short-term complications increased with a decrease in health care facility density, whereas hospitalizations for long-term complications increased as that density increased. Rurality was strongly associated with higher hospitalization ratios for all DM hospitalizations except short-term complications. Conclusions: This study identified structural factors associated with health outcomes, many of which can be changed through reorganization at the district level."
"Numerical modelling of railway embankments for high-speed train constructed on soft soil  2018, Taiwan Geotechnical Society.Recently, several mass rapid transit projects have been launched to improve the logistics of trade in Thailand. The railway construction projects linked from Bangkok will be a challenging task for civil engineers since they are located on soft ground conditions. Consequently, an understanding of geomaterial properties and subsoil conditions is important in the design phase. This paper presents a numerical study of railway embankment behaviour when constructed on soft soil. Simplified finite-element modelling was performed to predict stability and deformation characteristics of railway embankments under high-speed design requirements. The construction materials, including ballasts and subgrade soils were selected and tested to characterise their engineering properties. It was found that existing railway embankment conditions exhibit a large degree of movement under a high-speed train load. The study recommends improvements of subgrade conditions, using methods such as cement stabilisation to enhance stability and reduce settlement of the railway embankments."
"Anti-rice pathogenic microbial activity of Persicaria sp. extracts  2018 Thammasat University. All rights reserved.The dichloromethane and methanol extracts, and the essential oil of Persicaria sp. were subjected to in vitro anti-rice pathogenic microbial activity tests. The essential oil displayed the most potential antimicrobial activity. GC-MS analysis revealed thirteen main compounds as dodecanal (54%), decanal (15%), trans-caryophyllene (8%), cyclododecane (7%) and α-humulene (5%). Strong antimicrobial activities of the oil and dodecanal were found against Rhizoctonia solani (IC50 of 0.066 and 0.851 mg/mL) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (MIC/MBC of 0.78/12.50 and 0.78/25.00 mg/mL), and potent activities against Bipolaris oryzae (IC50 of 3.047 and 3.341 mg/mL) and X. oryzae pv. oryzae (MIC/MBC of 3.12/12.50 and 3.12/25.00 mg/mL). In terms of structure-activity relationship, 2-dodecanone and 2-dodecanol displayed significantly anti-fungal activity, while 1- and 2-dodecanols expressed potent antibacterial activity. The essential oil might be used for new microcides controlling rice pathogenic bacteria and fungi."
"Effects of pesticide exposure on reproductivity of male groundnut farmers in Kyauk Kan village, nyaung-U, Mandalay region, Myanmar  2018 Zaw Lwin et al.Introduction: Kyauk Kan village of Nyaung-U, Mandalay region, Myanmar is one of the most famous groundnut-growing zones and has been exposed to pesticides. Methods: This study design provided evaluation of within-person changes in the season across growing and nongrowing periods. A cross-sectional study was performed to identify health problems related to organophosphate pesticide (OP) exposure, to explore the protected use of this pesticide among 400 participants in the community by face-to-face interviews, and to determine the reproductive effects of OP exposure by using biomarkers of 100 male groundnut farmers aged 18–49 years. Results: The mean age of the participants was 37.5±9.45 years. Analysis revealed statistically significant differences in seminal parameters (P<0.05 for pH, viscosity, motility, morphology, and sperm count) and in a reproductive hormonal assay (P<0.05 in follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone) between the growing and nongrowing periods. Blood-cholinesterase levels of plasma cholinesterase in the growing period were significantly higher than those in the nongrowing period (P<0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that chronic exposure related to OP dose may reduce potential male reproductivity."
"Search for the flavor-changing neutral current interactions of the top quark and the higgs boson which decays into a pair of b quarks at √s = 13 TeV  2018, Springer Verlag. All rights reserved.A search for flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) in events with the top quark and the Higgs boson is presented. The Higgs boson decay to a pair of b quarks is considered. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of√35.9 fb−1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at s = 13 TeV. Two channels are considered: single top quark FCNC production in association with the Higgs boson (pp → tH), and top quark pair production with FCNC decay of the top quark (t → qH). Final states with one isolated lepton and at least three reconstructed jets, among which at least two are associated with b quarks, are studied. No significant deviation is observed from the predicted background. Observed (expected) upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the branching fractions of top quark decays, B(t → uH) < 0.47% (0.34%) and B(t → cH) < 0.47% (0.44%), assuming a single nonzero FCNC coupling."
"A method for the isolation and characterization of mycosporine-like amino acids from cyanobacteria  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This report provides a broadly applicable and cost-effective method for the purification of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from cyanobacteria. As MAAs are known to have multiple bioactivities for health and beauty, a universal isolation method of MAAs from biomass is attractive. In particular, the biomass of photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria is of interest as a natural source of useful compound production, because of their photoautotrophic property. The method presented here is applicable for the isolation of mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G), which is a rare MAA produced in a halotolerant cyanobacterium. This method also allowed for the isolation of two of the most common MAAs, shinorine (SHI) and porphyra-334 (P334). A three-step separation process using low pressure liquid chromatography yielded purified MAAs, which were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analyses. The purified MAAs exhibited free radical scavenging activity in the 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay. The experimental parameters obtained in this report may allow for a scale-up of the MAA purification process for future industrial applications."
"Dissemination of Resistance and Virulence Determinants in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus During Colonization and Disease: A Review  2018. Bitrus et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The successful in vivo horizontal transfer of mobile genetic elements carrying resistance and virulence determinants have contributed immensely to a global dissemination of virulent and multi-drug resistant pathogens. The pathogenesis of MRSA infection is enhanced via initial colonization of the skin through the component of the microbial surface antigen recognizing adhesive matrix molecules and by their ability to evade host immune response. Furthermore, it was also observed that the genetic diversity of pathogenic MRSA is due to its’ ability to rapidly acquire resistance and virulence determinants. A characteristic feature that made it one of the most important nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Similarly, the expression of virulence gene in MRSA has been observed to be regulated by the accessory gene regulator system (agr). These system is made up of a series of genes whose product build up quorum-sensing regulatory mechanisms that is growth dependent. At a certain growth stage, the agr systems triggers a pronounced changes in the expression of genes called the quorum sensing. The findings of this review affirmed the importance of horizontal gene transfer in the dissemination of resistance and virulence determinants and as well as the genetic diversity of MRSA."
"Implementing a geographical information system to assess endemic fluoride areas in Lamphun, Thailand  2018 Theerawasttanasiri et al.Introduction: Many studies have shown that fluoride can cross the placenta and that exposure to high fluoride during pregnancy may result in premature birth and/or a low birth weight. Lamphun is one of six provinces in Thailand where natural water fluoride (WF) concentrations >10.0 mg/L were found, and it was also found that >50% of households used water with high fluoride levels. Nevertheless, geographical information system (GIS) and maps of endemic fluoride areas are lacking. We aimed to measure the fluoride level of village water supplies to assess endemic fluoride areas and present GIS with maps in Google Maps. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 2016 to January 2017. Purpose sampling was used to identify villages of districts with WF >10.0 mg/L in the Mueang Lamphun, Pasang, and Ban Thi districts. Water samples were collected with the geolocation measured by Smart System Info. Fluoride was analyzed with an ion-selective electrode instrument using a total ionic strength adjustment buffer. WF >0.70 mg/L was used to identify unsafe drinking water and areas with high endemic fluoride levels. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the findings, and MS Excel was used to create the GIS database. Maps were created in Google Earth and presented in Google Maps. Results: We found that WF concentrations ranged between 0.10–13.60 mg/L. Forty-four percent (n=439) of samples were at unsafe levels (>0.70 mg/L), and. 54% (n=303) of villages and 46% (n=79,807) of households used the unsafe drinking water. Fifty percent (n=26) of subdistricts were classified as being endemic fluoride areas. Five subdistricts were endemic fluoride areas, and in those, there were two subdistricts in which every household used unsafe drinking water. Conclusion: These findings show the distribution of endemic fluoride areas and unsafe drinking water in Lamphun. This is useful for health policy authorities, local governments, and villagers and enables collaboration to resolve these issues. The GIS data are available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mi4Pvomf5xHZ1MQjK44pdp2xXFw&usp=sharing."
"Sustaining employees through co-worker and supervisor support: Evidence from Thailand  2018, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This study aims to examine the effects of perceived co-worker and supervisor support on employees’ intention to quit in the food and beverage industry in Thailand. Design/Methodology/Approach: A total of 322 entry-level employees were recruited from one of Thailand’s largest food and beverage company as respondents for our survey. Data were then analysed using the OLS regression. Research findings: Our results highlight that workplace social support as indicated by existing literature were predominantly conducted in Western countries and these were found to be inapplicable in the Thai context. Our study also highlights some inconsistent results between the different age group of workers. Theoretical contributions/Originality: Our study expands on previous literature by making empirical contributions from the perspective of Thailand. As a collectivistic and feminine society, Thailand carries results that are different from the West. Our study also makes contributions by providing evidence drawn from the different age group perspective. Practitioner/Policy implications: Companies in Asian countries should reconsider their strategies in retaining workers. Our results offer strategies that are guided by the outcome generated from an Asian context which is highly different from the Western context. Research limitation/Implications: Since this study only focused on employees from one company, the generalisability of our results may be restricted."

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 18.5%. The patients with metabolic syndrome had significantly higher fasting blood sugar level, triglyceride level, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass index but lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than those without metabolic syndrome. A significant difference of carbohydrate intake between groups was observed. These findings indicated that metabolic syndrome could be found in human immunodeficiency virus–infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy, and the management of this problem should be taken into consideration."
"Impact of POR and CYP3A5 polymorphisms on trough concentration to dose ratio of tacrolimus in the early post-operative period following kidney transplantation Copyright  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Background: Tacrolimus, a critical dose drug, is widely used in transplantation. Knowing the contribution of genetic factors, which significantly influence tacrolimus variability, is beneficial in the personalization of its starting dose. The significant impact of CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms on tacrolimus exposure has been reported. Conflicting results of the additional influence of POR*28 polymorphisms on tacrolimus pharmacokinetic interindividual variability have been observed among different populations. The objective of this study was to explore the interaction between POR*28 and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms and their main effects on tacrolimus trough concentration to dose ratios on day 7 after kidney transplantation. Methods: Two hundred sixteen adult kidney transplant recipients participated in this retrospective study. All participants received a twice daily tacrolimus regimen. Blood samples and data were collected on day 7 after transplantation. A 2-way analysis of covariance was performed. Tested covariates were age, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and prednisolone dose. Results: A 2 · 2 analysis of covariance revealed that the interaction between CYP3A5 polymorphisms (CYP3A5 expresser and CYP3A5 nonexpresser) and POR polymorphisms (POR*28 carrier and POR*28 noncarrier) was not significant (F(1, 209) = 2.473, P = 0.117, h 2 P = 0.012). The predicted main effect of CYP3A5 and POR polymorphisms was significant (F(1, 209) = 105.565, P, 0.001, h 2 P = 0.336 and F(1, 209) = 4.007, P = 0.047, h 2 P = 0.019, respectively). Hemoglobin, age, and steroid dose influenced log C 0 / dose of tacrolimus (F(1, 209) = 20.612, P, 0.001, h 2 P = 0.090; F(1, 209) = 14.360, P, 0.001, h 2 P = 0.064; and F(1, 209) = 5.512, P = 0.020, h 2 P = 0.026, respectively). Conclusions: After adjusting for the influences of hemoglobin, age, and prednisolone dose, significant impacts of the CYP3A5 and POR polymorphisms on tacrolimus exposure were found. The effect of POR*28 and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms during the very early period after kidney transplantation is independent of each other."
"All quiet on the thai-cambodian front: Drivers, dynamics, directions  SOAS University of London 2018.That Thai-Cambodian relations are stable and peaceful after Thailand’s most recent military coup in 2014 is counterintuitive and inconsistent with recent trends and dynamics. When governments loyal to Thaksin Shinawatra took power over the past decade, bilateral relations were cordial and constructive. Conversely, when anti-Thaksin governments were in office, Thai-Cambodian relations became unstable and adversarial. But this has not been the case after the military regime under General Prayut Chan-ocha seized power and overthrew the Thaksin-aligned government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The dominant strand of scholarly explanations attributes the volatile bilateral relationship to Thai historical forces interacting with domestic politics, underpinned by a ‘national humiliation’ discourse dating to French imperialism. But such an informed understanding is unable to pinpoint the timing and extent of the bilateral conflict when it flared up. Synthesising overlapping streams of literature and drawing on select interviews, this article sets out to demonstrate that the post-coup Thai government’s commitment and resolve to prevail at all costs ahead of the royal succession and the incumbent Cambodian government’s weakened political legitimacy at home have combined to situate and normalise bilateral relations on a new plateau."

All rights reserved.In a world where taking photos has become a daily behavior to most people, it is deemed that a photo sharing service has the strong potential to recommend desirable sightseeing places for the majority of travelers. There is much research on location recommendations and route suggestions for sightseeing based on check-in frequency to extract the popularity of a location, which is used to infer a user’s interest in a place. However, the popularity of a location is not sufficient for the location recommendation, and user’s preferences in a place cannot be extracted using only the check-in frequency. In this study, we propose a recommendation system for sightseeing places based on user’s photo-taking behavior, where a large amount of photo data can be classified into five genres: scenery, architecture, nature, activity, and food. These data are leveraged to recommend popular sightseeing places according to a user’s preference that is extracted from the user’s photo-taking behavior. In the experiment, we test the classification capability of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) in deep learning for five genres of photo data that we collected using smartphones. The proposed system could be realized by incorporating CNN as a photo classifier into our photo sharing service to recommend sightseeing places."
"Determination of methane flux in organic paddy field  2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.This research was to investigate the amount of methane emission in the organic paddy field (wet-season rice), direct-seeding method around Tung Kula Rong Hai, the Northeast of Thailand during planting and harvest season and to examine the influential variables such as the growth, types of soil, temperature, height of rice plant, density of rice plant and the water level in the paddy field. The study was conducted in the paddy field of Khao Dawk Mali 105 in 4 stations. The results of the study revealed that; in period 1, from the period of seeding to tillering, CH4 Flux is in the range of 0.193–1.383 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 or 0.728± 0.429 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 in average; in period 2, from tillering to ripening, CH4 Flux is 1.311–2.446 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 with the average of 1.938 ± 0.359 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1; In period 3, from ripening to harvesting, CH4 Flux of 0.873– 2.235 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 with the average of 1.575± 0.351 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 Regarding the result, the amount of methane flux has increased according to the age span and the growth of the rice. Besides, there were factors affecting the escalation of the gas release: the water level in the paddy field which means the emission will be decreased when the water is managed to drain prior to harvest stage, considering the factors of the height of rice plant in the paddy field, the smaller number and lower rice plant height is, the lesser methane is emitted. However, in term of the temperature, the higher temperature is, the more methane increases. Consequently, the study of methane flux from rice paddy as well as its factors contributes to the farmers’ ability to manage their paddy fields effectively. This will lead to low organic carbon farming and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agricultural sectors."
"An environmental-semantic computing system for coral-analysis in water-quality and multi-spectral image spaces with ""Multi-Dimensional World Map""  2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.Environmental-semantic space integration is a promising approach to realize deep analysis environmental phenomena and situations. The essential computation in environmental study is context-dependent-differential computation to analyze the changes of various situations (air, water, CO2, places of livings, sea level, coral area, etc.). It is important to realize global environmental computing methodology for analyzing difference and diversity of nature and livings in a context dependent way with a large amount of information resources in terms of global environments. In the design of environment-analysis systems, one of the most important issues is how to integrate several environmental aspects and analyze environmental data resources with semantic interpretations. In this paper, we present an environmental-semantic computing system. Our environmental-semantic computing system realizes integration and semantic-search among environmental-semantic spaces with water-quality and image databases. We have already presented a concept of ""Semantic Computing System"" for analyzing and interpreting environmental phenomena and changes occurring in the oceans and rivers in the world. We also introduce the concept of ""SPA (Sensing, Processing and Analytical Actuation Functions)"" for realizing a global environmental system, to apply it to Multi-dimensional World Map (5-Dimensional World Map) System. This concept is effective and advantageous to design environmental systems with Physical-Cyber integration to detect environmental phenomena as real data resources in a physical-space (real space), map them to cyber-space to make analytical and semantic computing, and actuate the analytically computed results to the real space with visualization for expressing environmental phenomena, causalities and influences. This paper presents integration and semantic-analysis methods for two environmental-semantic spaces with water-quality and image databases. We have implemented an actual space integration system for accessing environmental information resources with water-quality and image analysis. We clarify the feasibility and effectiveness of our method and system by showing several experimental results for environmental medical document databases."

"Changes in chemical composition, minerals, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities during germination of sunflower sprout  2018 Acta Horticulturae.Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seeds are one of the major sources of vegetable oil in the world. Raw sunflower seeds contain high amount of fat, vitamins and minerals. Recently, in Thailand, sunflower sprouts are gaining interest because they are served as new vegetables and widely consumed as salads or stir-fried vegetables. Although, sunflower sprouts have been shown more beneficial effects than seeds due to increased levels of vitamins and minerals during germination, information on changes in minerals, total phenolic compounds (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant activities during the germination process is little. This study was aimed to determine chemical composition, minerals, TPC, TFC and antioxidant activities of sunflower sprouts during 7-day germination. Sunflower seeds were germinated at room temperature (32°C) for 7 days. Minerals in germinated seeds were identified and quantified. The antioxidant activities were determined using DPPH radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2'- azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) cation radical-scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay while TPC and TFC were measured using a spectrophotometric method. Results showed that as seeding days proceeded, the content of minerals such as potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, iron and zinc were increasing. The highest amount of TPC and TFC were found at the 7th day of germination. It was also found that the antioxidant activities of germinated sunflower sprout showed the highest level on the 7th day of cultivation and a positive correlation between bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities of sunflower sprouts was observed. The results indicated that germination process can improve protein and fiber contents, minerals content and antioxidant values of sunflower sprouts. Therefore, sunflower sprout should be promoted to be included in a meal for proper diet to maintaining consumer health status."
"Estimating actual evapotranspiration from NDVI using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery  2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.Evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of evaporation and transpiration from the surface to the atmosphere. ET is a hydrologic cycle component and importance in agricultural water management such as schedules of irrigation water requirement, irrigation system design and watershed management. Evapotranspiration can be measured or estimated using several methods. The objectives of this study were simple methods and quick analyses for the estimating of crop coefficients (Kc) and daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. Subsequent comparison of ETa from both satellite images at Ban Nong Bua, Amphoe Ban Fang, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. The results showed that good correlation between NDVI and ETa from both satellite images (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.85 and 0.87, respectively). Both satellite images can be used or combined to detect temporal and spatial analysis. Sentinel-2 can provide more fine resolution of 10 m in VIS-NIR bands than Landsat 8 and is suitable for precision farming or site specific management, while Landsat 8 TIRS bands were advantages."
"Profitability consideration of corrugated paperboard production based on carbon footprint reduction and the improvement of overall equipment effectiveness  2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.Environment friendly production is an emerging trend in industrial production. Enhancing environmental protection and ensuring company’s profitability have gained great attention from any manufacturers. The use of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) to reflect efficiency of production has been widely applied in the manufacturing process. However, the full advantage of OEE as a measure to simultaneously facilitate reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and to sustain the existing profitability has not been utilized. This study aimed to investigate the use of OEE to improve the manufacturing process of corrugated paper production using two indicators including CO2 emission and profitability. The research showed a model of measuring OEE, CO2 emission and Profitability. The obtained results indicated that impact 1 and impact 2 could maintain the same profitability (9%) but OEE and CFP from impact 1 (37% and 26%, respectively) were higher than those from impact 2 (12% and 8%, respectively). The overall results revealed that when improving OEE, CO2 emission per product (1m2) could be significantly reduced while profitability could be increased in the production of corrugated paper."

This result showed that the smartphone app based on the TPB could significantly affect self-efficacy for online learners; it has the potential to be an effective tool for teaching an online course."
"Auto mechanic students' perceptions and readiness toward mobile learning in Thailand  2018, International Association of Online Engineering.Access to quality education is now a huge challenge in Thailand with ever-increasing inequality between rural and urban populations. Existing teaching and learning facilities are no longer adequate. Mobile learning has been suggested as a sustainable and appropriate delivery mechanism to reduce this rural/urban education gap. Students are supplied with their own mobile device at no cost to learners or their families. Opportunities offered through mobile learning to auto mechanic education in Thailand were explored. Data from 384 auto mechanic students were collected and descriptive and multiple regression analyses were performed based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. Results showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and personal innovativeness were positively related to behavioral intention to use mobile learning. Furthermore, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation and personal innovativeness were the most significant predictors of behavioral intention to use mobile learning. Auto mechanic students in Thailand had positive perceptions toward mobile learning and the effect of students' effort expectancy provided a better explanation for the adoption of mobile learning in auto mechanic education."
"Gender differences in health care utilization among older adults in barbados  2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.Purpose Barbados is at a very advanced stage of population aging. Health care services are designed to ensure universal access for all Barbadians but the contributing factors for older adults’ health care utilization are not well explored. This chapter examines gender differences in the correlates of seeking medical care among older adults in Barbados. Methodology/approach Logistic regression models were applied to data drawn from the 2000 Survey of Health, Well-Being and Aging of Older Adults in Latin America and the Caribbean (SABE), Bridgetown sample (n = 1,068). Findings Health needs, based on chronic conditions, were positively associated with seeking medical care for men and women. Different forms and directions of intergenerational support were associated with men and women seeking care. Among men, receiving financial support was positively associated with seeking care. Among women, providing financial support was associated with lower odds of seeking care while receiving instrumental support was associated with higher odds of seeking care. Research limitations/implications Medical care is only one form of health care use and there is no specification of the nature of care or consultation. The sample is cross-sectional and limited to older adults in urban areas. The relative importance of enabling factors and health needs, especially, may differ across time and space within Barbados. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature on health care utilization among older adults within developing countries and highlights the pertinence of family relations influencing gender differences in health care utilization."

"Application of bioplastics and thermal reduced graphene oxide in electrochromic devices  2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Electrochromism refers to a phenomenon where materials change their optical characteristics reversibly through the manipulation of potential biases. This research aimed to study potentiality in the selection of bioplastic type such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) coated by thermal reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) for use as an electrode of electrochromic device. TRGO is the conductive layer. It was synthesized by simple method from graphite using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under microwave irradiation. The formation mechanism of TRGO was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In this study, using pyrrole monomer to generate electrochromic polymer and assembly with electrode for applying as electrochromic device. The electrochromic property was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry. The results show that TRGO exhibits good conductive and electrochromic devices can change color from yellow to black when applying electric current +1.2 V to -1.2 V because of oxidation and reduction of electrochromic polymer."
"Etching behaviors of tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) materials by ion beam etching system  2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In data storage manufacturing, ion etching process is commonly chosen for the preparation of surface patterns, for example, under the read-write head of the hard disk drive (HDD) to form an air bearing surface (ABS). This read-write head consists of a multilayer thin film of different materials to form a tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) device. In this work, we applied the Monte Carlo-based simulation package to calculate the etching yield of major materials in the HDD head's structure. The plasma characteristic in the industrial-size ion beam etching (IBE) system has been studied by the special plasma diagnostic probes. Effects of input parameters in IBE system such as incident beam angle, ion beam current and gas flow in the system were considered. Plasma characteristic can be obtained from plasma I-V curve characterization. The sputtering yields of materials were found maximum when an incident angle is about 70° to the normal surface. The floating potential of plasma in the system with the ion/electron compensation from PBN is calculated."
"The state of practice of software cost estimation: Evidence from thai software firms  2018 Newswood Limited. All rights reserved.Software cost and effort estimation is crucial for software project management success. It is used for project planning and control of project resources. Parametric software cost estimation models have been introduced for decades since 1960 [1], [2]. Today, researchers are still introducing new software estimation models [3]. The practice of software cost estimation model is, therefore, one of the interest area for researchers [2], [4-9]. The objective of this study was to explore how the software estimation was actually practiced in Thai software firms. This paper presents the findings from the returned 26 the questionnaires from a survey of Thai software firms. The findings indicate the discrepancy between theory and practice. The companies studied have not applied software cost estimation models found in the literature. Expert judgment and analogy method are the most employed instead. The companies also indicate that they cannot find appropriate software cost estimation models or tools that are accurate, easy to learn and use."

"Rethinking Thai Secondary Education  2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.This chapter presents both the current situation and future perspectives on the Thai secondary education system. As the system has only been fully developed for just over half a century, it is still coping with shortcomings in many respects. As the system embraces quite a variety of schools, from top science schools and international schools in Bangkok and some major cities to small and under-subsidized schools in rural areas, it is quite challenging to transform our wide range of schools into a more equitable and relevant system. With the government’s ambitious plan to prepare Thailand to become an innovation-driven economy and a knowledge-based society, it is imperative that secondary education must respond to future needs of the country. The notion of a career-oriented curriculum for employability and entrepreneurship, the area approach for reform particularly in special economic zones, the new competencies required for teachers and administrators, and reinvesting in our secondary schools are some of the key issues discussed in the chapter."
"Shadow Education in Thailand: Thai and International Perspectives  2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.“Shadow education,” known as “for-profit” private supplementary tutoring or coaching, has operated all over the world, in both Western and non-Western countries, including many Asian countries such as Korea and Japan. In Thailand, this kind of “educational industry” has grown and spread rapidly since the early 1990s. While the mainstream or regular schooling aims to impart to students’ traditional knowledge and skills officially stated in the curriculum and courses set by an authorized party, private tutoring, which appears in various forms, provides students with additional information and coaching or training to prepare them well for a variety of examinations or to become well equipped with some specific skills, such as other languages, mathematics, performing arts, or sports. At present, many students or parents have interest in additional tutoring or invest more in this industry despite having been already burdened with heavy workloads from the system of formal schooling. Apart from sharing some intriguing data on the popularity of shadow education and its growth in Thailand, this chapter probes into the reasons behind such a phenomenon, its pros and cons, and also explores some policy strategies and guidelines to cope with private tutoring issues."
"Redesigning Teacher Education  2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.Teacher education in Thailand is one of the most critical issues in education reform. It has always been the responsibility of government to provide both preservice and in-service teacher education programs. Preservice teacher education programs can be either a 5-year bachelor’s degree in education, or a 1-year graduate diploma in teaching, or a master’s degree in teaching. However, Thailand is now facing a paradox with shortages of teachers at the school level in certain geographic areas and fields, while there is at the same time an oversupply of trained teachers. There are also a lack of fit between teacher preparation and class assignments and the lack of teachers in core areas causing the practice of out-of-field teaching in which teachers trained in one field of study are assigned by school to teacher class in another area of study. There is a need to redesign teacher education to prepare Thai teachers better for the complex challenges of the twenty-first century. A better fit between teacher supply and demand is the most urgent agenda. The retraining and reallocation of out-of-field teachers are the second urgent agenda. The redesign of teacher education programs (both preservice and in-service) is the third urgent agenda. To retain their leading role, Thai teacher education institutes must produce a “new breed of teacher.” These teachers must know their subject matter well and have a passion for teaching it. They must also understand deeply the nature of student-centered, constructivist learning and learning how to be innovator."
"Performance Of OLSR manet adopting cross-layer approach under CBR and VBR traffics environment  2018, International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications (IJCNC).The routing protocols play an important role in Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) because of the dynamically change of its topology. Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR), unawareness of Quality of Service (QoS) and power-consumed protocol, is an example of a widely-used routing protocol in MANET. The Multi-Point Relays (MPR) selection algorithm is very crucial in OLSR. Therefore, firstly, we propose a heuristic method to select the best path based on two parameters; Bit Error Rate (BER) derived from the physical layer and Weighted Connectivity Index (CI) adopted from the network layer. This can be done via the cross-layer design scheme. This is anticipated to enhance the performance of OLSR, provide QoS guarantee and improve the power consumption. The performances of the proposed scheme are investigated by simulation of two types of traffics: CBR and VBR (MPEG-4), evaluated by metrics namely Throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Average End-to-End Delay, Control Overhead and Average Total Power Consumption.We compare our results with the typical OLSR and OLSR using only Weighted CI. It is obvious that our proposed scheme provides superior performances to the typical OLSR and OLSR using only Weighted CI, especially, at high traffic load."
"The combined effect of calcium, pectin methylesterase and mild heat on frozen mango quality  2018 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.Both single and mixed solutions of calcium and pectin methylesterase were studied to examine how they improve the quality of frozen mango. The result showed that calcium and pectin methylesterase had a synergistic effect on the mango, helping to improve firmness and decrease the drip loss of the frozen fruit. To increase the efficiency of the mixed solution of pectin methylesterase and calcium, this study examined three immersion temperatures (25, 40 and 50 °C). Pectin methylesterase activity, calcium content, ß-carotene content, firmness, drip loss and color of the samples were evaluated. The treatment at 40 °C caused high pectin methylesterase activity and calcium content. The firmness of the frozen-thawed mango increased two-fold from 1.25 to 2.50 N, and the drip loss decreased from 15.19 to 9.87 g/100 g when compared with the control samples. Moreover, the frozen-thawed mango that was immersed in pectin methylesterase and calcium at 40 °C had the highest lightness and hue value and the lowest browning index."
"Immunophenotyping oral amyloidosis for the precise identification of the biochemical forms: A retrospective study  2018 Binmadi et al.Background: Amyloidosis refers to a group of systemic and localized disorders associated with the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates called amyloids in different parts of the body. Owing to the existence of multiple forms of amyloids with similar tertiary structures, precise identification of their biochemical form is critical for correct therapy. Objective: This retrospective study aimed to determine whether typing of oral amyloid deposits can help diagnose a serious systemic condition in the early phase of the disease Methods: All histopathologically confirmed cases of amyloidosis managed over a 14-year period (January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2011) were retrieved for analysis. Two board-certified oral and maxillofacial pathologists reviewed the histopathological findings of amyloidosis on the basis of its classic Congo red staining characteristics. This was followed by immunohistochemical analysis of biopsy samples using a panel of antibodies specific for different forms of amyloidosis. Results: The most common location of amyloidosis was the tongue, and women were more commonly affected than men. The patient age ranged from 11 to 83 years (average 59.3 years). In patient 9, light-chain and pre-albumin (transthyretin) antibodies were related to arthritis and senile amyloidosis, respectively. The biopsy sample of patient 10, who was reported to have multiple myeloma, was positive for light chains and β2 microglobulin. All other samples exhibited localized (solitary) amyloidosis. Conclusion: Histological analysis coupled with immunostaining with a panel of specific antibodies might assist in identifying early systemic amyloidosis in patients with localized oral forms of the disease."
"Pharmacokinetics and 48-week safety and efficacy of generic ritonavir tablet-boosted atazanavir in HIV-1-infected Thai adults 2018 International Medical Press. Background: Ritonavir (RTV) tablets were not available in Thailand until they were manufactured by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization of Thailand. We assessed pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy of generic RTV-boosted atazanavir (ATV) in virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected Thai adults. Methods: Virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected Thai adults who currently use ATV (either 200 or 300 mg) with Norvir soft gel capsule (SGC) 100-mg-based regimen were enrolled into this prospective, 48-week single-arm study. Participants switched from Norvir SGC to generic RTV. Plasma trough concentration (C trough ) was assessed at baseline before switching to generic RTV and week 24 in all participants, with the target ATV C trough of 0.15 mg/l. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and other laboratory safety parameters were assessed until week 48. Results: Of 100 participants (51% male) enrolled, 50% was using ATV 200 mg and 50% was using 300 mg at the time RTV SGC were changed into generic tablets. All participants used two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) as backbone. There were no significant changes in mean (SD) C trough of RTV (0.20 [0.33] versus 0.23 [0.39]; P=0.21) and ATV (0.83 [0.93] versus 0.88 [0.95]; P=0.62) between baseline and week 24. From entry to week 48, median alanine aminotransferase significantly increased from 25 to 30 IU/l (P=0.001) and total bilirubin significantly decreased from 1.7 to 1.3 (P=0.04). One study drug related grade 3 adverse event was reported. All but one participant maintained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml after 48 weeks. Conclusions: Generic RTV-boosted ATV showed adequate levels, good tolerability and great efficacy after 48 weeks."
"Gene polymorphisms of interferons and their receptors in chronic hepatitis B virus infection and hepatocellular carcinoma  2018, Research Trends. All rights reserved.Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). CHB can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Strong evidence for the effect of host genetics has been previously reported. Hence, the difference in host genetics might affect the various outcomes of HBV infection. Polymorphisms in genes encoding interferons (IFNs) and interferon receptors such as IFN-α, IFN-γ, IFN-λ, IFNAR1, IFNAR2, IL10R2/IL10RB, IFNGR1, and IFNGR2 have been reported to be responsible for susceptibility to CHB infection. In this review, the current information in the literature on the association between gene polymorphisms of IFNs and their receptors and chronic HBV infection is summarized. This information can be used to determine the risk for CHB infection and/or the development of liver cancer. In addition, the knowledge about genetic polymorphisms could be applied for prevention, treatment of HBV infections, and the development of new therapeutics for HBV patients."

All students have a moderate level of values. Success factors and barriers were discussed."
"A recombinant fab antibody against kwakhurin as a tool for sensitive indirect competitive ELISA  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Background: Pueraria candollei var. mirifica (P. candollei), known as White Kwao Krua in Thai, has long been used in traditional Thai medicine for the symptoms of menopause due to the potent estrogenic activity exhibited by the isoflavonoids and chromenes it contains. Recently, health hazards caused by P. candollei-derived products have arisen in Japan, and demands for analytical methods to standardize the P. candollei have been increasing. Previously, we have focused on quantifying the unique P. candollei-derived isoflavonoid kwakhurin (Kwa) and developed an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against Kwa. However, MAb preparation requires the use of costly culture medium and sophisticated techniques. Objective and Method: In this study, we produced a recombinant antigen-binding fragment (Fab) against Kwa, as an alternative to MAb, for use in icELISA for quantitative analysis of Kwa. The VH-CH1 and VL-CL proteins were individually expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain and were then refolded to form active anti-Kwa Fab. Results and Conclusion: Characterization of anti-Kwa Fab revealed that it possessed high specificity (cross-reactivities with other Kwa-related compounds, <0.03%) and high sensitivity (limit of detection, 8.16 ng/mL). Additionally, validation analyses indicated that icELISA using anti-Kwa Fab is highly precise, accurate, and sufficiently reliable for use in quantitative analysis of Kwa. Consequently, an icELISA incorporating anti-Kwa Fab was developed for the analysis of P. candollei-derived products, to assure consumer safety."
"The feasibility determination of risky severe complications of arterial vasculature regarding the filler injection sites at the tear trough Copyright  2018 by the American Society of Plastic SurgeonsBackground: The tear trough is a significant sign of periorbital aging and has usually been corrected with filler injection. However, the arterial supply surrounding the tear trough could be inadvertently injured during injection; therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the nearest arterial locations related to the tear trough and investigate the possibility of severe complications following filler injection. Methods: Thirty hemifaces of 15 Thai embalmed cadavers were used in this study. Results: The artery located closest to both the inferior margin (TT1) and mid-pupil level (TT2) of the tear trough was found to be the palpebral branch of the infraorbital artery. Furthermore, at 0.5 mm along the tear trough from the medial canthus (TT3), the angular artery was identified, which was found to be a branch of the ophthalmic artery. The artery at TT1 and TT2 was located beneath both the zygomaticus major and the orbicularis oculi muscles. The distances from TT1 to the artery were measured as follows: laterally, 2.79 ± 1.08 mm along the x axis; and inferiorly, 2.88 ± 1.57 mm along the y axis. For the TT2, the artery was located inferomedially from the landmark of 4.65 ± 1.83 mm along the x axis and 7.13 ± 3.99 mm along the y axis. However, the distance along the x axis at TT3 was located medially as 4.00 ± 2.37 mm. Conclusion: The high risk of injury to the artery at the tear trough should be considered because of the numerous arteries to this area."
"The lived experiences of becoming first-line nurse managers: A phenomenological study  2017 Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research.Background: Designated roles of first-line nurse managers (FLNMs) are very complex, this study aimed to develop a deeper understanding of their meaningful lived experiences. Materials and Methods: This study employed a phenomenological study using semi-structured interviews with FLNMs (n = 7) at the General Hospital of Belitung, Indonesia. The data analysis was thematic. Results: Four major themes were identified from the analysis of textual data: Feeling extraordinary, the inability to do, desire to leave the unit, and influenced by work motivation. The findings of this study revealed the positive and negative experiences of becoming FLNMs. The positive experiences were related to the feeling challenged and extraordinary to deal with many roles in management and leadership. The negative experiences included personal conflict related to the desire to leave the unit, and feeling unable to manage. However, the works of FLNMs were influenced by internal and external motivation. Conclusions: This study better informs nurse executives to develop competence and performance of FLNMs, and keep their motivation by revising performance appraisal system."
"Enhancing understandability of objective C programs using naming convention checking framework  2018 Newswood Limited.Understandability is a software characteristic that helps ease software maintenance and evolution. When modifying or reusing software that is written by someone else, software developers often have difficulties in trying to understand what the existing software does and how. Such an issue is commonly found in software-developing organizations. This paper discusses an approach taken by an IT organization in Thailand which attempts to enforce coding standards within its iOS development team in order to promote software understandability and maintainability. Among coding standards, naming conventions are important but are most often violated. This paper presents the development of a naming convention checking framework that consists of tools to automatically detect naming convention violations in Objective C programs. The framework facilitates iOS developers in modifying the programs so that they adhere to the naming conventions. An experiment showed that the developers’ understanding in the programs that had been modified, as suggested by the naming convention checking framework, did improve at a statistical significance level of 0.05. This approach can enhance program understandability and can be applied to other software-developing organizations."
"Access to medicines for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in Thailand  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Aim: Cancer drugs have become prohibitive, and consequently their accessibility has increasingly been of great concern in many countries. Particularly, the information about cancer drug access in Thailand has been sporadic. Therefore, the goal of the study was to examine the antineoplastic drug accessibility in Thailand in terms of both market access and patient access. In addition, this study evaluated antineoplastic drugs based on cancer incidence in Thailand, and especially those for the top 3 common cancer types: Breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. Method: The study method was descriptive in nature to evaluate the number of antineoplastic drugs in both Thai market and reimbursement list or National List of Essential Medicines to reflect the market access and patient access, respectively. In determining Thailand’s market access, the number of active ingredients (APIs) of antineoplastic drugs was obtained from the WHO website as a reference to the number of Thailand’s marketing authorization approvals (MAAs) of antineoplastic drugs as per the Thai FDA website. For the determination of patient access, the number of antineoplastic drugs available to Thai patients was extracted from 2016 NLEM so that it can be compared to Thailand’s MAAs. For further delineation with respect to treatments for each cancer type (ranked by cancer incidence in Thailand), the total number of APIs for each cancer type was used to determine market access and patient access. Results: The accessibility of antineoplastic drugs was 49% (88 of 180 APIs of WHO) for Thailand’s market access and 43% (38 of 88 APIs in Thailand) for the patient access. For the top 3 cancer types, the market access was of a high percentage while the patient access from NLEM list was of low percentage. Conclusions: The market accessibility of antineoplastic drugs did not pose a problem for Thailand. Registrations of anti-cancer drugs undoubtedly played a key role for the market accessibility. However, new innovative antineoplastic drugs have presented a rather considerable concern for Thai patients, which are further complicated by the NLEM selection process and the limitation of use according to the categories outlined in the NLEM requirements. Therefore, improvement is clearly needed for patient access to new innovative antineoplastic drugs."
"DNA barcoding for authentication of the endangered plants in genus Aquilaria  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Introduction: Agarwood is a type of wood that is used in traditional Thai medicines and has been applied in several recipes; in particular, this wood is considered as a costly resinous non-wood product. However, the morphological characteristics of the plant in the genus Aquilaria are quite similar, and so the authentication steps need a botanical expert for the purposes of identification and then also require an efficient tool for species-level discrimination. DNA barcoding is an approved molecular technique which uses a short sequence as a barcoding region specific for identified species. Materials and Methods: In this study, we established the DNA barcoding sequences from six candidate of barcoding loci (ITS, matK, rbcL, rpoC1, psbA-trnH intergenic spacer, and ycf1) from three species of Aquilaria, and the outgroup (Enkleia siamensis (Kurz) Nervling). The phylogenetic tree of each locus was reconstructed and the genetic distances were also determined using a maximum likelihood method. Results: Our results showed that all samples in each locus were successfully amplified and sequenced with universal primers. The ITS was only performed with suitable markers for Aquilaria species identification, which were considered from ML phylogenetic tree reconstruction and the optimum length of genetic distance. Other cpDNA barcoding regions; matK, rbcL, rpoC1, ycf1 and trnH-psbA, showed lower discrimination power, so these loci were deemed inappropriate for species identification. Notwithstanding, each barcoding locus can be suitable for genus discrimination in the Thymelaeaceae family. Conclusion: From our findings, DNA barcoding is able to be used as an efficient and reliable tool in Aquilaria species authentication, which can be applied for quality control in the agarwood in the global market."

"A corpus stylistic study of singular and plural keywords in Jane Austen’s persuasion  Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.While many corpus stylistic studies that draw on keywords pay attention to meanings of the lexical items, the present study focuses on their grammatical forms and argues that the forms largely account for the significance of keywords of a text and their contributions to meanings in a literary text. The nouns “years” and “man”, which were found to be statistically significant in Jane Austen’s Persuasion, were studied in terms of their co-occurrence patterns and textual functions. Concordance lines of these two words were analysed in comparison with their singular and plural non-key counterparts. The analysis reveals that the singular and plural forms of the keywords play an important role in the construction of thematic meanings and narrative techniques in the novel. It is suggested that an examination of grammatical aspects of keywords can provide contributions not only to literary studies of a novel but also to corpus stylistic methods and to theoretical linguistic arguments on word meanings."

"Episodic positive selection in the cam734 haplotype and low prevalence of the A144F mutation in plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene among thai isolates  2018, Malaysian Society for Parasitology. All rights reserved.Chloroquine resistance transporter of Plasmodium falciparum (PfCRT) is a food vacuolar transmembrane protein that mediates susceptibility of the parasite to chloroquine. A mutation at K76T of the Pfcrt gene is a key determinant for chloroquine resistance phenotype. In the absence of drug pressure, in vitro growth rate of chloroquine-resistance parasites was outcompeted by wild-type parasites unless intragenic compensatory mutations occurred. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum bearing the Cam734 haplotype known to circulate in endemic areas of Cambodia bordering Thailand contains 9 mutations in Pfcrt and exhibits both chloroquine resistance and comparable growth rate to the chloroquine-sensitive 3D7 strain. To analyze the evolution of the Cam734 haplotype, codon-based analysis was performed by using the mixed effects model of evolution (MEME), branch-site random effects likelihood (BR-REL) and other related methods. Results revealed that the Cam734 haplotype has evolved distinctively from other known mutant haplotypes including the most common Dd2 haplotype in Southeast Asia. Evidence of episodic positive selection was detected at codon 144, characterized by c.[430G>T; 431C>T] (p.A144F), known to be indispensable for both chloroquine resistance and restoration of growth rate of the parasites. To survey the prevalence of mutations at codons 76 and 144 in Pfcrt among Thai isolates, restriction fragment analysis of 548 P. falciparum isolates collected from six endemic provinces of Thailand during 1991 and 2016 was performed. The 144F Pfcrt mutant was detected in 7 (1.28%) isolates. All Thai isolates analyzed herein harbored a mutation at codon 76 whilst the wild-type parasite was not found. The low prevalence of isolates bearing the mutation 144F in PfCRT could imply little or lack of survival advantage of this mutant in endemic areas of Thailand where the wild-type parasites seem to be absent or extremely rare."
"An improved RSA procedure to compute shear force in tall RC shear wall buildings  2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.The Response Spectrum Analysis (RSA) procedure is widely used to compute the seismic design forces of a structure. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the RSA procedure underestimates the design shear force in the wall and have proposed the Higher Mode Elastic RSA (HME-RSA) method to compute the design shear force in the wall. For tall buildings, higher modes may not behave elastically. In this study, the accuracy of the HME-RSA method is evaluated and the Higher Mode Inelastic RSA (HMI-RSA) method is proposed to compute the design shear force in tall RC shear wall buildings. Four tall buildings with 15, 20, 31 and 39 stories subjected to earthquake excitations in Bangkok, Thailand, were first designed by the RSA procedure, then Nonlinear Response History Analysis (NLRHA) was conducted to compute more accurate results. It was found that the HME-RSA method overestimates shear force in the 31-and 39-story buildings. The HMI-RSA method could significantly improve the accuracy of the HME-RSA method in computing the design shear force in all four buildings that were considered."
"Rhodamine 6G and Au–Pd core–shell nanorods: Fluorescence enhancement for detection of mercury  2018, Institute of Physical Optics. All rights reserved.We show that hybrid organic–inorganic particles are efficient for accurate sensing of mercury ions and following up trace amounts of the mercury pollutions spread in the environment. The process of synthesis of a working substance starts from preparation of rhodamine 6G derivative. Then the dye molecules are bound on the surface of Au–Pd core–shell nanorods. Mercury ions with different concentrations are finally attached onto this fluorescence sensor. Fluorescence emission of the sensor is detected with a luminescence spectrophotometer. The experimental results demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity of one of our sensors, a sensor B, is remarkably enhanced when the mercury-ion concentration increases from 0 to 15.5 µM. The limit of detection of the ions is as low as 20.6 nM. The working mechanism of our fluorescence sensor can be explained through the fluorescence-energy transfer and the plasmonic effect associated with spirolactam forms of rhodamine and conducting bimetallic nanoparticles."
"Dual-band infrared video-based measurement using pulse wave maps to analyze heart rate variability  2018, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables us to capture the vital signs such as pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and even heart rate variability (HRV) without any contact devises. Although the papers of rPPG mainly focus on the use of standard RGB camera, it cannot used for the cases in night or under the dim light conditions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel noncontact method for monitoring HRV without visible lighting. The proposed method uses dual-band infrared videos to ensure robustness to fluctuations in illumination. The hemoglobin component is extracted via a simple projection from the dual-band pixel values in logarithmic space. We demonstrate the accurate extraction of pulse wave signals using pulse wave maps. As the results, we indicated the effectiveness of HRV monitoring in the situation under the dim light condition."
"Vertical capacity of large and deep barrette pile for Bangkok subsoils  Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.Recently, barrette piles have been used to replace conventional bored piles in order to increase allowable vertical pile capacity in the limited space projects such as high-rise building projects and elevated train projects. The basic of construction equipment, the slurry used during construction and construction time between barrette pile and bored pile construction are totally different. Therefore, their design parameters for pile capacity estimation should be different. In this research, pile load test was carried out on the fully-instrumented barrette piles. The test result can be separated into friction of each soil layer and end bearing. By considering stress-strain relationships, adhesion factor of clay layer, friction factor of sand layer and end bearing factor of sand layer can be calculated. These factors were found to be able to estimate ultimate pile capacity. Based on these factors, the estimated pile capacity was compared with another barrette pile tests. This estimation agreed well with the test results."
"Benfordness of chains of truncated beta distributions via a piecewise constant approximation  Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.A chain of truncated distributions is constructed from iter-atively truncating an initial distribution on the right. We show that if the initial distribution is a piecewise constant approximation of the Beta distribution with parameters α and 1 then the mantissas of the chain of truncated distributions converge to a mantissa-limit distribution distinct from the Benford’s law. For general approximating initial distributions, under some suitable conditions on these mantissas, we can conclude that the mantissa-limit distributions converge to the mantissa-limit distribution for the limiting initial distribution. As a result, we obtain an alternative proof of the fact that chains of truncated Beta distributions satisfy Benford’s law in the limit."
"Severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy requiring dialysis aggravated by prolonged fasting and intermittent high fat load in a ramadan fasting month in a patient with cptii homozygous mutation  2017, Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM).Background: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPTII) deficiency is a mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorder that can present antenatally as congenital brain malformations, or postnatally with lethal neonatal, severe infantile, or the most common adult myopathic forms. No case of severe hyperammonemia without liver dysfunction has been reported. Case Presentation: We described a 23-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with seizures and was found to have markedly elevation of serum ammonia. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated with successfully decreased ammonia to a safety level. He had a prolonged history of epilepsies and encephalopathic attacks that was associated with high ammonia level. Molecular diagnosis revealed a homozygous mutation in CPTII. The plasma acylcarnitine profile was consistent with the diagnosis. Failure to produce acetyl-CoA, the precursor of urea cycle from fatty acid in prolonged fasting state in Ramadan month, worsening mitochondrial functions from circulating long chain fatty acid and valproate toxicities were believed to contribute to this critical metabolic decompensation. Conclusion: Fatty acid oxidation disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hyperammonemia even without liver dysfunction. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CPTII deficiency presented with severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy required dialysis after prolonged religious related fasting."
"Knowledge acquisition toward startups' perspectives: Empirical cross-case study of leading technology business incubators in Thailand  2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.Startup progress is recognized as a vital driver to sustain economies. A technology business incubator (TBI) is one of the devices to serve it. Recent studies have found that one of the TBI's key success factors in assisting startups' survival is knowledge management (KM), particularly knowledge acquisition (KA). This study aims to examine startups' behaviors toward their KA that occurred between before and after accessing early-stage incubation (ESI) of TBIs. The study used a qualitative case survey research (Yin, 2013) for five selected cases of leading TBIs in Thailand, namely PSU, KKU, SUT, NSTDA, and STEP. Purposive sampling was used with data gathered from a total of 114 startups who were incubated from 2014 to 2016. Data were collected using primary data through a survey method with semi-structured questionnaires. A summative content analysis, validity, and reliability were used and tested. A conceptual model was created from reviewing recent studies and theories, including resource-based view, knowledge-based view, and KA theories to explore purposes. Findings show that startups' behaviors toward KA before accessing ESI need to acquire technical knowledge through online channels using ""search engines"" and ""target websites"" with more frequencies of KA. Startups' demand toward KA after accessing ESI is the need to acquire business rather than technical knowledge through both offline and online channels regarding methods related to different knowledge sources with more frequency. This shows both academic and practical contributions conducted at leading TBIs."
"Efficient decision trees for multi-class support vector machines using entropy and generalization error estimation  2019 Pittipol Kantavat, et al.. We propose new methods for support vector machines using a tree architecture for multi-class classification. In each node of the tree, we select an appropriate binary classifier, using entropy and generalization error estimation, then group the examples into positive and negative classes based on the selected classifier, and train a new classifier for use in the classification phase. The proposed methods can work in time complexity between O(log 2 N) and O(N), where N is the number of classes. We compare the performance of our methods with traditional techniques on the UCI machine learning repository using 10-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that the methods are very useful for problems that need fast classification time or those with a large number of classes, since the proposed methods run much faster than the traditional techniques but still provide comparable accuracy."
"An idea generation tool harnessing cultural heritage for design-driven entrepreneurs  2018 Allied Academies.The purpose of this paper is to propose an idea generation method for the concept development of cultural products by harnessing cultural heritage as source of inspiration.

"Natural antimicrobial lignin in polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone film for packaging application  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Lignin was extracted from sugarcane bagasse using alkali treatment process. The antimicrobial activity of sugarcane bagasse lignin (LNB) was evaluated against two pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by broth dilution method. The MIC and MBC values of LNB are 10,000 µg/ml and 20,000 µg/ml, respestively in both pathogenic bacteria. The composite film between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) blending with LNB at five different amounts (1%, 3%, 5%, 10% and 15%) were produced by solvent casting. The chemical interactions of composite films were investigated using FTIR. The IR spectra indicates the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of PVA or PVP and lignin. Furthermore, the overall migration was investigated. The migration results revealed that the PVA films blending with lignin up to 3% and the PVP films blending with lignin up to 5% could be considered suitable for application in fatty food packaging field."
"Efficacy and Validation of a Simulation-Based Compartment Syndrome Instructional Course Background: This study reports the validity and effectiveness of a simulation-based compartment syndrome instructional course. Methods: Six post-graduation year one (PGY1) orthopaedic residents and six PGY5 residents participated in the study. All PGY1 residents participated in a four-hour compartment syndrome training simulation. An anatomic compartment model was used to test needle placement accuracy in four leg muscle compartments. Pre-training, immediate post-training, and one-month post-training performance data were collected from all PGY1 residents, as well as data from a onetime assessment of all PGY5 residents. These assessments included a paper test for lower leg anatomy (anatomy module), a procedural test of needle placement accuracy using an anatomic compartment syndrome simulation module (needle placement module), and an assessment of ability to measure compartment pressure via low cost simulation (pressure measurement module). Face validity of the needle placement module and pressure measurement module were assessed using a structured questionnaire given to all 12 study participants and three orthopaedic faculty. Results: The PGY1 residents demonstrated significant improvement at immediate post-training in all three assessments compared to their pre-training performances (anatomy p=0.019, needle placement p=0.026, pressure measurement p=0.033 and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) score for pressure measurement p <0.0001). This performance was maintained at the one-month post-training assessment. Immediate post-training and one-month post-training PGY1 resident performances were comparable with PGY5 resident performance in all tests.Fifteen participants rated the face validity of the needle placement and pressure measurement modules. For the needle placement module, 73.3% of participants highly rated (4 out of 5 or greater) for realism, 86.7% highly rated for being an effective tool for teaching, and 80% highly rated for needing the model to be available throughout their training. The pressure measurement module did not receive high face validity ratings. Conclusions: With minimal, inexpensive training, the performance of junior residents in a compartment syndrome simulation was improved to a level comparable with senior residents. In addition, this performance was maintained at one-month post-training. The compartment syndrome anatomic module had highly-rated face validity. Clinical Relevance: Training junior residents to accurately diagnose compartment syndrome using a realistic simulation may allow for greater diagnostic accuracy in the clinical setting."
"The effects of concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles on dewetting suppression of PS thin films  2018 Chulalognkorn University.Thin polymer films are widely used in industry, such as protective coating, lubricant and electrical insulator, because of their specific properties. However, thin film in nanoscale tends to separate from substrate; this phenomenon is called Dewetting. In this research, a solution of polystyrenes with a concentration of 0.3 wt% in toluene, providing ~ 21 nm polymeric film, was prepared. Zinc-oxide nanoparticles were added in a polystyrene solution as a Dewetting inhibitor. The concentrations of zinc-oxide were varied from 0 - 1.0 wt%. Thin films were cast by a spin casting machine. After annealing at 90°C in a vacuum oven for various times, the film morphologies were studied by using optical, scanning electron, and atomic force microscopes. The surface energies of the films were calculated by contact angle measurement. We found that the addition of zinc-oxide nanoparticles at 0.3 wt% is an appropriate concentration to inhibit Dewetting in PS films which have a molecular weight of 35,000 g·mol-1."
"Effect of chromium content on the three-body-type abrasive wear behavior of multi-alloyed white cast iron  2018 Chulalognkorn University.The effect of Cr content on three-body-type abrasive wear behavior of multialloyed white cast iron was investigated. Multi-alloyed white cast irons were prepared with varying Cr content from 3-9 mass% under basic alloy composition. Annealed specimens were hardened from 1323 and 1373K austenitizing and tempered at three levels of temperatures which were at maximum hardness (HTmax), lower and higher than that at HTmax (L-HTmax and H-HTmax). A rubber wheel wear tester was used to evaluate the abrasive wear resistance. The hardness and volume fraction of the retained austenite (Vγ) varied depending on Cr content and heat treatment condition. The linear relation between wear loss and wear distance was obtained in all specimens. In each heat treatment condition, the wear rate (Rw) value decreased to 6 mass%Cr, and then, increased gradually as Cr content increased. Ashardened specimens showed higher wear resistance than tempered specimens did. In tempered state, the lowest Rw was obtained in HTmax specimen and the highest in LHTmax or H-HTmax specimens. The Rw lowered greatly as the macro-hardness rose to 830 HV30, and after that it decreased continuously as the hardness increased. Moreover, Rw scattered broadly at Vγ lower than 5%, and then, decreased gradually as Vγ rose."
"Consideration of key process parameters for achieving robust and uniform cutting of Ti-6Al-4V sheet metal using fiber laser with nitrogen assisted gas  2018 Chulalognkorn University.In laser cutting, to work on sensitive and intricate materials, such as titanium, requires rigorous control of parameters to achieve the best cutting results due to high power throughput and rapid cutting speed. Titanium is known for severe reaction with oxygen and nitrogen at elevated temperatures, however the more inert argon assist gas is cost prohibitive in commercial application. To achieve cut quality using nitrogen as an assist gas in titanium cutting, careful control is needed to prevent the formation of hard and brittle martensite as well as nitride- and oxide- phases. To better understand the roles of industrial grade raw materials and assist gas in commercial laser cutting, phase transformation, heat affected zone (HAZ) cut quality and the relationships amongst parameters have been selected to mimic industrial setups. 2mm thick titanium sheet was cut by a fiber laser cutting process using nitrogen assist gas by varying three cutting parameters including (i) laser power (1000-3000 watts), (ii) cutting speed (4000-26000 mm/min), and (iii) assist gas pressure (1-20 bars). Cut quality assessment was interpreted through the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical observation to link with mechanical properties from bending and v-notch fracture tests. The results showed that increase in cutting speed will limit the thickness of heat-affected zone (HAZ) which varied from 20-500 um. Pressure of the assist gas should be above a threshold value of 8 bar to assure complete ejection of the liquid melt pool. Key observations were reported along with root causes, such as, (i) non-uniformed and thick HAZ layer, (ii) thick and brittle recast (RC) layer, as well as (iii) micro-tearing due to localized expansion of nitrogen rich phase."
"A study of microcrystalline cellulose prepared from parawood (Hevea brasiliensis) sawdust waste using different acid types  2018 Chulalognkorn University.Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) from parawood sawdust (PWS) was successfully prepared by acid hydrolysis method. In this work, parawood sawdust waste was obtained from furniture factory. Initially, PWS was subjected to an alkali pulping and bleaching processes, respectively. After that, the microcrystalline cellulose was prepared from bleached pulp using hydrochloric and sulfuric acid in order to compare the effect of acid type. The parameters for acid hydrolysis process were investigated in terms of reaction time and pulp to acid ratio at constant temperature of 80°C. The properties of obtained MCC such as functional groups, degree of polymerization (DP), crystallinity index (CrI), thermal stability and morphology were evaluated. XRD analysis, indicated native cellulose type I structure of MCC, while SEM micrographs revealed rod-like shape morphology in its aggregates. It can be observed that at the same conditions using hydrochloric acid to prepare MCC provided higher degree of polymerization and thermal stability compared to sulfuric acid. Therefore, the optimum condition for preparing PWS-MCC was to carry out the reaction for 2 h with pulp to acid ratio 1:15 using hydrochloric acid solution at 80°C."
"Properties of UV-curable screen printing inks containing oligolactide acrylates  2018 Chulalognkorn University.This study was aimed at investigating the properties of UV-curable screen printing inks prepared from oligolactide acrylates. Those resultant inks were applied on substrates and cured by UV radiation. Then, properties of the cured ink films were evaluated and compared with a commercial acrylate ink. The degradation temperature of ink film was found at around 436°C. In addition, thus obtained films were glossy and transparent without yellowness. The weathering resistance of ink films tested by a Xenon test chamber for 500 h showed that ink films exhibited acceptable outdoor durability. Discoloration due to the degradation of lactide chain was observed, albeit color differences (ΔE) were satisfactorily less than 1. When compared to a commercial polyester acrylate ink, the prepared inks exhibited comparable properties. As a result, these prepared inks are commercially possible for substituting non biodegradable commercial inks particularly outdoor applications."
"Imaging improvement in angle-domain common-image-gathers by a local stack utilizing segmentation method  2018 SEG.Poynting vector based reverse time migration (PVRTM) can migrate seismic data into angle-domain common-image gathers (ADCIGs). The quality of common-image-gather is related to the used migration velocity. However, in the seismic data processing, we usually cannot obtain a very accurate depth migration velocity. The difference between the true depth velocity and estimated migration velocity would introduce image artifacts, which are often observed as non-flat events in the ADCIGs. These non-flat events will degrade the final image that is linearly stacked from all angles. To mitigate such image artifacts caused by the inaccurate migration velocity, we can use both quantitative and qualitative methods to optimize the stacking. The quantitative method uses a numerical method to achieve an optimal velocity model for migration. However, there is residual moveout error still left in the gathers. Instead, we propose a qualitative method to assure geologically meaningful result, so-called segmentation method using Moore neighborhood algorithm, which can decompose events in the ADCIGs into isolated signal groups. From this sequestered image domain, signals can manifest easier because of dealing only local signals that do not interfere with adjacent ones. We can automatically align concave events and focus stretching amplitudes at far angles. Additionally, we do not need cross-correlation to measure the moveout of non-flat events. Consequently, we can avoid the mismatching among the events at different depths. We test our proposed method by one numerical dataset. The numerical results show that the ADCIGs can correct the non-flat events in the ADCIGs from small angle to large angle. Compared with the tradition RTM with Laplace filtering and small angle stacking, our new method can produce a superior migration image with fewer artifacts. In practice, this proposed method can reduce the requirement of migration velocity accuracy in the depth velocity building and provide a first-look of RTM image."
"Review of the cardiovascular toxicity of amitriptyline treatment for canine neuropathic pain  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Nowadays, the lifespan of pets has been increased by improvements in veterinary practice but age-related disorders are also increasing. Several nervous system attenuations are well-known to be the result of aging and/or pathological lesions. In many cases, neuropathic pain (NP) can develop and cause a significant impact on the clinical outcome and quality of life. With the difficulty in identification of the specific cause of NP, most NP management is planned according to clinical manifestations and recommended trial therapy. The drug of choice for trial therapy seems to be amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant with multiple effects on neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. However, the pharmacological effects of amitriptyline depend on several pathophysiological factors, including the level of drug exposure, drug metabolism capacity, concurrent disease and cellular responsiveness. In addition to its therapeutic effects, amitriptyline also possesses several adverse effects, especially cardiovascular toxicity. However, the information on its toxicity in veterinary clinical practice is very limited. In this article, we review the use of amitriptyline in NP management and its cardiovascular attenuation using both human medicine and veterinary publications. The aim of this review is to highlight the importance of routine cardiovascular monitoring and to provide a list of parameters that are associated with amitriptyline cardiovascular toxicity."
"Comparison of isolation techniques for bone marrow derived canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the compatibility of MSCs loaded onto polycarpolactone hydroxyapatite  2018 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.Bone marrow was collected from 7 dogs and submitted to 3 different MSC isolation techniques (direct plating, red blood cell lysis and gradient density). The number of cells, expression of MSC markers and in vitro the osteogenic differentiation obtained from each technique were examined. In order to study in vivo the osteogenic capability of derived MSCs, non-union ulna lesions (n=3) were firstly induced by transplantation of a composite of polycarprolactone/ hydroxyapatite (PCL/HAp) scaffold experimentally on to a critical-size ulna bone defect. The MSCs were injected into the lesions. The non-union sites were examined by radiography, angiography and histology at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after MSC injection. Gradient density and RBC lysis techniques yielded higher numbers of putative MSCs on day 7 of culture compared with the direct plating technique. A large proportion of isolated MSCs, irrespective of the isolation techniques, expressed all MSC markers (CD 44 and CD 90). For all MSC transplanted dogs, neither radiological changes at scaffold-ulna interface nor callus formation was observed, although all donors used demonstrated in vitro osteogenesis. At 16 weeks after MSC injection, the angiogram indicated increased neovascularization. This was confirmed by the histological finding that there was an improvement of vascularization within the thick-fibrous tissue surrounding the scaffold. Gradient density and RBC lysis treatment are suitable MSC isolation techniques, in terms of the numbers of cells obtained and also their MSC properties. However, potential use of these MSCs following injection to a non-union bone site was compromised possibly because of a lack of osteogenic stimulation."
"Recognizing the leaky gut as a trans-diagnostic target for neuro-immune disorders using clinical chemistry and molecular immunology assays  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Background: Increased intestinal permeability with heightened translocation of Gram-negative bacteria, also known as “leaky gut”, is associated with the pathophysiology of neuroimmune disorders, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CSF) and (deficit) schizophrenia, as well as with general medical disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. This review aims to summarize clinical biochemistry and molecular immunology tests that may aid in the recognition of leaky gut in clinical practice. Methods: We searched online libraries, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar and Scopus, with the key words “diagnosis” or “biomarkers” and “leaky gut”, “bacterial translocation”, and “intestinal permeability” and focused on papers describing tests that may aid in the clinical recognition of leaky gut. Results: To evaluate tight junction barrier integrity, serum IgG/IgA/IgM responses to occludin and zonulin and IgA responses to actomyosin should be evaluated. The presence of cytotoxic bacterial products in serum can be evaluated using IgA/IgM responses to sonicated samples of common Gram-negative gut commensal bacteria and assays of serum lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and other bacterial toxins, including cytolethal distenting toxin, subunit B. Major factors associated with increased gut permeability, including gut dysbiosis and yeast overgrowth, use of NSAIDs and alcohol, food hypersensitivities (IgE-mediated), food intolerances (IgG-mediated), small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), systemic inflammation, psychosocial stressors, some infections (e.g., HIV) and dietary patterns, should be assessed. Stool samples can be used to assay gut dysbiosis, gut inflammation and decreased mucosal defenses using assays of fecal growth of bacteria, yeast and fungi and stool assays of calprotectin, secretory IgA, β-defensin, α-antitrypsin, lysozyme and lactoferrin. Blood and breath tests should be used to exclude common causes of increased gut permeability, namely, food hypersensitivities and intolerances, SIBO, lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption. Discussion: Here, we propose strategies to recognize “leaky gut” in a clinical setting using the most adequate clinical chemistry and molecular immunology assays."
"Common environmental factors may underpin the comorbidity between generalized anxiety disorder and mood disorders via activated nitro-oxidative pathways  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) commonly co-occurs with mood disorders, especially Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), which are accompanied by activated neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways. The aim of this narrative review is to review the phenomenological similarities and dissimilarities and the shared pathways between GAD and mood disorders. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for articles published in English from 1980 to present. GAD and mood disorders, either MDD or BD, show some phenomenological overlaps and a high degree of comorbidity, especially between GAD and MDD. Both GAD and mood disorders are also frequently comorbid with other anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and medical conditions, including car-dio-vascular disorder (CVD). Mood disorders have a worse prognosis when GAD is present. GAD and mood disorders are associated with female sex and may partly share genetic variants of risk. Moreover, both GAD and mood disorders frequently share similar environmental risks factors including Early Life Time Trauma (ELT) and Psychological Stressors in Adulthood (PSA). Increased nitro-oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation coupled to lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defenses are evident in GAD, MDD and type I bipolar patients. Patients with comorbid GAD and MDD show significantly higher nitro-oxidative biomarkers as compared with patients presenting with either GAD or MDD as well as patients with BD with or without co-occurring GAD. Activated immune-inflammatory processes characterized by increased levels of CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines are other shared pathways that underpin GAD and mood disorders. Moreover, these pathways may explain comorbidities with medical disorders including CVD. Aberrations in HPA-axis, GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, NMDA and mu opioid-receptors and neuroimaging fields have yielded more inconsistent findings. In conclusion, here we propose a new model explaining GAD and the comorbidity between GAD and mood disorders. Common triggers such as ELT/PSA may underpin GAD and its comorbidity with mood disorders via activated neuro-oxidative, neuro-nitrosative and neuro-immune pathways."
"Anxiety disorders: Sex differences in serotonin and tryptophan metabolism  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Introduction: Anxiety disorders manifest in women more than in men by almost twofold. This narrative review aims to summarize the sex-related biological factors, which underpin anxiety, focusing on the interactions of sex and tryptophan/serotonin with anxiety. Methods: A literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE databases from inception until December 31, 2017. Results: This review shows that sex may interact with many serotonin functions thereby modulating anxiety, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors, 5-HT transporter and central 5-HT concentrations and metabolism. Sex-steroids modulate the expression of serotonin transporter genes, creating a difference in serotonin availability. Sex and estrous cycle phases lead to varying anxiety responses to tryptophan depletion. Testosterone, progesterone and estrogen are important factors in mediating sex differences in serotonin responses to anxiety-generating behavioral tests. At prenatal levels, there are sex-related differences in the reciprocal relationships between serotonin and the HPA-axis, which modulate anxiety-like behaviors. Activated immune-inflammatory pathways induce indoleamine-2,3-dioxynease (IDO) and the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway thereby increasing tryptophan degradation and increasing the production of TRYCATs including kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which may create an overall anxiogenic effect. The effects of immune activation on IDO are significantly more pronounced in women than men, and therefore, females may show increased levels of anxiogenic TRYCAT following immune challenge. Aberrations in the IDO-activated TRYCAT pathway are found in pregnant females and parturients and are associated with increased anxiety levels in the postnatal period. Conclusion: The results of this review underscore the necessity of studying the associations between serotonin and anxiety in both sexes taking into account the effects of immune activation on IDO and production of anxiogenic TRYCATs. Future anxiety research should focus on the interactions between serotonin/tryptophan and sex, sex hormones, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the HPA axis and the immune system through the production of anxiogenic TRYCATs."
"Model for allocation of medical specialists in a hospital network  2018 Suppapitnarm and Pongpirul.Introduction: As human diseases are becoming increasingly complex, the need for medical specialist consultation is more pronounced, and innovative ways to allocate medical specialists in hospital networks are essential. This study aimed to construct allocation models using a multi-objective programming approach in a large private hospital network in Thailand. Methods: Our study included 13 medical specialist types in four main disease groups of the Bangkok Dusit Medical Services network. Mixed-integer linear programming models were developed using inputs from a modified Delphi survey of executives, the Physician Engagement Survey, and the Physician Registry (PR) databases and featuring three objectives: 1) minimizing travel expense, 2) optimizing physician engagement, and 3) maximizing the chance of direct patient encounters with respective medical specialists who were formally qualified for the clinical complexity of the patients, as measured by the case mix index (CMI). Results: The constructed models included the core components but varied by a combination of whether part-time medical specialists are included or not (noPT) and whether CMI is included (CMI) or not (noCMI). Because the noPT + CMI model had the highest capability to solve for specialist allocation, it was further improved for some specialist types in terms of flexibility for sensitivity analysis of the variables. Moreover, to assess the feasibility and practicality of the models, a web-based system incorporating the final model was developed to support the central executives’ decision to allocate medical specialists to the network, especially for finding the most optimal and timely solution for widespread shortages. Conclusion: The linear programming models that accommodate critical components for allocating medical specialists in the hospital network were feasible and practical for the central executives’ timely decision making. The models could be further tested for their application in hospitals in the public sector or other private hospital networks."
"Effects of a group activity-based motivational enhancement therapy program on social media addictive behaviors among junior high school students in Thailand: A cluster randomized trial  2018 Manwong et al.Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effects of a group activity-based motivational enhancement therapy (GA-MET) program on social media addictive behaviors among junior high school students. Materials and methods: This cluster randomized trial was performed in 245 junior high school students who used social media in the lower part of northeast Thailand. The GA-MET program group and the control group sessions lasted 8 weeks and were followed up 4 weeks later. The addictive social media behaviors, average duration of social media usage during weekdays and weekends (hours/day), child behaviors, self-esteem, and depression were investigated using a self-reported questionnaire. Multivariable linear regression was used to compare the mean and 95% CIs between two groups. Results: The GA-MET program significantly decreased the average duration of social media usage during weekdays and weekends (hours/day) (–1.27, 95% CI: −2.18,–0.37 and –1.25, 95% CI: −2.22, –0.29, respectively), emotional behavior (–0.69, 95% CI: −1.18, –0.19), and depression (–4.03, 95% CI: −6.07, –1.99) in the treated group compared to the control group. Conclusion: The GA-MET program could reduce the risk of social media addictive behaviors in junior high school students in Thailand by decreasing time spent on social media, emotional behaviors, and depression."
"Human asparagine synthetase associates with the mitotic spindle  2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Cancer cells are characterized by extensive reprogramming of metabolic pathways in order to promote cell division and survival. However, the growth promotion effects of metabolic reprogramming can be due to moonlighting functions of metabolic enzymes as well as the redirection of flux through particular pathways. To identify metabolic enzymes that might have potential moonlighting functions in oncogenesis, we have examined recent screens of the yeast GFP strain collection for metabolic enzymes that have been implicated in cancer metabolism with an unusual subcellular localization. Asparagine synthetase forms filaments in yeast in response to nutrient limitation and is part of a pathway that is a chemotherapy target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Interestingly, while yeast asparagine synthetase forms cytoplasmic filaments in response to nutrient stress, human asparagine synthetase is associated with the centrosomes and mitotic spindles. This localization is disrupted by both nocodazole and asparaginase treatments. This failure to localize occurs even though asparagine synthetase is highly upregulated in response to asparaginase treatment. Together, these results argue that human asparagine synthetase undergoes regulated recruitment to the mitotic spindles and that it may have acquired a second role in mitosis similar to other metabolic enzymes that contribute to metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells."
"Zoledronic acid is superior to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-switching for low bone mineral density in adults with HIV  2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.Objective: To compare the effects of switching tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or treatment with an intravenous bisphosphonate on bone mineral density (BMD) in HIVpositive adults with low bone mass. Design: Two-year, randomized, open-label study at 10 sites in Australia and Spain. Participants: Of 112 adults on TDF-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) screened, 87 with lowBMD (T-score1.0 at hip or spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and undetectable plasma HIV viral load were randomized to either switch TDF to another active antiretroviral drug or to continue TDF-based ART and receive intravenous zoledronic acid (ZOL) 5mg annually for 2 years. Primary outcome measure: Change in lumbar spine BMD at 24 months by intentionto-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included changes in femoral neck and total hip BMD, fractures, safety, and virological failure. Results: Forty-four participants were randomized to TDF switch and 43 to ZOL, mean age 50 years (SD 11), 96% men, mean TDF duration 5.9 years (SD 3.1), and mean spine and hip T-scores 1.6 and 1.3, respectively. At 24 months, mean spine BMD increased by 7.4% (SD 4.3%) with ZOL vs. 2.9% (SD 4.5%) with TDF-switch (mean difference 4.4%, 95% CI 2.6 6.3; P 0.001). Mean total hip BMD increased by 4.6 (SD 2.6%) and 2.6% (SD 4%), respectively (mean difference 1.9%, 95% CI 0.5 3.4; P 0.009). There was one fracture in the ZOL group vs. seven fractures in four TDF-switch participants. Virological failure occurred in one TDF-switch participant. Other safety endpoints were similar. Conclusion: ZOL is more effective than switching TDF at increasing BMD in HIVpositive adults with low bone mass."
"Paper-based chemical reaction arrays as an effective tool for geographical indication of turmerics  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Geographical indications have gained increasing importance as a powerful marketing tool for highly valuable products especially foods. In this study, a unique and synergistic combination of chemical reaction arrays on paper and chemometric analysis was used to uncover geographical indication of turmerics, an important food ingredient in several cultures. The key to effective differentiation was based on the subtle differences in the compositions of compounds found in each sample, mainly curcumin and derivatives. When these compounds reacted with various reagents in the form of paper arrays, different optical and fluorescence profiles were generated, which can then be exploited by chemometrics. As a result, our strategy could provide up to 94% prediction accuracy without the need for any sophisticated instruments."
"Human MicroRNAs Expression Profiles in Influenza B Virus-Infected Cells based on Illumina MiSeq Platform Copyright Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.BACKGROUND: Influenza B virus causes influenza-like illness in humans. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression through mRNA degradation or translational repression. MiRNAs have evolved to regulate many cellular processes including the viral infection response. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the miRNA profiles of human cells infected with influenza B virus. METHODS: A549 cells were infected with influenza B viruses (MOI = 0.5). MiRNAs were extracted at 24 and 48 hours post-infection. MiRNAs were used to construct four DNA libraries: influenza Binfected and an uninfected control for both time points. Then high-throughput sequencing was performed using the Miseq platform (Illumina). Sequencing data were analyzed by Miseq reporter software. The miRNAs were categorized and counted based on the frequency of reads. All filtered contigs were aligned with data from miRbase. The relative expression of each miRNA between uninfected and influenza B-infected cells was calculated. RESULTS: There were 13 down-regulated miRNAs and 21 up-regulated miRNAs observed in influenza B infected cells at 24 hours post infection. At 48 hours post infection, 14 miRNAs were downregulated, whereas 8 miRNAs were up-regulated. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that miRNAs may play important roles in host gene regulation in response to viral infection."
"Direct oral anticoagulants and travel-related venous thromboembolism  2018 Supat Chamnanchanunt, Ponlapat Rojnuckarin.Travel-related thromboembolism reflects the relationship between venous thromboembolism (VTE) and long-haul flights. Although this condition is rare, it may cause significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, travelers should be evaluated for the risks for thrombosis. Travel physicians should employ a clinical risk score and select in vestigations, prophylaxis, and treatment that are appropriate for each individual. This review summarizes current VTE clinical risk scores and patient management from various reliable guidelines. We summarized 16 reliable publications for reviewing data. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are currently the standard treatment for VTE and a prophylactic measure for VTE in orthopedic surgery. Compared with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), DOACs show better safety and similar efficacy without the need for monitoring, and have fewer food/drug interactions. Inferred from the data on general VTE, DOACs may be used to treat travel-related VTE. Although the data are lacking, DOACs may be used off-label as VTE prophylax is. Before using DOACs, physicians must know the pharmacology of the drugs well and should realize that the availability of antidotes for bleeding complications is limited."

All rights reserved.Recurrent hemorrhagic cyst is an uncommon presentation of breast disease. The ordinary imaging could not demonstrate the malignant features of the cyst. However, the non-contrast dedicated breast computerized tomography could support the malignancy concern. Although tissue diagnosis cannot show the malignant cell, Surgical excision could be offered without uncompromising. Eventually, ductal carcinoma in-situ was diagnosed and further adjuvant treatment could be given. We reported the first case report of ductal carcinoma in-situ, hypersecretory type, presented by a hemorrhagic cyst."
"Testicular structure and spermatogenesis of short mackerel, Rastrelliger brachysoma (Bleeker, 1851) in upper Gulf of Thailand  2018, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.Testicular structure and spermatogenesis of short mackerel, Rastrelliger brachysoma (Bleeker, 1851) (Teleostei: Scombridae) was first investigated. The testicular parenchyma was a lobular organ, which was classified as an unrestricted spermatogonial type. The classification of spermatogenetic stage could be classified into six stages based on the pattern of chromatin condensation and other characterizations at the light microscopic level. These six stages included the primary and secondary spermatogonium, primary and secondary spermatocyte, spermatid and spermatozoon. The spermatogenesis could also be classified into another four stages based on the nuclear and cytoplasmic characterizations at the ultrastructural level. Spermatogonium was the early germ cell. It underwent a series of mitotic division to reach the primary spermatocyte. Secondary spermatocyte was shown as the heterochromatin surrounding the nuclear membrane, which was rarely seen within seminiferous lobules. Stages during the spermatids differentiation comprised of the early, intermediate and late stages which are under the degree/change of chromatin condensation. Finally, the spermatozoon was revealed as the aquasperm primitive type. It was composed of an oval head without an acrosome, a short mid-piece consisting of two basal bodies (proximal and distal centrioles) and a long flagella tail without lateral fins. The axonemes of classical form with 9+2 microtubules were presented in the flagellum."
"Perspectives and experiences of thai adults using wheelchairs regarding barriers of access to dental services: A mixed methods study  2018 Sermsuti-anuwat and Pongpanich.Purpose: To explore the perspectives and experiences of Thai wheelchair users regarding barriers of access to dental services and report potential solutions in terms of customer satisfaction. Participants and methods: We conducted a 2-phase cross-sectional study with quantitative and qualitative components at a community club for individuals with disabilities in Pathum Thani province, Thailand, in February 2018. In quantitative phase, participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that consisted of 1) questions on demographic characteristics and 2) adapted questions that were based on the modified Penchansky and Thomas dimensions of access. Enter method of binary logistic regression analysis was used. Regarding qualitative phase, focus group discussions were conducted using the themes of a semi-structured discussion guide. Thematic analysis was used. Results: A total of 156 wheelchair users participated in the quantitative phase. Most study participants had not attended dental care services in the previous year (78.2%). Multivariate analysis found a statistically significant association that indicated that participants who had education level ≤primary education were 3.5 times more likely to had not attended a dental appointment in the previous year (P=0.003). In the qualitative phase, 33 participants were included in 3 focus groups (each comprising 11 participants), they were wheelchair users with education >primary, who did not go to see a dentist in the previous 12 months. Findings of the 3 focus groups suggest generally negative views about Thai dental services for all dimensions of access. Conclusion: This study reflects the unheard voices of wheelchair users and provides rigorous evidence in Thai context that difficulties of access to dental services persist. Policy makers and oral health professionals in oral health system should be alerted to the explicit barriers reported, such that equitable and equal dental services for disabled individuals can be developed."

The Promela source code, c-like source code, is analyzed and decomposed into a set of code chunks using the program slicing technique. Each code chunk of Promela will be verified to satisfy each simple logical condition term separately found in the linear temporal logic properties of data invariants. The separate checks are performed and eventually consolidated into the final result. It obviously shows that the state space of each separated model checking task has been reduced and more tractable. The SPIN model checker tool is used to evaluate our final results."
"DNA barcoding of species of Bacopa coupled with high-resolution melting analysis  2018 Published by NRC Research Press.In Thailand, there are three species of Bacopa, namely, B. monnieri, B. caroliniana, and B. floribunda. Among these species of Bacopa, B. monnieri is the only medicinal species, used for the treatment of cognitive impairment and improvement of cognitive abilities because of its bioactive constituents, bacoside A and B. However, because of the similar characteristics of these species, it is difficult to differentiate among related species, resulting in confusion during identification. For this reason, and to ensure therapeutic quality for consumers, authentication is important. In this study, the three abovementioned species of Bacopa were evaluated using barcoding coupled with high-resolution melting (Bar-HRM) analysis based on primers designed for the trnL-F sequences of the three species. The melting profiles of the trnL-F amplicons of B. caroliniana and B. floribunda were clearly different from the melting profile of the trnL-F amplicon from B. monnieri; thus, the species could be discriminated by Bar-HRM analysis. Bar-HRM was then used to authenticate commercial products in various forms. The melting curves of the six commercial samples indicated that all the tested products contained genuine B. monnieri species. This method provides an efficient and reliable authentication system for future commercial herbal products and offers a reference system for quality control."
"Clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma in Thailand  2018 Korean Society of Hematology.Background: Primary ocular adnexal extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (POML) is the most common subtype of lymphoma involving the eyes in Thailand. We sought to assess the characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with POML in Thailand. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patient data and included patients diagnosed with POML between January 2004 and December 2016 at Chiang Mai University Hospital and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand. We collected and analyzed patients' clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes. Results: Among 146 patients with lymphoma involving the eyes, 121 (82%) were diagnosed with POML. Sixty-four (52.9%) were women with median age 58 (range, 22-86) years. The most common presenting symptom was orbital mass (71.1%). Common sites of origin were the orbit (46.3%) and lacrimal gland (34.7%). At presentation, 22.3% of patients had bilateral eye involvement. About half of patients had stage I disease (N=59, 56.2%) and 20% had stage I V. Most patients (73.3%) had a low-risk International Prognostic Index. Radiotherapy was the main treatment for patients with limited-stage disease (66.7% in stage I and 56.5% in stage II). The overall response rate was 100% with complete response rates 80%, 77.3%, and 64.7% for stages I, II, and I V, respectively. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 66.1% and 94.0%, respectively. For patients with limited-stage disease, radiotherapy significantly improved PFS compared with treatment not involving radiotherapy (5-year PFS 89.9% vs. 37.3%, P=0.01). Conclusion: We revealed that POML has good response to treatment, especially radiotherapy, with excellent long-term outcome."
"Effect of heating rate on surface modification of Incoloy 825 by high activity pack aluminizing  2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Incoloy 825 is nickel-iron-chromium superalloy which selected as the materials using for petrochemical reactors. Because coke formation and carburizing cause a high temperature degradation of the alloy, the protective layers, i.e. Al2O3 and Cr2O3, are suggested to overcome such issues and prolong lifetime of the reactor. For a pack cementation, the heating rate is a process parameter in which influences on microstructure and performance of the aluminium-diffused layer. In this study, the heating rates are 5°C·min-1 and 30°C·min-1 in the high activity pack-aluminizing process at 700 to 900°C. Microstructure of the aluminized alloy consists of thin porous oxide film and homogeneous nickel-aluminide intermetallic layer. As the heating rate increases, the packing aluminium powder was found to be consumed with a shorter period of aluminizing time. This may result in the formation of porous oxide on the outermost layer which is consistent to the x-ray diffractions."
"Dielectric improvement from novel polymeric hybrid films derived by polylactic acid/nanosilver coated microcrystalline cellulose  2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In this work, the hybrid films were fabricated by utilized the polylactic acid (PLA) as a matrix embedded by microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) extracted from bagasse by 10% (w/v) sodium hydroxide (NaOH). To enhance the dielectric property of the hybrid films, the polarity of MCC was then modified by surface coating with 1% by mole of silver. The physical and chemical properties of MCC and nanosilver coated microcrystalline cellulose (Ag-MCC) were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and TGA. PLA with various ratios of MCC or Ag-MCC (1-5phr) were prepared as hybrid films by solution casting method. The dielectric properties of PLA, PLA/MCC and PLA/Ag-MCC hybrid films were measured at different frequencies ranging from 1kHz - 1MHz. The results exhibited that the PLA hybrid film with 3 phr of Ag-MCC offers the promising dielectric permittivity at 30 and the loss tangent about 0.08."
"Production of open-cell Al composite foams by direct casting with silica-gel beads  2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Open-cell Al composite foams, with the addition of Al2O3 particles, have been successfully produced, using direct casting technique of space holder materials. The amorphous silica-gel (SiO2) beads of 3 mm were employed as a space holder. The ADC12 cast Al alloy was added with 1-5 wt.% Al2O3 particles, prior to casting process. The infiltration of molten Al composites was performed at 750°C for 30 min with a pressure assistance. Elimination of silica-gel beads was achieved, using the solution of hydrofluoric (HF) acid for 10 h, resulting in open-cell foams with a porous structure, replicated to the morphology of silica-gel beads. However, it was found that the foam structure was also slightly damaged during the removal process of silica-gel beads.

"Effect of solution treatment and precipitation aging conditions on microstructural refurbishment in cast nickel base superalloy, grade MGA 1400  2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.The aim of this project is to study and evaluate the effect of reheat treatment conditions on microstructural refurbishment in cast nickel base superalloy, MGA 1400. This cast nickel base superalloy is used as a turbine blade material in Japanese gas turbine engines. The evaluated reheat treatment process consists of a solution treatment at 1125°C, 1150°C and 1175°C for 4 hours and followed by 1) final precipitation aging at 845°C for 25 hours or 2) primary aging at 925°C for 2 hours and secondary aging at 845°C for 25 hours. All reheat treated microstructures were investigated and analyzed by SEM and image analysis program. From all obtained results, it was found that at temperature of 1125°C for 4 hours followed by single precipitation aging at 845°C for 25 hours (without 2-steps aging) provides the best microstructural characteristics, which consists of the most uniform distribution of very dense gamma prime particles precipitating with its proper size and shape in the gamma matrix."
"Probing the promotional roles of cerium in the structure and performance of Cu/SiO2 catalysts for ethanol production  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this contribution, the efficient hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) to ethanol was achieved over a series of cerium promoted Cu/SiO2 (xCe-Cu/SiO2) catalysts prepared by a urea-assisted gelation approach. As a promoter, Ce played a crucial role in improving the structure, properties and catalytic performance of the Cu/SiO2 catalysts. The structure and chemical properties of the synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, in situ XRD, TEM, STEM-EDX mapping, N2O titration, H2-TPR, H2-TPD, XPS, XAES, etc. The characterization results disclosed that the addition of a Ce promoter to the Cu/SiO2 catalysts remarkably increased the Cu dispersion and retarded the sintering of small-sized Cu species. The strong interaction between the Ce promoter and Cu species substantially changed the redox properties of xCe-Cu/SiO2 catalysts and made the Cu2+ species easy to reduce. In addition, the activation ability of H2 species was significantly improved in the xCe-Cu/SiO2 catalysts, as evidenced by H2-TPD studies. Among these synthesized catalysts, the 1Ce-Cu/SiO2 catalyst with a 1.0 wt% Ce loading exhibited the highest catalytic activity (100% DMO conversion), ethanol selectivity (91.8%) and stability. This enhancement of catalytic activity, ethanol selectivity and stability is very promising for the development of an alternative route for the production of ethanol by hydrogenation of DMO from syngas."
"Loss to follow-up and associated factors of patients in the National AIDS Program in Thailand 2018 International Medical PressBackground: Loss to follow-up (LTFU) is a crucial indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of HIV care and treatment programmes. We assessed the LTFU rate and associated factors of Thai HIV-infected patients who enrolled in the National AIDS Program (NAP) for two periods: prior to (pre-ART) and after starting ART (ART-patients). Methods: Thai HIV patients aged ≥15 years enrolled in NAP from 2008 to 2014. Vital status was ascertained by linkage with the National Death Registry. Competing risk models were used to calculate the adjusted sub-distribution hazards (aSHR) for LTFU for pre-ART and ART-patients, with death considered as a competing risk. Results: A total of 157,026 patients registered in care and were included in analyses. The cumulative incidence of LTFU in pre-ART patients at 1 year was 10.2%, whereas in ART-patients it was 12.8%. Among pre-ART patients, younger age (<30 versus ≥45 years, aSHR 1.60, 95% CI 1.49, 1.72), less advanced HIV stage (aSHR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21, 1.37) and higher CD4+ T-cell count (≥350 versus <100, aSHR 6.31, 95% CI 5.74, 6.95) had a higher chance of LTFU. ART-patients with high baseline CD4+ T-cell count (CD4 ≥350 versus CD4 <50, aSHR 2.06, 95% CI 1.97, 2.15) and non-advanced HIV stage had increased risk of LTFU. Conclusions: Our findings provide new evidence of the LTFU rate in Thai HIV-infected patients in NAP. Emphasis needs to be placed on improving follow-up in all patients with higher CD4+ T-cell counts. LTFU will be important to monitor as programmes move to commence ART regardless of CD4+ T-cell count."
"Microscopic leaf constant numbers of Chromolaena odorata in Thailand  2018 Phcog.Net.Introduction: Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King and H. Rob. (syn. Eupatorium odoratum L.), commonly known as Siam Weed, Christmas Bush, or Common Floss Flower, is a species in family Asteraceae. It has been widely used as medicinal plants for a long time. In Thailand, C. odorata is locally used to treat skin diseases and insect bites. Leave juice from the crushed leaves can be used as a haemostatic and anti-inflammatory in the treatment of skin wounds. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the leaf constant values of microscopic characters of leaf in term of stomatal number, stomatal index, epidermal cell number, trichome number, trichome index and oil gland number of C. odorata in Thailand. Method: Microscopic evaluation of leaf constants are frequency used for the medicinal plant samples. Leaf constant numbers used to identify between some closely related species. Light microscope (LM) attached a digital camera and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used in this study. Results and Conclusion: The results showed anomocytic stomata and multicellular non-glandular trichomes on both upper and lower epidermis of C. odorata, while oil glands were found on only lower epidermis of the leaf. The microscopic leaf constant numbers of C. odorata were established and could be used for the species identification of C. odorata in Thailand."
"L2 Acquisition of Wh-operator Movement in English Open Interrogatives by L1 Thai Learners: A case of the failed functional features hypothesis  Common Ground Research Networks, Pairoj Kunanupatham, Nattama PongpairojBased on the Failed Functional Features Hypothesis (FFFH), the current study aims at investigating L1 Thai learners' acquisition of the wh-operator movement in English open interrogatives. The two primary objectives included: (1) to explore whether the wh-operator movement in English can be acquired by L1 Thai learners; and (2) to account for the data of the FFFH. Due to the non-existence of the strong uninterpretable [uwh] feature in Thai, it is hypothesized that L1 Thai learners of English fail to acquire English open interrogatives by means of the operator movement and that a variability in English open interrogatives is evident in both production and perception. A Question Formation Task (QFT) and a Grammaticality Judgement Task (GJT) were administered to twenty intermediate and twenty advanced L1 Thai learners. The findings reveal that, in spite of their low suppliance rates of resumptive pronouns in the QFT, both L2 groups persistently failed to detect the presence of resumptive pronouns in the GJT, with rejection rates that were remarkably lower than those of the native controls. Furthermore, they seemed to produce or accept open interrogatives irrespective of the presence of resumptive pronouns, probably owing to the optional pronoun retention in Thai. In addition, an asymmetry between subject extraction and object extraction was found, possibly owing to processing difficulties posed by the former. The study, therefore, concludes that L1 Thai learners cannot acquire the wh-operator movement in English, driven by the strong uninterpretable [uwh] feature absent in Thai, thus lending vigorous support to the FFFH."
"The relationships between affect, emotion regulation, and overeating in Thai Culture  2018, Behavioral Science Research Institute. This study aimed to explore whether the relationships between affect and overeating, observed previously in individualistic cultures, could be generalized to a collectivistic culture where the emotional display rules differ. Focusing on Thai population, the study specifically investigated: (1) whether dietary disinhibition would mediate the relationships between affect and overeating behavior, and (2) whether emotion regulation would moderate this relationship. To this end, 298 participants (aged 18-24 years) were recruited from universities in the Bangkok metropolitan region. All participants were asked to complete pen-and-paper measures of affect, emotion regulation, dietary disinhibition, and overeating behaviors. Using a mediated-moderation analysis, results showed that only negative, but not positive, affect had a direct effect on overeating behavior (β = .25, t(295) = 5.20, p < .001). This relationship was mediated by participants' dietary disinhibition (R 2 = .36, β = 82.85, t(295) = 5.20, p < .001). Finally, emotion regulation moderated the relationships between negative affect (β = -.10, t(292) = -2.35, p = .02), dietary disinhibition, and overeating behavior (β= .12, t(292) = 2.49, p = .01). The findings suggest that even in collectivistic cultures, the ability to regulate emotions still serves as a protective factor against excessive food intake. These findings demonstrate the importance of an individual's emotion, emotion regulation, and cognitive pattern that could influence eating behavior. Consequently, the findings have implications for the development of obesity interventions in related cultural settings."
"Hydrothermal and enzymatic treatments of pineapple waste for energy production Copyright  2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Nowadays, alternative energy from biomass has become more popular globally. Pineapple waste, one of the non-edible biomass sources from agricultural waste, can be used as an alternative source of sugar for ethanol production. However, the production of glucose from cellulose using conventional process would generally be retarded by lignin content. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the hydrothermal treatment followed by the enzymatic treatment on the cellulose conversion with the presence of different lignin contents and compare the result with conventional method. Also, the physical structures of solid residues from both techniques are analyzed and compared. The results show that the hydrothermal treatment at 185°C followed by the enzymatic treatment can convert pineapple waste to a higher amount of monosaccharide, which is composed of glucose and fructose. Furthermore, the combined treatments can provide up to 23.90 % higher for the glucose yield and 226.7 % higher for the fructose yield than that of the pure enzymatic treatment. Furthermore, the reduction in the lignin content from 20.43 % to 10.88 % by weight can substantially enhance the glucose yield up to 23.90 %. Moreover, the hydrothermal treatment process can decompose the lignin structure between each cellulose strand. Without this treatment, the lignin structure will not be broken down and retard the effectiveness of enzymatic treatment."
"Scenario planning for low carbon tourism city: A case study of NAN Copyright  2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Industrialization alongside urbanization is proceeding rapidly in worldwide that tend to generate massive greenhouse gas emissions. The conflict among rapid urbanization and sustainable development will become increasingly serious. Moreover, the current model of urbanization looks unsustainable for transition to a low-carbon city. Ecotourism is one of the sustainable development approach for tourism city to achieve the low carbon city target. This concept provides many benefits to the environment, economies and local people, especially in developing countries in ASEAN, such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Nan Province has been a popular tourist destination in Thailand over the past few years. Nan aimed to develop province to be ecotourism city and promoting sustainable natural resource management and conservation. This province risks failing to meet ecotourism target due to a rapid growth of tourism. In order to minimize the risks of ecotourism development in Nan, scenario planning was selected as an important tool to help Nan province to prepare and plan for the future development. Four scenarios were designed to present plausible alternative futures of Nan under particular assumption of key drivers and important uncertainties. STEEP analysis was selected to identify the key driving forces to include within the scenarios. In addition, the indicators for monitoring development of low carbon tourism city were also proposed."

Moreover, the investigation provides guidance for further research in designing online learning environments to enhance the self-efficacy of learners."
"Thai women’s experiences of and responses to domestic violence  2018 Chuemchit et al.Purpose: Domestic violence has been linked to many health consequences. It can impact women’s mental, physical, sexual, and reproductive health, and all of these effects can be long lasting. Despite the growing awareness of the deleterious effects of domestic violence in Thailand, there have been few nation-wide studies that have examined the issue and its consequences. In fact, Thailand has not examined intimate partner violence incidence for the past 20 years. This study aimed to investigate the consequences of domestic violence across the country. Subjects and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in four areas of Thailand: central, southern, northern, and northeastern. One province in each area was selected by simple random sampling techniques. One thousand four hundred and forty-four married or cohabiting females in a heterosexual union, aged 20–59 years, were included in the sample and were interviewed about their experiences of psychological, physical, and sexual violence by their male partners. Results: One thousand four hundred and forty-four women completed the interviews. Sixteen percent of respondents encountered domestic violence in its various psychological, physical, or sexual forms. In the majority of cases, all forms of domestic violence were exerted repeatedly. Four-fifths of women who faced domestic violence reported that it had an impact on their physical and mental health as well as employment. This study also found that half of the domestic violence survivors reported their children had witnessed violent situations. These women exercised four coping strategies to deal with their domestic violence: 1) counseling; 2) requesting help from others; 3) fighting back; and 4) running away from home. Conclusion: The findings confirm that domestic violence has implications that extend beyond health and result in the deterioration of the quality of women’s lives. These results underscore that domestic violence is a serious problem that must be addressed in Thai society."
"Does Thailand fulfill the ASEAN requirements for foreign direct investment under partial liberalization in electricity industry? This paper explores Thailand's partial liberalization of the electricity industry and to what extent is a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) allowed in the electricity sector. As Thailand is an ASEAN Member State, the paper aims to review whether the partial liberalization under the ESB model is consistent with the commitments of the ASEAN. The paper examines both the ACIA and the AFAS, and it finds that Thailand has no commitment under both agreements relevant to entry of a FDI in its electricity sector. However, Thailand already allows the entry of a FDI in the power generation business which is aligned with the principles of market access and National Treatment that fulfill the obligations under the ACIA and the AFAS in case Thailand will make any commitments in the future. It is noted that electricity transmissions and the distribution and supply businesses are still prohibited for both Thai and foreign investors."

"Factors related to hypertensive phase after glaucoma drainage device implantation  2018, Dove Medical Press Ltd. All rights reserved.Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate factors related to hypertensive phase (HP) after glaucoma drainage device (GDD) implantation. Patients and methods: Retrospective charts review of glaucoma patients who underwent GDD implantation and completed 12 months of follow-up at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital since 2004 was performed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of HP. The data were analyzed for factors associated with HP. The surgical outcomes including surgical failure, post-operative visual acuity (VA), post-operative number of medications, post-operative intraocular pressure (IOP), and post-operative complication were compared between the two groups. Results: Seventy-two patients were included. Most were diagnosed with secondary glaucoma (N=51, 70.8%), and Baerveldt was the most implanted GDD (N=49, 68.1%). Mean ± SD of IOP was significantly lower: 27.1±9.6 mmHg at pre-operation and 13.7±59 mmHg at 12-month follow-up (p<0.001). HP was identified in 38/72 patients (52.8%, 95% CI 40.7–64.7). Risk factor of HP was pre-operative VA equal or better than 20/70 (p=0.021, OR 7.5; 95% CI 1.4–41.4). Presence of underlying heart disease (patients in this group had taken anti-platelets) was found as a protective factor for HP (p=0.027, OR 0.06; 95% CI 0.00–0.72). It was speculated that the anti-inflammatory effect of the anti-platelets, particularly aspirin, may be responsible for controlling inflammation and retarding fibrosis formation around drainage implants. Failure rate at 12 months was 24/72 (33%). There was no difference in all surgical outcomes between the two groups. Survival analysis also showed no significant difference between HP and non-HP group. Conclusion: HP commonly occurred after GDD implantation. Pre-operative VA was a risk factor for the development of HP, whereas presence of underlying heart disease was a protective factor. No association between HP and surgical outcomes was identified."
"Genetic diversity of captive eastern sarus crane in Thailand inferred from mitochondrial control region sequence and microsatellite DNA markers  2018 by Chulalongkorn University.The eastern sarus crane, Grus antigone sharpii, was reported to be extinct from Thailand, thus a captive breeding is a crucial step to reintroduce the crane population back into the wild. However, genetic diversity in a captive population is also of immense importance as well as the increase number of individuals. This study aimed to assess genetic diversity of captive crane populations at Khao Kheow Open Zoo and Bangpra Water Bird Breeding Station, Chonburi Province, using both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. Mitochondrial control regions of G. a. sharpii were sequenced (1,003 bps.) and 10 microsatellite primer pairs isolated from blue crane were used to screen for polymorphic loci using cross-species amplification. The results revealed that captive G. a. sharpii show high haplotype diversity (0.915) and heterozygosity (mean HE = 0.77 and HO = 0.85), with low genetic differentiation (FST = 0.042) and inbreeding (FIS = -0.095). Moreover, Bayesian analysis using STRUCTURE suggested that the two captive populations are genetically similar and shared many common alleles (K = 1), which also supported by haplotype network and phylogenetic analyses. Therefore, these captive crane populations may be suitable for future breeding and reintroduction programs."
"Indigenous saccharomyces cerevisiae strains from coconut inflorescence sap: Characterization and use in coconut wine fermentation  2018, Chiang Mai University.This study isolated Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains from coconut inflorescence sap and evaluated their suitability for coconut wine fermentation. Twenty-six S. cerevisiae strains were isolated from coconut inflorescence sap in Thailand. They were identified based on their morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, as well as by sequence analysis of the D1/D2 region of the large-subunit ribosomal RNA gene. All 26 isolates grew at 37°C and 11 strains (42%) produced ethanol at more than 50 g/L from 180 g/L glucose containing medium at 30°C. Sensory evaluation using a nine-point hedonic scale of the coconut wines fermented by five selected yeast strains from 23°Brix coconut juice showed no significant differences (p = > 0.05) in the color and clarity except for the wine fermented by strain NL010, whose flavor profile and overall acceptance were rated exceptionally high. Thus, coconut inflorescence sap is a potential source of autochthonous S. cerevisiae strains for coconut wine fermentation."
"Paleogeographic reconstruction and history of the sea level change at Sam Roi Yot National Park, Gulf of Thailand  2018 by Chulalongkorn University.In this study, the paleogeography and the natural history of sea level change was reconstructed for the Sam Roi Yot National Park, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Gulf of Thailand, one of the tropical natural conservation areas. Beach ridge sand and marine shells attached to sea notches were dated by Optically Stimulated Luminescence and conventional C14 radiocarbon techniques. The paleo-landform features recognized in the inland region of the national park were a coastal bay, beach ridge plain and tombolos. The semi-circle paleo-coastal bay possibly developed at the same time as the upper sea notch, some 6,500-6,000 y ago. These inland landforms have subsequently become a tidal flat after tombolos connected the limestone islands to the mainland. This process coincided with the formation of the middle sea notch, 3,000-1,000 y ago. A total of 163 shells were collected from 10 locations with different environments, including the beach ridge, swale, tidal flat and former tidal flat. They were classified into 57 species (12 Gastropoda and 45 Bivalvia species). Anadara inaequivalvis, Anadara pilula, Saccostrea cucullata, Anomalocardia squamosal, Meretrix meretrix and Dosinia cretacea were found extensively in most areas. All these species indicated a mangrove environment to the intertidal zone."
"Serum miR-29a and miR-122 as Potential Biomarkers for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Copyright Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.BACKGROUND: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an over accumulation of triglyceride in the liver without alcohol consumption. Its major cause is insulin resistance. Patients with NAFLD can develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene silencing. Previous research reported that miR-29 family (a, b and c) and miR-122 have an important role in regulating insulin resistance related to NAFLD. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate that miR-29 and miR-122 can be possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD. METHOD: Serum samples were collected from 58 NAFLD patients and 34 healthy controls. MiRNAs were extracted from serum by using microRNA purification kit followed by polyuridylation, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR. Also, we analyzed the correlation between miR-29 and miR-122 and level of liver inflammation in NAFLD patients. RESULTS: We found that the serum miR-29a levels in NAFLD patients were significantly lower (P = 0.006) than the control group, while miR-29c levels were unchanged, and miR-29b levels were undetectable. However, we found that serum miR-122 levels in NAFLD patients were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those found in the control group. For miR-29a, the area under curve (AUC) was 0.679 (P = 0.0065) with 60.87% sensitivity and 82.35% specificity. For miR-122, the AUC was 0.831 (P < 0.0001) with 75.00% sensitivity and 82.35% specificity. Interestingly, the levels of serum miR- 122 were significantly different between patients without steatohepatitis (NAS < 4) and steatohepatitis (NAS ≥ 4), indicating that the levels of miR-122 were related to the severity of NAFLD. CONCLUSION: The levels of miR-29a and miR-122 might be beneficial and compelling as possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD."
"Optimum operating parameters of CO2 sorption in turbulent fluidized bed regime using potassium carbonate supported on gamma alumina solid sorbent  The Royal Society of Chemistry.The promising solid sorbent, potassium carbonate (K2CO3) supported on gamma alumina (γ-Al2O3) was prepared through impregnation by insertion into the sorption turbulent riser to determine the optimum operating parameters. A sorption temperature of 60 °C, superficial gas velocity of 0.22 m s−1, and initial sorbent loading of 5 g were determined to be the optimum conditions so that 93 percent of the actual loaded K2CO3 could react with CO2 to obtain the highest CO2 sorption capacity at 279.95 mg of CO2/g of K2CO3. 23 factorial design plus center points were used to analyze the result of the main effect and interaction between the operating parameters. The sorption temperature, superficial gas velocity, and sorbent loading all impacted the response parameter. From the obtained interpretation, interaction between sorption temperature and superficial gas velocity, as well as between sorption temperature and initial sorbent loading, portrayed statistically significant effects on CO2 capture capacity. Calculations showed that concentration of treated gas was greatly reduced. This distinguished breakthrough behavior provided a step toward designing a continuous reactor to maximize CO2 capture. However, one major obstacle for this design was the persisting formation of hydrated potassium dawsonite, a side product of conventional heat regeneration."
Prioritizing factors affecting traffic volume of public-private partnership infrastructure projects  2018 Phong Thanh Nguyen et. al.Public-private partnership (PPP) is an effective alternative for raising capital for infrastructure projects and has been a popular trend in developing countries recently. A key factor that affects the success of PPP transportation projects is traffic demand because it directly influences project revenue. Inaccurate traffic demand estimates may lead to financial difficulties for private partners. This paper applies fuzzy extended analytic method (FEAM) to prioritize critical factors that affect traffic volume of PPP infrastructure projects. The results benefit both public and private sectors for realizing key factors for the success of PPP infrastructure project implementation.
"Uplift of very sensitive soft clay due to pile driving  2018 International Association of Lowland Technology. All rights reserved.The subsoil of Samutprakarn province in Thailand consists of thick sensitive very soft clay layer. The construction, such as pile driving and excavation work would lead to reduce the shear strength of very soft clay or induce the excess pore pressure on very soft clay. This paper presents the results of pile driving around the press pit reinforced concrete structure which was excavated and constructed on the very soft sensitive clay. The pile driving effect surrounding the press pit caused the uplift of press pit. The uplift of press pit was investigated by additional soil investigation, piezometer installation as well as coring the base slab of press pit. The investigation result was analyzed for clarifying the uplift behaviors before remedial work. At present, the remedial work was already completed."
"Weakly singular BIEM for analysis of cracks embedded in symmetric elastic whole space  2018 International Association of Lowland Technology. All rights reserved.In this paper, a weakly singular boundary integral equation method is developed for the stress analysis of an anisotropic, linearly elastic, cracked whole space possessing a plane of symmetry. This study should offer an alternative powerful tool essential for the modeling of both near-surface and deeply embedded defects in a rock/soil medium. A system of governing equations is established using a pair of weakly singular, weakform, displacement and traction integral equations for the cracked whole space along with the symmetric condition. The final equations contain only unknown crack-face data in a lowerhalf of the whole space. In addition to their capability to treat cracks of arbitrary shape, material anisotropy and general loading conditions, all involved kernels are weakly singular allowing all integrals to be interpreted in the sense of Riemann. A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method together with the Galerkin approximation is implemented to solve the governing integral equations for the unknown crack-face data. To further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme, special basis functions are introduced to approximate the near-front field and the interpolation technique is adopted to evaluate all kernels for generally anisotropic materials. The solved crack-face displacement data is then utilized to postprocess for the essential fracture information along the crack front. Various scenarios are employed to verify the proposed technique and a selected set of results is presented to demonstrate its accuracy and computational robustness."
"Doxorubicin-conjugated dexamethasone induced MCF-7 apoptosis without entering the nucleus and able to overcome MDR-1-induced resistance  2018 Chaikomon et al.Background: Doxorubicin (DOX) is the most widely used chemotherapeutic agent that has multimodal cytotoxicity. The main cytotoxic actions of DOX occur in the nucleus. The emergence of drug-resistant cancer cells that have the ability to actively efflux DOX out of the nucleus, and the cytoplasm has led to the search for a more effective derivative of this drug. Materials and methods: We created a new derivative of DOX that was derived via simple conjugation of the 3′ amino group of DOX to the dexamethasone molecule. Results: Despite having a lower cytotoxic activity in MCF-7 cells, the conjugated product, DexDOX, exerted its actions in a manner that was different to that of DOX. DexDOX rapidly induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis without entering the nucleus. Further analysis showed that Dex-DOX increased cytosolic oxidative stress and did not interfere with the cell cycle. In addition, the conjugated product retained its cytotoxicity in multidrug resistance-1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells that had an approximately 16-fold higher resistance to DOX. Conclusion: We have synthesized a new derivative of DOX, which has the ability to overcome multidrug resistance-1-induced resistance. This molecule may have potential as a future chemotherapeutic agent."
"Development of content-based metadata scheme of classical poetry in thai national historical corpus  Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.This paper addresses a conceptual framework and an application of a content-based metadata scheme of classical poetry currently deployed in the Thai National Historical Corpus (TNHC). The corpus aims to collect texts representing the Thai language from different historical periods. Applying a metadata modeling approach, the variation of classical Thai poetry is analyzed in terms of components in every verse form. The compositions of wak, baat, stanza, paragraph, and chapter are identified as main elements for the conceptual framework. For theatrical works, essential elements including <sound> and <stage> tags were also implemented. TNHC selectively applied certain standard TEI encoding elements, in XML format, to describe the content structure of the poetry. This is an early attempt to develop a metadata scheme for classical Thai poetry. There are still a number of opportunities to improve the discovery and interoperability of the collection as well as to enhance the data entry process, data management, and retrieval performance of the corpus."
"A visual content analysis of Thai government’s census infographics  Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.This paper reports an approach to visual content analysis and findings of the initial phase of developing the coding sheet for analyzing government infographics in Thailand. It sought to examine story topics and visual displays appeared in census infographics at the outset. All 108 infographics from the National Statistical Office (NSO) website were chosen to be studied. There were two expert coders responsible for a pilot coding. The first expert was designated to analyze the contents, and another coder was assigned to identify narrative visualization used in the census infographics. Overall, the preliminary findings reveal that the NSO focused on the creation of static infographics in which their contents, together with the static visuals, represented census data in a single page. Although the NSO static infographics were the most common format found for its visual communication, further studies are required to examine different kinds of infographics generated by other Thai government agencies dealing with varied information other than census data."
"Synthesis and investigation of tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrins for electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.We report the synthesis and electrochemical properties of freebase tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin and its complexes of Zn(ii), Co(ii), Ni(ii), Cu(ii) and Sn(iv) towards electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). Based on cyclic voltammetry, it is shown that central metals significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance in the reduction of CO2 in terms of reduction potential and catalytic current enhancement. At an applied potential of -1.90 V vs. an Ag/AgCl quasi reference electrode for 20 h, the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 realized by Zn(ii)- and Cu(ii)-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrins to carbon monoxide resulted in faradaic efficiencies of around 48% and 33%, respectively."
"Enhancing Antibacterial Activity against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus by Combination of Tetracycline with Selected Compounds  2018 The Chemical Society of JapanTwelve selected compounds were evaluated for their MIC values against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus by broth microdilution method. The highest antibacterial activities were observed from 4 with MIC values of 0.50 and 0.99 ¯g/mL, followed by 5 at 1.88 and 0.94 ¯g/mL, respectively. The synergistic effect of those selected compounds with tetracycline was evaluated by chekerboard method. Their activity enhancement with tetracycline in combination was observed compared with using a single compound. The combination of 6 with tetracycline displayed the most potent synergistic effect to enhance the antibacterial activity against P. acnes while the combination of 9 and tetracycline revealed the most competent against S. aureus."
"Information-theoretic broadcast with dishonest majority for long messages  International Association for Cryptologic Research 2018.Byzantine broadcast is a fundamental primitive for secure computation. In a setting with n parties in the presence of an adversary controlling at most t parties, while a lot of progress in optimizing communication complexity has been made for t< n/ 2, little progress has been made for the general case t< n, especially for information-theoretic security. In particular, all information-theoretic secure broadcast protocols for ℓ -bit messages and t< n and optimal round complexity O(n) have, so far, required a communication complexity of O(ℓn2). A broadcast extension protocol allows a long message to be broadcast more efficiently using a small number of single-bit broadcasts. Through broadcast extension, so far, the best achievable round complexity for t< n setting with the optimal communication complexity of O(ℓn) is O(n4) rounds. In this work, we construct a new broadcast extension protocol for t< n with information-theoretic security. Our protocol improves the round complexity to O(n3) while maintaining the optimal communication complexity for long messages. Our result shortens the gap between the information-theoretic setting and the computational setting, and between the optimal communication protocol and the optimal round protocol in the information-theoretic setting for t< n."
"The Polymorphisms at PRSS1-PRSS2 and MORC4 Loci and the Risk of Post-ERCP Pancreatitis  2018 Phonthep Angsuwatcharakon et al.Background and Aim. The risks of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) are identified as patient- and procedure-related factors. However, the genetic contribution for PEP is still unclear. Recent data show that the polymorphisms of PRSS1-PRSS2 (rs10273639) and MORC4 (rs12688220) are associated with recurrent acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. We aim to evaluate the association between these polymorphisms and post-ERCP pancreatitis in order to improve better prognosis and better care for these patients. Methods. This is a retrospective, case-control study which includes 49 cases and 97 controls that are age-, procedure-, and risk of PEP-matched with the cases in 1: 2 fashion. The PEP was diagnosed and graded for severity according to the standard consensus, and the risk factors of PEP were identified according to the ESGE guideline. Polymorphisms at rs10273639 and rs12688220 were evaluated by TaqMan technique and were identified in 133 (40 cases and 93 controls) and 146 patients, respectively. Results. The demographic data between 2 groups are not significantly different. The genotype frequencies of PRSS1-PRSS2 (TT, TC, and CC) are 26, 13, and 1 vs. 67, 25, and 1 in cases and controls, respectively (p=0.642). The genotype frequencies of MORC4 in female (TT, TC, and CC) are 8, 23, and 5 vs. 12, 26, and 21 in cases and controls, respectively (p=0.071). The genotype frequencies of MORC4 in male (T and C) are 5 and 8 vs. 21 and 17 in cases and controls, respectively (p=0.468). The allelic frequencies of MORC4 in combination of both genders (T, C) are 44 and 41 vs. 71 and 84 in cases and control, respectively (p=0.431). In PEP cases, the allelic frequencies of PRSS1-PRSS2 (T and C) are 59 and 13 vs. 6 and 2 in mild and moderate/severe cases, respectively (p=0.633). The allelic frequencies of MORC4 (T and C) are 38 and 39 vs. 4 and 4 in mild and moderate/severe cases, respectively (p=0.972). Conclusion. Polymorphisms at PRSS1-PRSS2 and MORC4 are not associated with the risk or severity of post-ERCP pancreatitis."
"Early Life Trauma Predicts Affective Phenomenology and the Effects are Partly Mediated by Staging Coupled with Lowered Lipid-Associated Antioxidant Defences  2018 Michael Maes, published by De Gruyter.Early life trauma (ELT) may drive mood disorder phenomenology, nitro-oxidative pathways and impairments in semantic memory. There are no data regarding the impact of ELT on affective phenomenology and whether these pathways are mediated by staging or lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defences. This study examined healthy controls (n=54) and patients with affective disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders (n=118). ELT was assessed using the Child Trauma Questionnaire. In addition, we measured affective phenomenology and assayed advanced oxidation protein products; malondialdehyde, paraoxonase 1 (CMPAase) activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. ELT was associated into with increased risk for mood and comorbid anxiety disorders and a more severe phenomenology, including staging characteristics, depression and anxiety severity, suicidal behaviours, type of treatments, disabilities, body mass index, smoking behaviour and hsCRP, as well as lowered health-related quality of life, antioxidant defences and semantic memory. The number of mood episodes and CMPAase/HDL-cholesterol levels could be reliably combined into a new vulnerability staging-biomarker index, which mediates in part the effects of ELT on affective phenomenology and oxidative stress. Moreover, the effects of female sex on mood disorders and affective phenomenology are mediated by ELT. The cumulative effects of different ELT drive many aspects of affective phenomenology either directly or indirectly through effects of staging and/or lipid-associated antioxidant defences. The results show that children, especially girls, with ELT are at great risk to develop mood disorders and more severe phenotypes of affective disorders."
"Efficacy of 1,550-nm erbium-glass fractional laser treatment and its effect on the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 and Wnt/b-catenin in androgenetic alopecia  2018 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: A new treatment for androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a 1,550-nm erbium-glass (Er:Glass) fractional laser. The wound healing process associated with this treatment is believed to be due to the stimulation of hair regrowth. Both the Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) proteins and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are important molecules that promote new hair growth. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 1,550-nm Er:Glass fractional laser treatment and determine the gene expression of IGF-1 and Wnt/b-catenin in patients with AGA. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with AGA were enrolled. They received 12 treatments at 2-week intervals. A scalp biopsy was performed to evaluate mRNA levels of Wnt10A and IGF-1. Histopathologic samples were collected. RESULTS: Significant increases in hair count and shaft diameter that occurred from Month 4 until the end of the study were observed. Histological results showed increases in the follicular unit, anagen hair count, and the anagen:telogen ratio. No up-regulation of Wnt10A and IGF-1 mRNA was observed. CONCLUSION: The 1,550-nm Er:Glass fractional laser treatment can increase hair density and shaft diameter in patients with AGA. The mechanisms by which 1,550-nm Er:Glass laser treatment induces new hair growth may not be limited to Wnt10A/b-catenin or IGF-1 expression."
"Fabrication of ABS/Graphene oxide composite filament for fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D Printing  2018 C. Aumnate et al.Additive manufacturing, the so-called three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a revolutionary emerging technology. Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most used 3D printing technology in which the melted filament is extruded through the nozzle and builds up layer by layer onto the build platform. The layers are then fused together and solidified into final parts. Graphene-based materials have been positively incorporated into polymers for innovative applications, such as for the mechanical, thermal, and electrical enhancement. However, to reach optimum properties, the graphene fillers are necessary to be well dispersed in polymers matrix. This study aims to emphasise the interest of producing ABS/graphene oxide (GO) composites for 3D printing application. The ABS/GO composite filaments were produced using dry mixing and solvent mixing methods before further melt extruded to investigate the proper way to disperse GO into ABS matrix. The ABS/GO composite filament with 2 wt.% of GO, prepared from the solvent mixing method, was successfully printed into a 3D model. By adding GO, the tensile strength and Young's modulus of ABS can be enhanced. However, the ABS/GO composite filament that was prepared via the dry mixing method failed to print. This could be attributed to the aggregation of GO, leading to the die clogging and failure of the printing process."
"Tuning the reactivity of copper complexes supported by tridentate ligands leading to two-electron reduction of dioxygen  The Royal Society of Chemistry.A series of copper complexes bearing polypyridyl tridentate ligands have been prepared to fine tune their reactivity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). During the process of preparation of our copper complexes, we successfully obtained two new crystal structures which are [Cu2(μ-Cl)2(adpa)2](ClO4)2 (2b) and [Cu2(addpa)(CH3CN)2(ClO4)2](ClO4)2 (3a) and a new structure [Cu2(addpa)(CH3CN)2(H2O)2](ClO4)4 (3b) captured after the catalytic ORR. Electrochemical studies and stoichiometric chemical reduction of copper(ii) complexes by ascorbic acid indicated that the presence of an anthracene unit helps to facilitate the reduction of Cu(ii) as well as the stabilisation of Cu(i) species. Regarding oxygen activation, the dinuclear Cu(i) complex 3a showed significantly higher ORR activity than its analogous mononuclear complex 2a. Complex 3a was also found to be relatively robust and competent in catalytic O2 reduction. The observed H2O2 product after this catalysis, together with the data obtained from DFT calculations supported that 3a exhibited a 2H+, 2e− catalytic activity towards the ORR as opposed to the expected 4H+, 4e− process usually found in copper complexes with tridentate ligands. The proton (H+) source for this process was expected from ascorbic acid which also serves as a reducing agent in this reaction. This work highlighted an approach for tuning the ORR activity of the copper complexes by the introduction of a conjugated-π moiety to the supporting ligand."
"Falls among physically active elderly in senior housings, Bangkok, Thailand: Situations and perceptions  2018 Maneeprom et al.Purpose: A mixed-method study aimed to assess situations in which falls occur including prevalence and associated risk factors of falls among physically active elderly who are at risk of experiencing a fall in senior housings, Bangkok, Thailand, and their perceptions regarding falls. Patients and methods: In the first phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 64 physically active elderly senior housing residents. Data on sociodemographics, health status, Barthel Index (BI) of activities of daily living, and fall experiences were collected through face-to-face interviews. Data on balance scores were obtained from Time Up and Go (TUG) test and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). In the second phase, a qualitative study was conducted on 41 physically active elderly who had experienced falls. Data regarding perception on falls, fall preventions, and fall management, were gathered through in-depth interviews from November 2017 to December 2017. Results: The prevalence of falls among participants in senior housings was 64.1%. Univariate analysis found that a higher BI was associated with fall (P<0.004). Multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression showed that a higher BI (OR=6.00, 95% CI=1.24–29.10) together with ≥2 environmental hazards (OR=6.33, 95% CI=1.24–32.29) were associated with fall. The result from content analysis indicated that the elderly were aware that they were at risk of fall. In addition, the elderly also perceived that fall could be avoided even though they did not know how to prevent it. Conclusion: The prevalence of fall among physically active elderly in senior housings was relatively high. A higher BI scale and having ≥2 environmental hazards were associated risk factors of falls. Although the elderly perceived that fall could be avoided, they did not know how to prevent it. The intervention that focuses on environmental modification, balancing enchantment, and education on fall prevention is highly required."
"Post occupancy evaluation model: Adaptive measure towards sustainable neighborhood development  2018 by MIP.Sustainable development is key to the strategic sustainability within a society. Sustainable neighbourhood development (SND) is a fundamental element of a sustainable community. However, SND on it own will certainly not permit all stakeholders, particularly the end-users, to efficiently address current or projected future issues that positioned beyond the extent of physical development scope. Thus, this research aims to explore whether pre-occupancy assessment criteria addresses the adaptive measures of sustainable dimension pillars (SDP) upon post-occupancy holistically. The research objective is to identify the post-occupancy sustainable criteria gap of SND. To achieve this, the research applied Stakeholders-Inclusion Approach using Post-Occupancy Evaluation Model (POEM) Handbook as measurement tool. This research seeks to measure and identify SDP gap on economic, social and environmental balance and responsive approach towards incremental improvements in SND at community and individual levels. The findings indicated that there are SDP adaptation gaps in post-occupied SND."
"Ductility of concrete beams reinforced with both fiber-reinforced polymer and steel tension bars  Copyright 2018 Japan Concrete Institute.This paper presents a numerical investigation of the mechanical performance and ductility of concrete beams reinforced by both fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) and steel tension reinforcement. Three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) analysis of beams with both FRP and steel reinforcement was conducted by first using ANSYS to verify the reliability of the FE analysis. The FE analysis can predict the mechanical behavior of the tested beams. To evaluate the ductility of the FRP-steel reinforced concrete (RC) beams considering various factors, such as the effects of the FRP on the steel reinforcement ratio, the location of the FRP reinforcement, the FRP type and the concrete compressive strength, on the mechanical performance of the beams, a parametric study was used to complement the FE analysis. Based on the parametric study, the conditions of the ratio of FRP to steel reinforcement, the location of the FRP reinforcement and the type of FRP reinforcement required to obtain reasonable ductility in practical use were presented."
"Biocompatible zwitterionic copolymer-stabilized magnetite nanoparticles: a simple one-pot synthesis, antifouling properties and biomagnetic separation  The Royal Society of Chemistry.A simple one-pot synthesis of biocompatible and antifouling magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4NPs) was developed. The process involves co-precipitation and in situ coating of zwitterionic copolymer poly[(methacrylic acid)-co-(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)] (PMAMPC). The influence of one-step and two-step coating methods on the performance of modified Fe3O4NP was investigated. The PMAMPC-Fe3O4NP with a narrow particle size distribution obtained from the two-step approach were highly stable in aqueous media within a wide range of pH. The particles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior with high saturation magnetization values so that they could be easily separated from solution by a magnet. Their antifouling characteristics against 2 selected proteins, lysozyme (LYZ) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), as a function of copolymer molecular weight and composition were also evaluated. Moreover, taking advantage of having carboxyl groups in the coated copolymer, the PMAMPC-Fe3O4NP were conjugated with a model biomolecular probe, biotin. The biotin-immobilized PMAMPC-Fe3O4NP were then tested for their specific capturing of a target molecule, streptavidin. The results have demonstrated the potential of PMAMPC-Fe3O4NP prepared by the two-step in situ coating method for probe immobilization and subsequent biomagnetic separation of target molecules. The fact that the developed functionalizable magnetite nanoparticles are biocompatible and antifouling also opens up the possibility of their use in other biomedical-relevant applications."
"Does sexism affect Thai women’s psychological and behavioural responses? The stereotype threat-buffering effect of mindfulness  The Author(s) 2018.Few studies have examined the linkage of perceived sexism with stereotype threat and psychological responses in a work setting and moderators that may buffer this negative effect. In Study 1, the relationships among perceived sexism, stereotype threat, and psychological responses were explored among Thai female employees (N = 296) in a self-report questionnaire study. The aim of Study 2 was to investigate whether mindfulness can mitigate the disastrous effect of sexism on performance, using an experimental design. In Study 1, the standard error of measurement (SEM) results observed a partial mediation effect of stereotype threat for the sexism-disidentification relationship, and sexism only had a significant direct effect on career aspirations. In Study 2, the interaction effect of sexism × mindfulness on the female participants’ reasoning test scores was significant, indicating that those with mindfulness practice performed better when being exposed to sexist behaviours. The current research provides additional information on understanding the impact of sexism on disengagement and decreased career aspirations among Thai female employees in male-dominated industries. In practice, Thai organisations should be concerned about the impact of sexism on disengagement and the protective factor of performance decrements by encouraging anti-sexist norms and fostering the cultivation of mindfulness through practice."
Defect Classification of Electronic Board Using Dense SIFT and CNN  2018 The Author(s).This paper proposes a new defect classification method of electronic board using Dense SIFT and CNN which can represent the effective features to the gray scale image. Proposed method does not use any reference image and effective keypoints are detected using Dense SIFT on the defect candidate region. Removing the feature points except defect region and Bag of Features are used to represent the histogram featureS. Dense SIFT and SVM are used to judge defect or not. CNN is further introduced to classify true or pseudo defect. Classification accuracy was evaluated and effectiveness of the proposed method is shown.
"Effects of combined lower thoracic epidural/ general anesthesia on pain control in patients undergoing elective lumbar spine surgery  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Objective. Our objective was to compare postoperative pain relief and operating field condition of single-shot, low-Thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia versus general anesthesia alone. Summary of Background Data. Prior studies have suggested that continuous epidural analgesia provides better postoperative pain relief and less intraoperative blood loss, but with the risk of the epidural catheter contaminating the surgical field. Methods. A total of 22 patients scheduled for elective lumbar spine surgery were enrolled and randomly allocated into two groups. Group B (block) received a single-shot epidural block with 0.25% bupivacaine plus 4mg of morphine with a total volume of 10 mL before receiving general anesthesia with desflurane, and cisatracurium. Group G (general) received general anesthesia alone with desflurane, cisatracurium, and any systemic analgesia deemed appropriate by the attending anesthesiologist. Postoperative pain score, opioid consumption, intraoperative blood loss, surgical field rating score, and other side effects were recorded at the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 24 hours postoperatively. Results. Both groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index, and American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status. Fentanyl consumption was significantly lower (P <.05) for group B (block) at the PACU and 24 hours. Mean fentanyl consumption at PACU was 20mg for group B and 85mg for group G. At 24 hours mean fentanyl consumption was 80mg for group B and 386mg for group G. Pain measured with numerical rating scale, surgical field rating score, blood loss, and complications were similar in both groups. Conclusion. Single-shot low-Thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia provides better pain control than general anesthesia alone."
"Assessment of diagnostic values among CA-125, RMI, HE4, and ROMA for cancer prediction in women with nonfunctional ovarian cysts  2018 Shina Oranratanaphan et al.Objectives. To evaluate the diagnostic performance among CA-125, RMI, HE4, and ROMA for cancer detection in women with nonfunctional ovarian cysts at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH). Secondary objective is to reconsider the proper cutoff value of HE4. Methods. This is a prospective analytic study in women with nonfunctional ovarian cysts larger than 3 cm who scheduled for surgery at KCMH during 3rd June 2015 to 31st May 2016. Ultrasonogram and blood sample collection were completed before the operation. Patients' demographic information and pathologic results were obtained. SPSS software version 17 was used for statistical evaluation. Results. A total of 281 participants were evaluated. 19.9% of them were malignant. Compared with CA-125, HE4 had lower sensitivity (53.4% vs. 87.9%) and NPV (89% vs. 93.6%) but higher specificity (97.8% vs. 46.2%) and PPV (86.1% vs. 29.8%). ROMA had slightly lower sensitivity (79.3% vs. 87.9%) and similar NPV (93.7% vs. 93.6%), but higher specificity (79.8% vs. 46.2%) and PPV (50.5% vs. 29.8%) compared with CA-125. The model that achieves the highest area under the ROC curve in differentiating benign versus malignant ovarian tumor was ROMA. Cutoff value of HE4 at 70 pMol/L (from 150 pMol/L) would give sensitivity 74.1% and specificity 86.5% that are comparable with ROMA. Conclusions. HE4 and ROMA had better performance (higher specificity, PPV) compared to CA-125 and RMI. HE4 at 70 pMol/L could be the new cutoff value for Thai women with ovarian cysts, giving higher sensitivity and specificity."
"Characteristics, mortality and outcomes at transition for adolescents with perinatal HIV infection in Asia Copyright  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe characteristics of perinatally HIV-infected adolescents (PHIVAs), factors associated with mortality, and outcomes at transition. Design: Ongoing observational database collating clinical data on HIV-infected children and adolescents in Asia. Methods: Data from 2001 to 2016 relating to adolescents (10-19 years) with perinatal HIV infection were analysed to describe characteristics at adolescent entry and transition and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens across adolescence. A competing risk regression analysis was used to determine characteristics at adolescent entry associated with mortality. Outcomes at transition were compared on the basis of age at cART initiation. Results: Of 3448 PHIVA, 644 had reached transition. Median age at HIV diagnosis was 5.5 years, cART initiation 7.2 years and transition 17.9 years. At adolescent entry, 35.0% hadCD4+ cell count less than 500 cells/ml and 51.1% had experience da WHO stage III/IV clinical event. At transition, 38.9% had CD4+ cell count less than 500copies/ml, and 53.4% had experienced a WHO stage III/IV clinical event. Mortality ratewas 0.71 per 100 person-years, with HIV RNA >1000copies/ml, CD4+ cell count less than 500cells/ml, height-for-ageorweight-for-agez-score less than - 2, historyofa WHO stage III/IV clinical event or hospitalization and at least second cART associated with mortality. For transitioning PHIVA, those who commenced cART age less than 5 years had better virologic and immunologic outcomes, though were more likely to be on at least second cART. Conclusion: Delayed HIV diagnosis and cART initiation resulted in considerable morbidity and poor immune status by adolescent entry. Durable first-line cART regimens to optimize disease control are key to minimizing mortality. Early cART initiation provides the best virologic and immunologic outcomes at transition."
"Foot function after surgically treated intraarticular calcaneal fractures: Correlation of clinical and pedobarographic results of 65 patients followed for 8 years Copyright  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Objectives: To correlate functional deficits after surgical treatment of displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures (DIACFs) as measured through dynamic pedobarography with clinical and radiographic long-term results. Design: Retrospective single-center study. Setting: Level 1 trauma center. Patients: Sixty-five patients with unilateral DIACFs, reexamined at an average of 8.1 years after surgery. Intervention: Internal fixation of DIACF with lateral plate or percutaneous screws. Main Outcome Measurements: Dynamic pedobarography, AOFAS, Zwipp, SF-36 scores, Foot Function Index, Böhler angle, and articular congruity. Results: When compared with the uninjured side, pedobarography of the operated foot revealed a significantly increased contact area of the hindfoot and midfoot, with a decreased contact area under first/ second metatarsal (MT) and first/second toe after DIACF. Maximum pressure and pressure time integral were significantly increased at the midfoot and lateral MT with a decrease under the hindfoot and first to second MT/toe. Midfoot pressure time integral correlated with the range of plantarflexion. Fracture classification correlated with MT 1 contact time. Hindfoot and MT contact times were negatively correlated with Böhler angle. Patients with the smallest side-to-side differences in pedobarogaphy had overall highest scores and significantly greater ankle/hindfoot range of motion at follow-up. Conclusions: Significant correlations were found between clinical and pedobarographic results. Increased contact areas and time at the midfoot indicating a lateral load shift correlated with inferior outcome and decreased subtalar motion. These results support the importance of reconstruction of the subtalar joint and overall bony morphology of the calcaneus with preservation of subtalar motion as necessary for global foot function."
"Value of serum zinc in diagnosing and assessing severity of liver disease in children with wilson disease Copyright  2018 by European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.Objectives: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare inborn error of copper metabolism with diverse manifestations. There has been no study of zinc (Zn), the copper's antagonist, in WD diagnosis and severity so far. Our aims were to evaluate serum Zn in WD and its correlation with the disease severity score (revised WD index). Although the ATP7B mutation analysis is highly accurate for WD diagnosis, it may not be readily available in a resource-limiting setting. We proposed a disease diagnostic score (Proposed WD diagnostic score) which incorporates serum Zn. Methods: Medical records of WD and non-WD children seen at King's College Hospital from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed for the selected parameters using the Proposed WD diagnostic score. Available serum Zn data in WD children before disease diagnosis and the calculated severity score were statistically analyzed. Diagnostic values of the Proposed WD diagnostic score were evaluated. Results: Serum Zn level was significantly lower in 8 WD-acute liver failure (ALF) (5.8 [4.1-8.3] μmol/L) compared to 18 WD-non-ALF (13.5 [6.1-22.2] μmol/L) and 9 ALF from indeterminate cause (9.8 [7.0-12.1] μmol/L) (P < 0.001). Serum Zn significantly correlated with the revised WD index (r = -0.554, P = 0.004). The Proposed WD diagnostic score that included serum Zn level as 1 of the parameters had sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 99.2%, respectively. Conclusions: Serum Zn is a novel parameter for diagnosis and correlates with severity of WD. The Proposed WD diagnostic score is useful while awaiting ATP7B mutation analysis."
"Scholarly publishing depends on peer reviewers  2018, Grupo de Investigacion en Atencion Farmaceutica. All rights reserved.The peer-review crisis is posing a risk to the scholarly peer-reviewed journal system. Journals have to ask many potential peer reviewers to obtain a minimum acceptable number of peers accepting reviewing a manuscript. Several solutions have been suggested to overcome this shortage. From reimbursing for the job, to eliminating pre-publication reviews, one cannot predict which is more dangerous for the future of scholarly publishing. And, why not acknowledging their contribution to the final version of the article published? PubMed created two categories of contributors: authors [AU] and collaborators [IR]. Why not a third category for the peer-reviewer?."
"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration: Intraocular inflammatory cytokines in the poor responder to ranibizumab treatment  2018 Pongsachareonnont et al.Purpose: To determine the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, platelet-derived growth factor, placental growth factor (PLGF), and other cytokines in the aqueous fluid of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration who respond poorly to ranibizumab. Patients and methods: This is an observational, prospective study. Thirty-two eyes from 30 patients were included in the study: 11 patients who responded poorly to ranibizumab and were switched to aflibercept (AF group), 8 patients who received ranibizumab and photodynamic therapy (PDT group), and 13 patients who responded to ranibizumab (control group). Aqueous fluid samples were collected for analysis of cytokine levels at baseline and after 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment. The effect of treatment on cytokine levels was compared between the study groups and between different time points using a linear mixed-effect regression model. Results: In the AF group, there was an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor-C, IL-7, and angiopoeitin-2 levels (P=0.01) and a decrease in intercellular adhesion molecule and IL-17 levels (P=0.01) between baseline and 3 months. After adjustment for age, sex, race, and type of lesion at baseline, the PLGF level was higher (P=0.02) and the IL-7 level was lower (P=0.04) in the ranibizumab non-responder group than in the ranibizumab responder group. Conclusion: Switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept did not reduce intraocular levels of angiogenesis cytokines, but resulted in improvement of central subfield thickness. PLGF levels were higher in poor responders to ranibizumab. The response of lesions to medication might be related to the stage of choroidal neovascularization.

"Identification of volatile compounds and selection of discriminant markers for elephant dung coffee using static headspace gas chromatography—mass spectrometry and chemometrics  2018 by the authors.Elephant dung coffee (Black Ivory Coffee) is a unique Thai coffee produced from Arabica coffee cherries consumed by Asian elephants and collected from their feces. In this work, elephant dung coffee and controls were analyzed using static headspace gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry (SHS GC-MS), and chemometric approaches were applied for multivariate analysis and the selection of marker compounds that are characteristic of the coffee. Seventy-eight volatile compounds belonging to 13 chemical classes were tentatively identified, including six alcohols, five aldehydes, one carboxylic acid, three esters, 17 furans, one furanone, 13 ketones, two oxazoles, four phenolic compounds, 14 pyrazines, one pyridine, eight pyrroles and three sulfur-containing compounds. Moreover, four potential discriminant markers of elephant dung coffee, including 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 2-furfurylfuran and 3-penten-2-one were established. The proposed method may be useful for elephant dung coffee authentication and quality control."
"Development of an open government data assessment model: User-centric approach to identify the weighted components in Thailand Copyright  2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.Social networking is rapidly growing to such an extent that it has become a driving force for the public and governments to access data. In 2015, the Thai government released a three-year digital government development plan as an e-government performance guideline. Several countries have conducted research on OGD assessment models (OGDAM). However, there is no research identifying enterprise architecture as the assessment component, which becomes the key activity to transform the digital government work process. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to develop an OGDAM suitable for Thailand that identified the components weight assessment from a user-centric approach that was calculated by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The validation of the developed OGDAM was performed by interviewing officials of top government management agencies responsible for e-government. Moreover, the model will adapt to the assessment system to allow public organisations to assess their open government data (OGD) progress in Thailand."
"Fuzzy AHP for drought risk assessment in lam Ta Kong watershed, the north-eastern region of Thailand  2018 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences. All rights reserved.Droughts occur from a combination of natural factors and human activities rather than just a single natural cause. Spatial factors have also heavily influenced the causes of draught. This study was conducted in the Lam Ta Kong watershed, Thailand. In this study, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method was applied to evaluate the risk of agricultural drought and the GIS technique was employed to give full consideration to the ambiguity and uncertainty of the agricultural drought risk. There are five risk factors to consider in the agricultural drought risk assessment and they are divided in a total of fifteen criteria: physical factors (slope gradient and elevation), climatic (rainfall and aridity index), soil (texture, drainage, fertility, erosion, and soil salinity), land utilization (land use and land cover) and water resources (precipitation days, stream density, distance from an irrigation canal, and groundwater volume). These criteria determine the weight and score used to evaluate their parental risk factors. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied together with the triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) method to assess the data obtained from the criteria to achieve the drought risk assessment. The results indicated that the overall risk of the Lam Ta Kong area was at a moderate risk of agricultural drought (50.45%), of which 15.63% of the total area was at a high risk of agricultural drought. Moreover, 0.40% of the total area located at the central part of the watershed was at a very high risk which was due to its saline soil with > 50% dense salt crust. This research indicated that the major factors causing droughts in the watershed were related to the soil factors, especially soil texture, soil fertility and soil salinity. These soil factors were considered as the driving factors of drought. The results of this study can be used for land use planning and water resource management in order to prepare for droughts in the watershed."
"Cultural tourism behaviors: Enhancing the influence of tourists’ perceptions on local thai food and culture  2018 Prapasawasdi et al.Background: Tourist behavior plays a principle role in preserving the cultural heritage and supporting the economy of the local community. Local food is a significant factor for tourists and an important cultural aspect distinguishing one country from one another. To understand tourists' food decision making, this study investigates tourists’ perceptions of local food. Methods: A mixed-method methodology used a concurrent transformative strategy. Qualitative research comprised in-depth interviews conducted with 15 local food specialists and 10 tourists; quantitative comprised survey structured questionnaires with a sample of 400 tourists travelling in Chiangmai, Thailand. Findings: The result revealed that tourists’ perceptions comprising attitude, subject norm, perceived value and expectation factors positively affected the perception toward local food information. Regression analysis suggested that the four variables contributed 53.4% to the variation of local food. By employing the standardized coefficients as mentioned, the linear regression model was Y = 0.424A-0.201S+0.428E+0.234P. Conclusion: Four factors affected tourists’ perceptions towards local food as follows: (1) expectation towards local food information via media, (2) attitude of tourists towards local food, (3) perceived value of local food with the benefit, belief and nutrition of local food, and (4) subject norm towards local food; local food experts influence to tourists. All the factors lead tourists to perceive in local food and culture."
"A simple and sensitive HPLC-fluorescence method for the determination of moxifloxacin in human plasma and its application in a pharmacokinetic study  2018 Govi-Verlag Pharmazeutischer Verlag GmbH. All Rights Reserved.A simple sample preparation technique coupled with the specific and sensitive fluorescence detection for the determination of moxifloxacin in human plasma was developed and fully validated. Levofloxacin was chosen as an internal standard. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a Shiseido C18 MGII (250×4.6mm i.d.; 5 μm) column under an isocratic mobile phase comprising of 50 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 2.4) ‒ acetonitrile (77:23, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Fluorescence detection was optimized for the determination of moxifloxacin in human plasma at an excitation wavelength of 296 nm and an emission wavelength of 504 nm. The total chromatographic run time was 8 min with the retention times of moxifloxacin and internal standard at 6.5 and 3.0 min, respectively. Calibration curves were established over the dynamic range of 20-3000 ng/mL. The analytical method was validated as per US-FDA and EMA guidelines for specificity, sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, hemolytic effect, lipemic effect, dilution integrity and stability. The validated analytical method was successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study of a single-dose oral administration of a moxifloxacin 400 mg tablet in Thai healthy volunteers."
"A lower limb rehabilitation robot in sitting position with a review of training activities  2018 Trinnachoke Eiammanussakul and Viboon Sangveraphunsiri.Robots for stroke rehabilitation at the lower limbs in sitting/lying position have been developed extensively. Some of them have been applied in clinics and shown the potential of the recovery of poststroke patients who suffer from hemiparesis. These robots were developed to provide training at different joints of lower limbs with various activities and modalities. This article reviews the training activities that were realized by rehabilitation robots in literature, in order to offer insights for developing a novel robot suitable for stroke rehabilitation. The control system of the lower limb rehabilitation robot in sitting position that was introduced in the previous work is discussed in detail to demonstrate the behavior of the robot while training a subject. The nonlinear impedance control law, based on active assistive control strategy, is able to define the response of the robot with more specifications while the passivity property and the robustness of the system is verified. A preliminary experiment is conducted on a healthy subject to show that the robot is able to perform active assistive exercises with various training activities and assist the subject to complete the training with desired level of assistance."
"Starbursts in and out of the star-formation main sequence  ESO 2018.Aims. We use high-resolution continuum images obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the surface density of star formation in z ∼ 2 galaxies and study the different physical properties between galaxies within and above the star-formation main sequence of galaxies. Methods. We use ALMA images at 870 µm with 0.2 arcsec resolution in order to resolve star formation in a sample of eight star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field. This sample is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, HUDF. We derive dust and gas masses for the galaxies, compute their depletion times and gas fractions, and study the relative distributions of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) light. Results. ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of dusty star formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located above the SFR-M main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales typical of starbursts of ∼150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the FIR and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) estimated using UV-optical-near-infrared data alone underestimate the total SFR. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of star formation prior to passivization. Being Herschel-selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether these “starbursts hidden in the main sequence” also exist below 1011 M. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus triggers star formation."
"Target recognition system of dynamic scene based on artificial intelligence vision  2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.Using the current recognition system to recognize dynamic scene cannot effectively speed up the target recognition. When target recognition increases, the accuracy of target recognition is relatively low. In order to solve this problem, a target recognition system of dynamic scene based on DSP was designed. Combined with the idea of DSP system design, the design process and composition of target recognition system was expounded. The recognition algorithm based on spatial-temporal condition information was used to realize the designed recognition system. By introducing the visual attention mechanism, the spatial-temporal domain model based on visual significance was built. The pixel neighborhood weighted condition information was used as classification features to enhance the linear separability for target and background and improve the recognition accuracy of dynamic scene moving target. Finally, combined with image block modeling strategy, the efficient and real-time recognition of moving target in dynamic scene was realized. Experimental results show that the proposed target recognition system can effectively improve the accuracy of target recognition."
"Utilization of natural fibers in the fabrication of lightweight concretes  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Natural fibers; rice straw and coconut coir fiber, which are found in large quantity in Thailand, were utilized as main materials for low cost lightweight concretes. The total fiber content was varied in the range 30-50 vol%. Fine (untreated) coconut coir fiber of <1 mm in size was used in this study. Coarse rice straw (5-20 mm) and fine rice straw (1-5 mm) were treated with 15% sodium hydroxide and found effective for removing hemicellulose, lignin and fatty acids. This improved the surface roughness and hydrophobicity of the cellulose fibers hence the adhesion between the fiber surface and cement phase was greatly improved. Lightweight concrete containing 20% fine rice straw and 10% fine coconut coir fiber in the composition showed high compressive strength valu of 138.73±19.13 kg/cm2 with bulk density reduced by 30% compared to 100% cement."
"Rational design and synthesis of SiC/TiC@SiOx/TiO2 porous core-shell nanostructure with excellent Li-ion storage performance  The Royal Society of Chemistry.Rational design and synthesis of a new silicon carbide/titanium carbide@silicon oxide/titanium dioxide (SiC/TiC@SiOx/TiO2) porous core-shell nanostructured material could significantly enhance the specific capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability of electrodes. The results demonstrate that the specific capacities are 387, 300, 252, 210, 174 and 151 mA h g−1 at 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. The newly designed electrode still exhibits a larger specific capacity of 217 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after the 1000th cycle."
"The efficiency of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide adsorption using impregnated granular activated carbon and zeolite  Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018.In this work, adsorbents granular activated carbon (GAC), granular activated carbon with acetylene (CVD/GAC) and zeolite A were applied for carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) gas removal. The adsorbents were characterised by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Polyethyleneimine (PEI) in ethanol with initial concentration of 0.2 g l-1 and 1 mol dm-3 lithium nitrate (LiNO3) were prepared to improve the adsorption capacity. In the impregnation process, various adsorbents, i.e., GAC, CVD/GAC and zeolite A were placed in a vial containing 0.2 g l-1 of PEI and 1 mol dm-3 of LiNO3 solution, at different ratios of adsorbent and various solutions of 30%W/W. The adsorbents (GAC, PEI/CVD/GAC:PEI/GAC, LiNO3/CVD/GAC:LiNO3/ GAC, zeolite 5A, PEI/zeolite 5A and LiNO3/zeolite 5A) were tested by using the synthetic biogas (45% CO2, 10% N2, 45% CH4 and 105 mg dm-3 of H2S). The performance of CO2 and H2S adsorption results have shown that PEI/CVD/GAC is the best adsorbent for low concentration of H2S and LiNO3/5A is the best adsorbent for CO2 adsorption. The purity of the outlet methane was 96.6%, 97.3%, 98.1%, 81.53%, 80.6% and 93.6% for zeolite 5A, LiNO3/5A, PEI/5A, GAC, LiNO3/CVD/GAC and PEI/CVD/GAC, respectively. The selectivity in the H2S/CH4 ratio of GAC is higher than zeolite 5A. The adsorption selectivity of the CO2/ CH4 ratio of LiNO3/5A is higher than GAC."
"Anion identification using silsesquioxane cages  The Royal Society of Chemistry.Anthracene-conjugated octameric silsesquioxane (AnSQ) cages, prepared via Heck coupling between octavinylsilsesquioxane (OVS) and 9-bromoanthracene, thermodynamically display intramolecular excimer emissions. More importantly, these hosts are sensitive to each anionic guest, thereby resulting in change of anthracene excimer formation, displaying the solvent-dependent fluorescence and allowing us to distinguish up to four ions such as F−, OH−, CN− and PO4 3− by fluorescence spectroscopy. Depending on the solvent polarity, for example, both F− and CN− quenched the fluorescence emission intensity in THF, but only F− could enhance the fluorescence in all other solvents. The presence of PO4 3− results in fluorescence enhancements in high polarity solvents such as DMSO, DMF, and acetone, while OH− induces enhancements only in low polarity solvents (e.g. DCM and toluene). A picture of the anion recognizing ability of AnSQ was obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) with NMR and FTIR confirming the presence of host-guest interactions. Computational modeling studies demonstrate the conformation of host-guest complexation and also the change of excimer formation. Detection of F−, CN− and OH− by AnSQ hosts in THF is noticeable with the naked eye, as indicated by strong color changes arising from charge transfer complex formation upon anion addition."

"Language, reality, emptiness, laughs  2018 Pennsylvania State University.All right reserved.Laughter, especially in connection with philosophy, reality, or language, is not much discussed in the vast literature of Buddhism. In the few places where it is discussed, however, there are two strands. On the one hand, laughter is frowned upon when it is seen as an attraction that leads one astray from the path. This is evident in the Tālaputa Sutta, where the Buddha says that actors and comedians would find it very difficult to enter the Path. It is also found in the Vinaya, where the emphasis is on the proper behavior of monks. The Buddha often rebukes monks who laugh out loud in the villages where householders can see them. The other strand views laughter more positively. This strand is found more in the Mahāyāna literature, where the Buddha laughs when he realizes emptiness, that nothing is substantial. The attitude of Buddhism to-ward laughter is conditional. Laughter and playfulness have a soteriological role to play as a skillful means, and Buddhism is not always serious."
"Porcine bile powder supplementation of a high fat broiler diet in relation to growth performance and nutrient digestion  2019 CSIRO.The aim of the study was to examine the effect of pig bile powder supplementation on the digestibility of nutrients, fat digestion and growth performance of starter broilers fed on a high fat diet. A total of 1110, day-old, male broiler chicks (Arbor Acres) were randomly allocated into six treatment groups with five replicates per treatment. The chicks were fed on a corn-soybean meal basal diet with a starter formulation until Day 14, followed by a grower formulation until Day 21. In group 1 (T1), the basal diet contained 30 g/kg crude palm oil whereas the diet used in group 2 (T2) had 60 g/kg crude palm oil. Chicks in group 3 (T3) were fed on T2 diet supplemented with 5.0 g/kg soy lecithin as the positive control. Chicks in groups 4-6 (T4-T6) received diets used in T2, supplemented with 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 g/kg lyophilised pig bile powder, respectively. On Days 4, 7, 14 and 21, chicks were killed, portal blood was collected and analysed for fatty acids, pancreas collected for measurement of pancreatic lipase activity, bile and jejunal contents for bile acid determination and ileal content for determining digestibility of fat and protein. The results showed (1) there was no difference in bodyweight and feed intake among T2-T6, (2) pancreatic lipase activity of chicks in T4 and T5 was highest in all periods. Total bile acid concentrations in the gall bladder and jejunum in T4 was lower than those in T2 in all periods, and Days 4 and 7, respectively, (3) digestibility of protein and fat in T3 and T4 was higher in all the period than that of T2, T5 and T6, (4) increased fat content in the diet did not cause a significant increase in any fatty acids in the portal plasma when compared T1 and T2. In conclusion, 2.5 g/kg porcine bile powder supplemented in high fat diet increased pancreatic lipase activity and total bile acid concentrations in gall bladder, resulting in increased ileal digestibility of fat and protein."
"Characterization and quick screening methodology of novel alloys for biomedical applications using filtered cathodic vacuum arc deposited thin film  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Ti-based amorphous alloys containing no harmful elements are desired. However, many Ti-based amorphous alloys contain toxic elements such as Al, Ni, V and Be. The presence of toxic elements within amorphous alloys is a concern when they are intended for use as a biomaterial. This problem has steered many researchers toward the development of Ti-based amorphous alloys without toxic elements. Our novel amorphous alloys were developed based on this principle. A series of Ti44Zr10Pd10Cu6+xCo23-xTa7 (x = 0, 4, 8) amorphous alloys were developed for biomedical application. A series of protocol tests were performed to check for biocompatibility and potential use of the novel alloys in humans. First, alloy ingots were alloyed by induction melting and then cast into copper molds. The cast rod was then used as the plasma cathode in a filtered cathodic vacuum arc deposition chamber to coat the 25-nm amorphous alloy thin film on the cover glass slides. These coated cover glass slides were then examined for biocompatibility. Cell proliferation and cell differentiation were investigated using Methylthiazol Tetrazolium assay test and by alkaline phosphatase assay on osteoblast like cells (SaOS-2), respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was performed to evaluate the thin film surface characteristics. The thickness of thin film was analyzed using a Stylus profilometer. An adhesion scratch test was administered to evaluate the thin film adhesive strength and indirect hardness comparison. Electron Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry was performed to study the elemental composition. Lastly, a medical grade Ti-6Al-4V alloy was studied in parallel as a control material. Results indicated that all investigated Ti-based amorphous alloys were non-cytotoxic and were comparable to the Ti-6AL-4V. They also demonstrated an ability to support differentiation of osteoblast like cells. The adhesion and the hardness of the thin films on the substrates were superior to that of Ti-6Al-4V. The results suggested that the novel alloys in this study could be potentially utilized in biomedical applications."
"Systematic revision and phylogenetic reassessment of the centipede genera Rhysida Wood, 1862 and Alluropus Silvestri, 1912 (Chilopoda: Scolopendromorpha) in Southeast Asia, with further discussion of the subfamily Otostigminae  CSIRO.Phylogenetic relationships of two morphologically similar scolopendrid genera, Rhysida Wood, 1862, and Alluropus Silvestri, 1912, were investigated based on broad-scale taxonomic sampling from SE Asia, India and Australia. Morphological revision and molecular phylogenetics using three loci validate seven Rhysida species in SE Asia and Australia: R. lithobioides (Newport, 1845), R. longipes (Newport, 1845), R. immarginata (Porat, 1876), R. nuda (Newport, 1845), R. carinulata (Haase, 1887), R. singaporiensis Verhoeff, 1937 and R. polyacantha Koch, 1985. The nominal SE Asian species R. leviventer Attems, 1953 and R. marginata Attems, 1953 are placed in junior subjective synonymy with R. lithobioides and Alluropus calcaratus (Pocock, 1891), respectively. The monotypic genus Alluropus is redescribed, molecular phylogeny recovering it nesting together with Indo-Australian Rhysida. Taxonomic revision reassigned R. calcarata Pocock, 1891 to Alluropus based on its morphological and molecular similarity to the type, A. demangei Silvestri, 1912, the differences between putative species being sexual variation. Two morphologically distinct allopatric populations of A. calcaratus, comb. nov. (= A. demangei, syn. nov.) were found in the Indochina subregion. Phylogenetic relationships in Otostigminae remain unsettled because clades within several genera lack significant support, although Rhysida consistently falls into two clades that are not each other's closest relative."
"Skin manifestations in patients with adult-onset immunodeficiency due to anti-interferon-gamma autoantibody: A relationship with systemic infections  2018 Acta Dermato-Venereologica.Adult-onset immunodeficiency due to anti-interferon-γ autoantibody is an emerging acquired immunodeficiency with frequent skin manifestations. A retrospective chart review was conducted and identified 41 patients with the syndrome. Skin involvement was detected in 33 (80%) patients, 15 (45%) with infective skin diseases and 27 (82%) with reactive skin disorders. Reactive lesions were mostly neutrophilic dermatoses, e.g. Sweet syndrome. Of note, the presence of neutrophilic dermatoses was highly associated with infections of other sites. An adjusted odds ratio for the existence of infections in patients with neutrophilic dermatoses was 14.79 (95% CI: 5.13, 42.70; p < 0.001). Moreover, neutrophilic dermatoses were significantly correlated with opportunistic infections observed in those with defects in cell-mediated immunity including non-tu-berculous mycobacterium and disseminated fungal infection. The odds ratio for opportunistic infections in the presence of neutrophilic dermatoses was 12.35 (95% CI: 5.00, 30.55; p < 0.001). Thus, the presence of neutrophilic dermatoses in patients with the syndrome can signal opportunistic infections that warrant physician attention."
On Nearly Prime Submodules of Unitary Modules  2018 Nguyen Dang Hoa Nghiem et al.The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of nearly prime submodules as a generalization of prime submodules. We investigate some of their basic properties and point out the similarities between these submodules and the prime submodules. We also indicate some applications of nearly prime submodules. These applications show how nearly prime submodules control the structure of modules and they recover earlier relative theorems.
"Allocating responsibility for the damage from deceptive PR-materials disseminated by the media: A thought experiment  Blanquerna School of Communication and International Relations. All rights reserved.Media practitioners often rely on PR specialists as a source of information. Journalists use press releases, newsletters, press briefings, etc. as a foundation for editorial content. But what happens if the media passes along PR-materials to audiences that are not absolutely true, or even intentionally false, and the public is deceived by these false messages? Who bears the responsibility for harmful consequences? Who should be held accountable: A deceptive PR practitioner, the journalist who relies too heavily on this type of source, or the public? The paper utilises the methods of legal philosophy to approach these questions and to theoretically examine how responsibility is (or could be) allocated between the actors in the communication process. Using the methodology of a thought experiment —a hypothetical case in which a pharmaceutical company makes a false claim about its products and disseminates it via a press release— the authors come to the conclusion that the balance between freedom of speech and property rights requires an individual case-by-case approach, and that deceptive messages themselves are not a crime. To hold a company responsible in each case, there must be a specific victim who demands restitution and justice, and turns to the courts or judges to adjudicate the dispute."
"Acute effect of ivabradine on heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption in dogs with asymptomatic mitral valve degeneration  2018 Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science.Degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) is a common cardiac disease in geriatric dogs characterized by the degeneration of the mitral valve, leading to decreased cardiac output and activation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This disease results in an increased resting heart rate (HR) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). A recent publication demonstrated that dogs with asymptomatic DMVD had a significantly higher HR and systemic blood pressure (BP) than age-matched control dogs. This higher HR will eventually contribute to increased MVO2. This study aimed to determine the effects of a single oral dose of ivabradine on the HR, MVO2 as assessed by the rate-pressure product, and BP in dogs with asymptomatic DMVD. Seven beagles with naturally occurring DMVD were instrumented by the Holter recorder and an oscillometric device to measure electrocardiogram and BP for 24 and 12 h, respectively. Each dog was randomly subjected to receive either placebo or ivabradine (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg). The results revealed that oral administration of ivabradine significantly decreased the HR and rate-pressure product in a dose-dependent manner without adverse effects. The highest dose of 2.0 mg/kg significantly reduced systolic and mean BP. Therefore, the findings imply that a single oral ivabradine administration at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg is suitable for dogs with asymptomatic DMVD to reduce the HR and MVO2 without marked effects on BP. This may potentially make ivabradine promising for management of an elevated HR in DMVD dogs."
"Cytotoxic activity of the chemical constituents of Clerodendrum indicum and Clerodendrum villosum roots  2017 Shanghai Changhai HospitalObjective The roots of two Thai medicinal plants, Clerodendrum indicum and Clerodendrum villosum are found in traditional medicine practices. The aim of this research was to preliminarily study the cytotoxicity of extracts of their roots, and the parts that possessed cytotoxic activity were separated on a chromatograph to identify their active compounds. Methods The extracts of both plants were screened for cytotoxicity on the SW620 cell line and the compounds isolated from the active extracts were further evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against five human cancer cell lines, including SW620, ChaGo-K-1, HepG2, KATO-III and BT-474 using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results Dichloromethane extracts of C. indicum and C. villosum were active against the SW620 cell line. Triterpenoids were mostly obtained from the extracts of these plants (0.28% and 1.02%, respectively) and exhibited varying degrees of cytotoxicity and specificity against the tested cell lines. Two triterpenoids, oleanolic acid 3-acetate and betulinic acid, displayed moderate to strong cytotoxicity toward all cancer cell lines, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 1.66–20.49 µmol/L, whereas 3β-hydroxy-D:B-friedo-olean-5-ene and taraxerol were cytotoxic to only the SW620 cell line (IC50 = 23.39 and 2.09 µmol/L, respectively). Triterpenoid, lupeol, showed potent cytotoxicity on both SW620 (IC50 = 1.99 µmol/L) and KATO-III cell lines (IC50 = 1.95 µmol/L), while a flavonoid, pectolinarigenin, displayed moderate cytotoxicity against these cells (IC50 = 13.05 and 24.31 µmol/L, respectively). Although the widely distributed steroid, stigmasterol, was effective against the SW620 cell line (IC50 = 2.79 µmol/L) and β-sitosterol was also active against SW620 (IC50 = 11.26 µmol/L), BT-474 (IC50 = 14.11 µmol/L) and HepG2 cancer cells (IC50 = 20.47 µmol/L), none of the characteristic 24β-ethylsteroids of either Clerodendrum species were shown to be cytotoxic. Conclusion This study is the first report on the presence of cytotoxic triterpenoids from the roots of these medicinal plants, which have been used in herbal formulas as an antipyretic. Our findings support further in-depth study of this pharmacological activity as an anticancer agent."
"Using factor analysis techniques to identify SME information systems' functionality requirements  2018 Common Ground Research Networks.Information systems are key to the success of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for developing business. SMEs have difficulty using enterprise class information systems due to different working structures and limited resources. The software development life cycle (SDLC) and traditional requirement engineering may not be appropriate for SMEs. Requirement engineering refers to collecting data from users, translating it, and executing programming. SMEs have limited digital literacy. In most cases, entrepreneurs fail to identify requirements clearly and developers fail to understand respondents in terms of business details. The matter becomes more difficult working with users' requirements. The wrong identification of user requirement generates system failure. This article's research objective is reforming the method of elicitation in the requirement engineering process from face-to-face interviews to electronic surveys. After collecting user requirements, factor analysis techniques are used in place of the requirement gathering and business analysis procedure in SDLC; presently, these two processes are based on system analyst consideration. 221 SME companies in Thailand responded to the electronic survey. The research results highlight four factors with the highest influence on SME information systems' functionality requirements: 1) easy access and data interconnection, which has the highest influence; 2) easy operation with security, which has the second highest; 3) knowledge network for self-study and variety, which is third; and 4) connection with a customizable prototype, which is fourth."
"Relative telomere length and oxidative DNA damage in hypertrophic ligamentum flavum of lumbar spinal stenosis  2018 Dechsupa et al.Background. Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common cause of low back pain with degenerative spinal change in older adults. Telomeres are repetitive nucleoproteinDNA sequences of TTAGGG at the ends of chromosomes. Oxidative stress originates from an imbalance in pro-oxidant and antioxidant homeostasis that results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The purpose of this study was to investigate relative telomere length (RTL) and oxidative DNA damage in ligamentum flavum (LF) tissue from LSS patients. Methods. Forty-eight patients with LSS participated in this study. Genomic DNA from non-hypertrophic and hypertrophic LF tissue were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for relative telomere length (RTL). 8-hydroxy 2'-deoxygaunosine (8-OHdG) levels were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We cultivated LF fibroblast cells from patients in different ages (61, 66, and 77 years). After each cultivation cycle, we examined RTL and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) expression. Results. The hypertrophic LF had significantly lower RTL than non-hypertrophic LF (P = 0:04). The levels of 8-OHdG were significantly higher in hypertrophic LF compared to non-hypertrophic LF (P=0:02). With advancing cell culture passage, the number of cells in each passage was significantly lower in hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells than non-hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells. When evaluated with SA-β-gal staining, all senescent LF fibroblast cells were observed at earlier passages in hypertrophic LF compared with non-hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells. Discussion. Our results showed that patients with LSS displayed an accelerated RTL shortening and high oxidative stress in hypertrophic LF. These findings implied that telomere shortening and oxidative stress may play roles in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic LF in lumbar spinal stenosis."
"Smoking and accelerated lung function decline in HIV-positive individuals: A secondary analysis of the START pulmonary substudy  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Background:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and disability globally. Both cigarette smoking and HIV have been identified as independent risk factors for COPD. We used data from the strategic timing of antiretroviral treatment (START) Pulmonary Substudy to quantify the impact of smoking on rate of lung function decline in HIV.Methods:We included START Pulmonary Substudy participants who contributed at least 2 good quality spirometry measures during the study. Slope of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was estimated using a repeated-measures model adjusted for the treatment group (immediate vs deferred treatment arm of START), age, sex, race, baseline COPD, and region.Results:Of 1026 START Pulmonary Substudy participants, 915 (89%) were included in this analysis. Median follow-up time was 3.9 years. Smokers and nonsmokers were similar in baseline age (median 36 years), but smokers were more likely to be white, male, and from Europe/Israel/Australia. Smokers had faster average FEV1 decline compared with nonsmokers [-38.3 mL/yr vs -25.1 mL/yr; difference of -13.2 mL/yr (95% confidence interval: -23.6 to -2.7); P = 0.013], were more likely to meet criteria for rapid FEV1 decline [7.2%-11.7% more likely (P = 0.09-P = 0.002), depending on the definition of rapid decline], and had borderline, but not statistically significant, higher incident COPD during follow-up (9.7% vs 5.8%, P = 0.06).Conclusions:Compared to nonsmokers, HIV-positive smokers experience faster decline in lung function. These results underscore the need for a better understanding of how to best support smoking cessation among HIV-positive populations."
"Multiscale adaptive regularisation Savitzky– Golay method for speckle noise reduction in ultrasound images  The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.Speckle noise is one of the major artefacts in ultrasound images. The denoising faces the trade-off between noise suppression and structural preservation. In this study, multiscale adaptive regularisation Savitzky–Golay (MARSG) method, the new filter for removing speckle noise, is proposed. The proposed method combines the benefit of the multiscale analysis and the outstanding noise removing capability of Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter. The Laplacian pyramid is employed to separate an image into the noise, texture and object layers. Adaptive regularisation Savitzky–Golay (ARSG) filter is developed as the denoising filter in the noise and the texture layers. The denoising of the ARSG filter is adaptively adjusted in order to preserve the edges of objects in the image. The experiments on the synthetic and ultrasound images demonstrated that MARSG method offered better balance between noise removal and structural preservation than non-linear multiscale wavelet diffusion, featureenhanced speckle reduction and regularised SG filter."
"Determinants ofehealth literacy level among royal thai army personnel: A case study  2018, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved.The use of internet based information and communication technology to obtain health information (eHealth) has gained increasing attention in public health. People need to know how to access accurate, appropriate health information (eHealth literacy). The objective of this study was to determine the eHealth literacy level among Royal Thai Army (RTA) personnel and identify factors associated with the level of eHealth literacy. Baseline data from this study will be used for both developing and evaluating a program to promote eHealth literacy among RTA personnel. In 2016, RTA personnel in Bangkok who admitted to accessing the internet were asked to fill out a questionnaire to test their eHealth literacy. The results were quantified into an eHealth literacy scale. Three hundred subjects were included in this study. The mean age of study subjects was 34 (range: 19-59) years. Of the study subjects, 73.7% had previously accessed health information on the internet. The average score was 31.6 (range: 20-40) points, with a score of ≥26 points being determined to have adequate eHealth literacy. On multivariate analysis using logistic regression, eHealth literacy level was significantly influenced by perceived usefulness of the internet in making decisions about health (p = 0.017) and perceived importance of being able to access eHealth resources (p = 0.006). Our study suggested the best method to improve eHealth literacy among RTA personnel is to educate the population on the perceived usefulness of the internet and the importance of being able to access eHealth resources. Further studies are needed to determine the quality of eHealth information accessed and determine which RTA personnel would benefit the most from a program to improve eHealth literacy."
"Preparation of solid lipid nanoparticles containing mangosteen pericarp extract  2018 The Authors.Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) containing mangosteen pericarp extract (MPE) to achieve enhanced photoprotection and to provide an alternative to synthetic sunscreens in the market. Materials and Methods: The MPE was prepared using the maceration method, and evaluated for sun protection factor (SPF) value using an ultraviolet (UV)-Vis spectrophotometer. SLNs were prepared through ultrasonication method. Blank-SLNs were formulated using stearic acid (SA) or palmitic acid (PA) as solid lipids at a concentration of 3%. Tween® 80 or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was employed as a surfactant with a concentration ranging from 1 to 2%. The obtained blank-SLNs were investigated for their physical characteristics, (i.e., morphology, particle size, polydispersity index [PDI], and zeta potential values). The blank-SLNs with suitable physical characteristics were selected to encapsulate MPE and evaluated for the physical characteristics. Results: The MPE was a brownish viscous substance with an SPF value that ranged from 3.09±0.005 to 27.20±0.05 at a concentration ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 mg/ml. Based on the physical characteristics, the blank-SLNs employing PA or SA with 1% of PVA were selected. The MPE-SLNs were spherical, with a particle size that ranged from 443.51±6.50 to 533.52±16.15 nm; PDI ranged from 0.35±0.008 to 0.459±0.02, and zeta potential value ranged from 18.32±1.37 to −19.03±0.64. The entrapment efficiencies of MPE-PA-SLNs and MPE-SA-SLNs were 83.24±1.37% and 84.17±0.411%, respectively. Conclusion: The results indicated the promising potential of MPE as a UVB photoprotector. The MPE-SLNs were also successfully formulated, but, further study is needed to confirm the potential of MPE-SLNs to be used as a sunscreen, and their stability during storage."
"Alkaline stability of polyaniline synthesized using pulsed inductively coupled plasma device  2018 Trans Tech Publications.The stability of polyaniline synthesized using pulsed inductively coupled plasma device was studied in alkaline media. Polyaniline was exposed to potassium hydroxide at 25 C and 90 C for various time intervals up to 4 months. An increase in %mass loss, the decreases in the absorbance intensities of polyaniline characteristic bands in FT-IR and UV-Visible spectra and the reduction of the conductivity with increasing exposure time to alkaline solution and/or temperature indicated the increases in the conversion of polyaniline into its base form and the degradation of its structure. The results also suggested that the temperature was the main factor affecting its conductivity in alkaline stability since exposing at 25 C and 90 C caused the conductivity to decrease from 4.53×10-8 S.cm-1 to 1.74×10-8 S.cm-1, 8.15×10-9 S.cm-1 in 4 months, respectively. Therefore, this polyaniline synthesized via this system may be suitable for the applications at room temperature where alkaline stability is needed."
"Insecticidal activity of thai botanical extracts against development stages of german cockroach, blattella germanica (L.) (orthoptera: Blattellidae)  2018, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved.The German cockroach, Blattella germanica, is considered an important medical and economic pest in Thailand. The insecticidal activities of hexane, acetone and ethanol extracts derived from six Thai botanicals, namely, Piper retrofractum Vahl, Stemona tuberosa Lour, Derris elliptica (Wall.) Benth., Rhinacanthus nasutus (L.), Butea superba Roxb., and Foeniculum vulgare Mill. were used to evaluate their toxicities against a variety of developmental stages of B. germanica including nymphs, adults and gravid females. All botanical extracts showed high insecticidal activity (up to 100%) after a 24-hour exposure at 200 µg/insect, using 2 µl/insect 1% Tween-20 in distilled water as negative control. Extracts from P. retrofractum gave the highest mortality to all B. germanica developmental stages, with the acetone extract showing maximal insecticidal activity against both gravid (LD50 = 39 µg/ insect; LD90 = 52 µg/insect) and adult (LD50 = 53 µg/insect; LD90 = 104 µg/insect) stages after a 6-hour exposure. Isolation and purification of the main components of P. retrofractum acetone extract by column chromatography led to a fraction with highest insecticidal activity against nymphs. Subsequent purification by thin layer chromatography led to identification of piperine as the major bioactive compound. This is the first report of insecticidal activity from P. retrofractum extracts against B. germanica and holds promise as a potential biopesticide."

"The nanoporous carbon derived from melamine based polybenzoxazine and NaCl templating  2018 Trans Tech Publications, SwitzerlandNanoporous carbon was successfully prepared by using polybenzoxazine synthesized from bisphenol-A, melamine and formaldehyde as a precursor. The varied HCl amounts have been added into the pre-polymer solution as a catalyst for the ring-opening polymerization. The reaction was traced by FTIR and DSC. In addition, the degradation behavior was studied by TGA and the textural properties were characterized by SEM and surface area analysis (AS1-MP). The nanoporous carbon obtained showed the highest char yield up to 48%. The interconnected structure from the SEM images of the nanoporous carbon exhibited significantly high surface area of 632 m2/g, high total pore volume up to 1.78 cm2/g, small average pore diameter and narrow pore size distribution detected by AS1-MP. After the activation process, the surface area has been drastically improved leading to the increasing of surface area and total pore volume up to 1119 m2/g and 1.93 cm2/g, respectively. In order to further study on the enhancement of surface area, NaCl, a water soluble compound, has been used as a template. As a result, the surface area has been improved up to 1516 m2/g."
"The influence of building envelop materials on its life cycle performance: A case study of educational building in Thailand  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The analysis of life cycle energy (LCE) and life cycle carbon (LCC) of building were performed in this study in order to identify the solutions for reducing energy-related carbon emission throughout building life time. The influence factors associated with building envelop materials (wall, insulation, window, window-to-wall ratio) were evaluated. The result showed that operation phase contributed a vast majority (>90%) of LCE and LCC. Only 4% emissions saving could be achieved if autoclaved aerated concrete block, cellulose insulation and triple glazing were implemented with WWR of 0.17. The finding suggested that reducing carbon emission should not only be prioritized through use of high energy efficient materials/technologies but should also integrate energy saving measures since energy demand in tropical country is quite high for cooling building. In addition, increasing a possibility and feasibility for supplying renewable energy should be further investigated importunately."
"Low prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in pediatric skin and soft tissue infections in thailand  2018, SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All rights reserved.Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTIs) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are an important public health problem among children. We aimed to determine the prevalence of MRSA among children with SSTIs who presented to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in order to inform empiric treatment. We conducted a prospective study among children aged <15 years who presented during June 2015 to March 2016 with a SSTI. In each subject a swab for culture and sensitivity was obtained from the skin lesion, normal skin, and the anterior nares. A total of 102 patients were included in this study. Forty-seven percent of subjects had a history of atopic dermatitis (AD). Sixty-one patients (60%) had a positive culture. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism isolated (85%), followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (6%), Streptococcus pyogenes (5%), Escherichia coli (2%) and Pseudomonas spp (2%). MRSA was found in 3 patients from the skin lesions, 1 patient from normal skin, and 4 patients from the anterior nares. All patients with MRSA infection had moderately severe AD. All MRSA isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gen-tamicin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, moxifloxacin and doxycycline. We found a lower prevalence of MRSA among study subjects. Effective antibiotics included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fusidic acid. Among children aged ≥ 12 years, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are also treatment options. However our findings suggest empiric coverage for MRSA among our study population with SSTIs is not necessary for initial treatment."
"Printed PZT thick films implemented for functionalized gas sensors  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Attractive for MEMS, PZT thick films are often microstructured on Si supporting platforms to span the gap between ceramics and thin film technologies. Printing process might lead to lower cost than ceramic process to open routes for MEMS applications. In this paper processing by screen-printing of Au/PZT/Au thick-films supported on alumina or completely released from the substrate are described. Investigations of the film microstructures nevertheless show lower densification than those of bulk ceramics. Prior to selective coating deposition, routes to improve the reduction of the film's porosity are proposed."
"Metakaolin based geopolymer from Thailand as an adsorbent for adsorption of multi- and mono-cations from aqueous solution  2018 Trans Tech Publications.Waste management and water quality are two main problems nowadays. Geopolymer material has efficiency for adsorbing the ions from wastewater. In this research, the metakaolin based geopolymer was studied and used as an adsorbent to remove heavy metal ions. Moreover, the factors which affect adsorption process of heavy metals on geopolymer materials were investigated. The kaolin as used in this research was from Thailand. The metakaolin geopolymer was synthesized by mixed raw materials with an alkaline solution. The metakaolin geopolymer was washed and sieved through 100 mesh. The produced metakaolin geopolymer powder was used as an adsorbent. The XRD results showed a highly amorphous structure in obtained metakaolin geopolymer. Moreover, the BET surface area of metakaolin and geopolymer particles were 9.83 m2/g and 20.36 m2/g, respectively. The parameters of adsorbent amount, initial pH, time of shaking, temperature and initial metal ions concentration on the removal potential of geopolymer were studied. In addition, the multi-and mono-cations solution were demonstrated to compare the efficiency of each heavy metal ions. The results showed that the amount of Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+ ions adsorbed onto metakaolin geopolymer increased with an increasing contact time, pH, temperature and amount of geopolymer. It is concluded that Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+ ions in aqueous solution are efficiently removed by metakaolin geopolymer which could be applied as a low cost and good alternative for wastewater treatment."
"Serum tryptophan, tryptophan catabolites and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in subgroups of youngsters with autism spectrum disorders  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Background: There is evidence that changes in neuro-immune responses coupled with dysfunctions in serotonin metabolism underpin the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Objective: This study aimed to delineate whether ASD subgroups or characteristics show aberrations in tryptophan and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) metabolism. Methods: 65 individuals with ASD (diagnosed according to ICD criteria) and 30 healthy control patients were included. Measured were serum levels of tryptophan, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KA), quinolinic acid (QA), BDNF and PRO-BDNF and total blood 5-HT and 5-OH-tryptophan (5-HTP). Results: Elevated BDNF levels and lower tryptophan and KA levels were characteristics of both childhood autism and intellectual disability disorder, whilst elevated tryptophan and lower 5-HT synthesis were hallmarks of Asperger syndrome. A pathological MRI was associated with elevated tryptophan and lowered KA. Abnormal EEG results and dysmorphology were both associated with an elevated BDNF/ PRO-BDNF ratio. Any brain pathology and gastro-intestinal symptoms were accompanied by lowered KA. Conclusions: Increased BDNF production and changes in the metabolism of tryptophan are associated with many ASD characteristics, showing particularly strong associations with childhood autism and Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. Peripheral BDNF and tryptophan metabolism appear to take part in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders and their phenotypes."
"Serum interleukin levels and insulin resistance in major depressive disorder  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Background & Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with inflammatory processes, including increased cytokine levels, even in individuals who are otherwise physically healthy, while some MDD patients may show insulin resistance (IR). Method: However, correlations between cytokines and IR parameters have not been studied extensively in MDD. In the present study, we measured IL-1β, IL-4, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, insulin and glucose in 63 MDD patients and 27 healthy controls. The associations between cytokine levels and IR were examined. Results: The results revealed a significant increase (p<0.05) in serum levels of IL-1β, IL-4, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, insulin, insulin/glucose ratio, and insulin resistance (HOMA2IR) in MDD patients as compared with controls. There was a significant correlation between HOMA2IR with both IFN-γ (ρ=0.289, p<0.05) and TGF-β1 (ρ=0.364, p<0.05). Conclusion: The present study further confirms that MDD is accompanied by activation of the immune system with significant elevations in the levels of four cytokines. These results indicate stimulation of the immune system and increased IR and modulation of IR by increased cytokine levels in MDD. These findings show that immune activation and associated IR are a new drug target in depression."
"Naturally acquired IgG antibodies to thrombospondin-related anonymous protein of plasmodium vivax (PvTRAP) in Thailand predominantly elicit immunological cross-reactivity  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.background Thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) is a prime candidate for a malaria vaccine. Antibodies to Plasmodium vivax TRAP (PvTRAP) occur upon natural infection while specific antigenic domains remain to be addressed. methods The PvTRAP sequences were determined from 73 P. vivax isolates from Tak and Ubon Ratchathani provinces collected in 2013. The recombinant proteins representing four variants each for domain II (A domain) and domain IV (thrombospondin repeat region) of PvTRAP circulating in these areas were used as antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against 246 serum samples from P. vivax-infected patients in both provinces collected during 2013 and 2014. results The prevalence of total IgG antibodies to at least one variant antigen of domain II and domain IV was 63.8% and 71.5%, respectively. Differential IgG antibody responses to these variant antigens of each domain were observed. Total IgG antibody responses to the variant antigens of each domain upon pairwise comparisons were highly correlated, suggesting immunological cross-reactivity in the majority of serum samples. A smaller proportion of serum samples contained non-crossreactive antibodies to variants of each domain; particularly domain II in which amino acid differences significantly influenced antibody recognition. Previous malaria exposure positively affected antibody responses to domain IV. Positive seroconversion and rising antibody titres occurred within a few weeks after resolution of infections. conclusions Both domains II and IV are targets of naturally acquired IgG antibodies. Despite sequence variation in these domains, most antibody responses were cross-reactive. A cross-sectional evaluation of antibodies to PvTRAP during acute infection could underestimate the seroprevalence."
"Epos2012 has better specificity compared to idsa2012 for diagnosing acute bacterial rhinosinusitis*,#  2018, International Rhinologic Society. All rights reserved.Background: Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a subtype of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). To prevent excessive antibiotic prescribing, clinical criteria for diagnosing ABRS are presented in two major international guidelines from European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS2012) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA2012). This study aims to assess accuracy of these criteria. Methodology: Patients with ARS were recruited. Clinical features were collected including discolored nasal discharge, facial pain, fever, double sickening, symptoms persisting longer than 10 days, and elevated serum C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ERS). Using middle meatal bacterial culture as a reference, accuracy of EPOS2012 and IDSA2012 criteria were analyzed. Results: Eighty-eight patients (age 43.2±14.5 years, 67% female) with ARS were recruited. Using the two criteria for diagnosing ABRS, EPOS2012 and IDSA2012 have sensitivity of 50% (95%CI: 38%-62%) versus 69% (95%CI: 57%-79%), specificity of 63% (95%CI: 43%-79%) versus 46% (95%CI: 28%-65%), and accuracy of 53% versus 63%, respectively. Conclusion: Both EPOS2012 and IDSA2012 had modest accuracy. EPOS2012 had less sensitivity but a better specificity compared to IDSA2012. This suggests that IDSA2012 diagnostic criteria may contribute to inappropriate use of antibiotics due to poorer specificity."

"Probabilistic regular grammar inference algorithm using incremental technique  Proceedings of 2018 the 8th International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering, WCSE 2018. All rights reserved.Grammatical inference has been studied for a long time where grammar is illustrated by a collection of re-writing rules, together with their probabilities. We are interested in regular language model which can be recognized by a finite state machine. The most popular technique is an Alergia algorithm. The objective is to construct a probabilistic finite state machine using only positive examples together with their probabilities (or frequency). In this work, we introduce a probabilistic grammatical inference algorithm in order to construct a prefix tree. The algorithm starts by considering the shortest positive example. Two types of regular grammar rules (productions) are introduced. Our experimental results show that the probabilities obtained from our probabilistic finite state machine can be more accurate than the one obtained from the previous algorithm. We hope that our algorithm will be an alternative way for constructing a probabilistic finite state machine."
"Memory T cell subsets in healthy gingiva and periodontitis tissues  2018 The Authors. Journal of Periodontology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: In the gingival sulcus, effective and balanced innate and adaptive immune responses against subgingival plaque microbiome are crucial to maintain immune homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the memory T cell subsets in healthy gingiva and periodontitis tissues. Methods: Anatomical localization of T cells (CD3+,CD4+, and CD8+) in healthy gingiva and periodontitis tissues were examined immunohistochemically. Subsets of memory T cells from isolated gingival cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD69, anti-CD103, anti-CD45RA, anti-CCR7, anti-CD28, and anti-CD95). Intracellular cytokine staining of interleukin (IL)-17 and interferon (IFN)-γ expression on memory T cells in periodontitis tissues was also investigated. Results: We found that healthy gingiva contains two memory T cell populations; a CD69− recirculating population and a CD69+ gingiva-resident memory T cell population. CD4+ T cells with transitional memory (TTM) phenotype (CD45RA−CCR7−CD28+CD95+) constitute the major subset within these two populations. A significant increase in the proportion of CD4+CD69+CD103− memory T cells was observed in periodontitis tissues compared with healthy gingiva. CD4+ memory T cells from periodontitis tissues produced either IL-17 or IFN-γ whereas CD8+ memory T cells produced only IFN-γ. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that recirculating and gingiva-resident memory T cells could represent an important part of the immune surveillance network in the connective tissue, maintaining periodontal homeostasis. Imbalance of subgingival bacterial communities could damage gingival barrier allowing bacterial antigens to get access to the deeper connective tissue where they activate memory T cells leading to deleterious inflammation; a hallmark of periodontitis."
"Extracting data invariants from PROMELA  Proceedings of 2018 the 8th International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering, WCSE 2018. All rights reserved.Data Invariants are the essential conditions that hold during the execution of program. In software verification, the data invariants should be assessed to ensure the correctness of the system behavior. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to indicate the data invariants in a given source code. In this paper, we aim to extract relevant data invariants automatically from the Promela source code. The Promela code is typically used as the software modelling language in model checking tool, called SPIN model checker. We exploit the program slicing technique to minimize the Promela source code and track all of the relevant active bound variables to recognize the data invariants in term of their possible and valid bounded values. The data invariants are written in propositions and their temporal logic formula (LTL formula). The resulting data invariants are checked using model checking tool."
"Secure hotspot with multi-factor authentication through NFC on smartphones  Proceedings of 2018 the 8th International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering, WCSE 2018. All rights reserved.Many today enterprises attempt to protect their wireless networks from security threats. Another layer of security is typically added to verify users when connecting to a wireless network. One of the well-known enterprise authentication methods includes WPA2 Enterprise with 802.1X standard, which uses the EAP framework to enable user authentication. Deploying WPA2-Enterprise requires a RADIUS server for handling the task of authenticating access. However, credentials management for all users is a hassle for administrators. Strong authentication processes also require more and more certain actions from users. To enhance security for both users and wireless networks, this research thus presents an approach of Wi-Fi hotspot authentication by adopting MFA technique in addition to NFC utilization for credential information exchange. The implementation is developed on NFC-enabled Android smartphones through network model based on WPA2-802.1X authentication with EAP-TLS. The benefits of the proposed method would be the ease of Wi-Fi configuration and simplicity of internet access as reported in the experimental result."
"Travel planning application: Combining linear programming and shortest route problem to optimize travelers' satisfactions  2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka. All rights reserved.Travelers around the world use mobile applicationsto plan their holiday trips. However, none of the existingapplications in the market is capable of optimizing satisfactionof a trip which travelers have different genders and variousinterests. This research proposes theoretical foundation formobile application developers to create an applicationpersonalized for travel couples. A good trip for a couple is madeof shared interests of both travelers. However, places andactivities that are interesting for women may not satisfy men'sinterests and vice versa. Variables such as time, budget, stamina,satisfaction of a male traveler, and satisfaction of female travelerfactors to the constraints of the trip. By using the variables asmentioned above, the model is developed with the objective tomaximize satisfaction of the trip while balancing the interests ofboth genders. The shortest path models, both forward andbackward routes, are combined with linear programming to setthe constraints. The results of the simulation are applicable. Thecouple gets a solution for travel spots to visit, transportationroute, money and time used for transportation, money and timeused for visiting places, as well as the total satisfaction of bothtravelers."
"Solving a multi-manned assembly line balancing problem in a Pareto sense Copyright  2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.This paper presents a novel algorithm which modifies the coincident algorithm (COIN), namely the adaptive extended coincident algorithm (AE-COIN), to solve a multi-manned assembly line balancing problem (MALBP). The multiple objectives are optimised in a hierarchical manner comprising of the following objectives: 1) minimise the number of workers; 2) minimise the number of stations; 3) balance workloads between stations and maximise work relatedness. The objectives in the third hierarchy are optimised in a Pareto sense since they are conflicting in nature. The performances of AE-COIN are compared against well-known algorithms, i.e., BBO, NSGA II and DPSO. The experimental results show that AE-COIN outperforms its contestants in both solution quality and diversity."
"Nanoparticles and Organic Matter: Process and Impact  2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The world today is still relying mainly on fossil-based resources for the production of most economically important chemicals. To reduce the dependency on fossil resources, the development of a biorefinery using plant and microbial biomass has been given attention globally. In general, the plant and microbial biomasses are complex biomaterials that are complicated for utilization as biochemical producers. The use of biorefineries to produce biochemicals from biomass is a challenging task, specifically the development of a catalyst system that facilitates the conversion of complex materials into biomolecules. There are several kinds of catalysts and each has certain catalytic properties, with the combination of process coordination. Various physical, chemical, and biological methods are available for obtaining biomolecules; among them nanomaterials have gained much attention in biomass processing because they have shown excellent performance in a wide range of biomass conversion reactions. The fractionation of biomass using nanomaterials involves partial oxidation of biomass in the presence of charged molecules, resulting in the production of various macro- and micromolecules. Nanomaterial-mediated treatments are generally carried out in the presence of water at high temperature. The advantages of nanomaterials are that they are in a solid phase and can easily be recycled. The development of highly efficient nanomaterials is crucial for the cost-effectiveness of the production process."
"Multiple novel mutations in Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene during implementation of artemisinin combination therapy in Thailand Copyright  2018 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.Mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter gene of Plasmodium falciparum (Pfcrt) are associated with drug susceptibility status of chloroquine and other antimalarials that interfere with heme detoxification process including artemisinin. We aim to investigate whether an increase in duration of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in Thailand could affect mutations in Pfcrt. The complete coding sequences of Pfcrt and dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr), and size polymorphisms of the merozoite surface proteins-1 and 2 (Pfmsp-1 and Pfmsp-2) of 189 P. falciparum isolates collected during 1991 and 2016 were analyzed. In total, 12 novel amino acid substitutions and 13 novel PfCRT haplotypes were identified. The most prevalent haplotype belonged to the Dd2 sequence and no wild type was found. A significant positive correlation between the frequency of Pfcrt mutants and the year of sample collection was observed during nationwide ACT implementation (r = 0.780; P = 0.038). The number of haplotypes and nucleotide diversity of isolates collected during 3-day ACT (2009-2016) significantly outnumbered those collected before this treatment regimen. Positive Darwinian selection occurred in the transmembrane domains only among isolates collected during 3-day ACT but not among those collected before this period. No remarkable change was observed in the molecular indices for other loci analyzed when similar comparisons were performed. An increase in the duration of artesunate in combination therapy in Thailand could exert selective pressure on the Pfcrt locus, resulting in emergence of novel variants. The impact of these novel haplotypes on antimalarial susceptibilities requires further study."
"High risk breast lesions identified on MrI-guided vacuum-assisted needle biopsy: Outcome of surgical excision and imaging follow-up  2018 The Authors. Published by the British Institute of RadiologyObjective: To determine whether breast MRI-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (MRI-VAB) high-risk lesion histology influences surgical or long-term imaging follow-up outcomes. Methods: Patients with imaging-concordant high-risk findings on 9-gauge breast MRI-VAB between January 2007 and July 2012 who had surgical histopathology or 2 year imaging follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. results: 90 patients with 99 lesions were included. Lesions were atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) (n = 21), lobular neoplasia [n = 36; atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) (n = 22), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (n = 6), and ALH plus LCIS (n = 8)], and other high-risk lesion (n = 42; papillary lesions, radial scar, flat epithelial atypia, atypia unspecified). Of 53 excised lesions, 6 (11%) were upgraded to invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 4 of 21 (19%) ADH lesions were upgraded to DCIS. 2 of 36 (6%) lobular neoplasia lesions, both combined ALH and LCIS, were upgraded to DCIS, and invasive lobular carcinoma, respectively. The remaining 46 lesions were managed conservatively with imaging follow-up: 17 (37%) had mammography only, while 29 (63%) had mammography and MRI follow-up. There was no evidence of breast cancer development at the site of MRI-VAB in the cases with only imaging follow-up. conclusion: We conclude that the upgrade rate for high-risk lesions at MRI-VAB at surgical excision is low. Surgical excision is warranted for ADH and combined ALH-LCIS lesions. For other lesions, a multidisciplinary approach to decide on personalized management may be appropriate. advances in knowledge: Surgical excision is warranted for ADH lesions and combined ALH-LCIS lesions identified at breast MRI-VAB. A multidisciplinary approach to patient management of other high-risk lesions may be appropriate."
"Chapter 32 - Placental Correlates of Unanticipated Fetal Death  2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Examination of the placenta is a critical component in evaluating the etiology of intrauterine demise. This is particularly true as pregnancy progresses, as the cause of demise beyond the first trimester is less likely to be due to intrinsic fetal disease and more likely due to ""errors of the intrauterine environment""; that is, as a result of causes extrinsic to the fetus. As a general principle, the longer intrauterine stressors that ultimately result in demise are present, the more likely that placental ""footprints"" of those stressors will (1) accrue and (2) be detectable by gross or microscopic examination. This chapter lists segregated specific mechanisms of demise based on the timing of evolution from onset to demise. Of relevance are the following concepts, the literature for which remains in evolution. These concepts pertain largely to subacute and chronic intrauterine pathologies, although superimposed acute manifestations of preexisting disorders can add to the overall burden of fetal stress and concomitant risk for untoward fetal/neonatal outcome. (1) As a general rule, the more advanced or extensive a pathologic process, the greater the potential risk for untoward fetal/neonatal outcome. (2) Threshold criteria are accruing for identifying the severity/extent of specific placental lesions that herald an increased risk of untoward outcome. (3) The coexistence of separate pathologic processes, each of which can have fetal/neonatal implications, compounds their cumulative effects in at least an additive, if not multiplicative manner. (4) The same processes that lead to unexpected fetal demise can also result in neonatal morbidity and mortality."
"Transmission dynamics among participants initiating antiretroviral therapy upon diagnosis of early acute HIV-1 infection in Thailand  2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.Objective: To assess transmission characteristics in a predominantly MSM cohort initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) immediately following diagnosis of acute HIV-1infection (AHI). Methods: A longitudinal study (2009-2017) was performed in participants with AHI (n 439) attending a single clinic in Bangkok. Plasma samples obtained prior to ART were used to obtain HIV-1 pol sequences and combined with clinical and epidemiologic data to assess transmission dynamics (cluster formation and size) using phylogenetic analysis. Clusters were estimated using maximum likelihood, genetic distance of 1.5% and visual inspection. The potential transmitter(s) in a cluster was determined using time to viral suppression and interview data. Results: The cohort was predominantly MSM(93%) and infected with HIV-1 CRF01-AE (87%). Medians (ranges) for age and viral load prior to ART were 26 (18-70) years and 5.9 (2.5-8.2) log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. Median time from history of HIV-1 exposure to diagnosis was 19 (3-61) days. Viral suppression was observed in 388 of 412 (94%) participants at amedian timeof 12weeks followingART.Twenty-six clusters withmedian cluster size of 2 (2-5) representing 62 of 439 (14%) participants were observed. Younger age was associated with cluster formation: median 28 versus 30 years for unique infections (P 0.01). A potential transmitter was identified in 11 of 26 (42%) clusters. Conclusion: Despite high rates of viral suppression following diagnosis and treatment of AHI within a cohort of young Thai MSM, HIV-1 transmission continued, reflecting the need to expand awareness and treatment access to the entire MSM population."
"Distinct microbial community performing dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in a high C/NO3 – reactor  2018, Japanese Society of Microbial Ecology. All rights reserved.A dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) microbial community was developed under a high organic carbon to nitrate (C/NO3 –) ratio in an anoxic semi-continuous sequencing batch reactor (SBR) fed with glucose as the source of carbon and NO3 – as the electron acceptor. Activated sludge collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant with good denitrification efficiency was used as the inoculum to start the system. The aim of this study was to examine the microbial populations in a high C/NO3 – ecosystem for potential DNRA microorganisms, which are the microbial group with the ability to reduce NO3 – to ammonium (NH4 +). A low C/NO3 – reactor was operated in parallel for direct comparisons of the microbial communities that developed under different C/NO3 – values. The occurrence of DNRA in the high C/NO3 – SBR was evidenced by stable isotope-labeled nitrate and nitrite (15NO3 – and15NO2 –), which proved the formation of NH4 + from dissimilatory NO3 –/NO2 – reduction, in which both nitrogen oxides induced DNRA activity in a similar manner. An analysis of sludge samples with Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the predominant microorganisms in the high C/NO3 – SBR were related to Sulfurospirillum and the family Lachnospiraceae, which were barely present in the low C/NO3 – system. A comparison of the populations and activities of the two reactors indicated that these major taxa play important roles as DNRA microorganisms under the high C/NO3 – condition. Additionally, a beta-diversity analysis revealed distinct microbial compositions between the low and high C/NO3 – SBRs, which reflected the activities observed in the two systems."
"Biocontrol of Orchid-pathogenic Mold, Phytophthora palmivora, by antifungal proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa RS1  2018 The Author(s).Black rot disease in orchids is caused by the water mold Phytophthora palmivora. To gain better biocontrol performance, several factors affecting growth and antifungal substance production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa RS1 were verified. These factors include type and pH of media, temperature, and time for antifungal production. The results showed that the best conditions for P. aeruginosa RS1 to produce the active compounds was cultivating the bacteria in Luria-Bertani medium at pH 7.0 for 21 h at 37 °C. The culture filtrate was subjected to stepwise ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitated proteins from the 40% to 80% fraction showed antifungal activity and were further purified by column chromatography. The eluted proteins from fractions 9-10 and 33-34 had the highest antifungal activity at about 75% and 82% inhibition, respectively. SDS-PAGE revealed that the 9-10 fraction contained mixed proteins with molecular weights of 54 kDa, 32 kDa, and 20 kDa, while the 33-34 fraction contained mixed proteins with molecular weights of 40 kDa, 32 kDa, and 29 kDa. Each band of the proteins was analyzed by LC/MS to identify the protein. The result from Spectrum Modeler indicated that these proteins were closed similarly to three groups of the following proteins; catalase, chitin binding protein, and protease. Morphological study under scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the partially purified proteins from P. aeruginosa RS1 caused abnormal growth and hypha elongation in P. palmivora. The bacteria and/or these proteins may be useful for controlling black rot disease caused by P. palmivora in orchid orchards."
"A health behavior screening tool for non-specific neck pain in office workers: A 1-year prospective cohort study  Article author(s).Objective: One effective strategy for management of musculoskeletal disorders is self-management based on the biopsychosocial model. Self-management requires patients to have adequate health literacy, defined as the individual's ability to seek, understand, and utilize health information. Recently, the neck painspecific health behavior for office workers (NHBOW) questionnaire was developed based upon a conceptual framework of health literacy. The content in the NHBOW relates to the work and exercise behaviors of office workers. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive validity of the NHBOW. Methods: At baseline, 342 healthy participants filled out a series of questionnaires, including the NHBOW. The incidence of neck pain was prospectively recorded every month over a 12- month period. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were calculated. Results: There were 103 (30.7%) incidents of non-specific neck pain among 335 office workers during the 12-month period, and seven participants were lost to follow-up. For the NHBOW, a cut-off score of less than or equal to 8 points (lower scores indicate poorer health behavior) had a sensitivity of 57.3% and a specificity of 96.6%. The positive and negative predictive values were 88.1% and 83.6%, respectively. The AUC was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.706 to 0.832). Conclusion: The NHBOW was an acceptable screening tool for predicting nonspecific neck pain in office workers during the 1-year follow-up period, and can be used in occupational and primary care settings."
"Safety and tolerability of inguinal lymph node biopsy in individuals with acute HIV infection in Thailand  2018 The Author(s).Introduction: Latent HIV reservoirs are rapidly established in lymphoid tissues during acute HIV infection (AHI). Sampling these tissues provides important information about HIV pathogenesis. This period is associated with viral replication and immune activation that may affect procedure-related adverse events (AEs). We examined the safety and tolerability of inguinal lymph node (LN) biopsy in research participants with AHI in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: Between 2013 and 2016, 67 AHI participants in the RV254/ SEARCH010 study underwent at least one optional inguinal LN biopsy during AHI at the baseline visit and/or after antiretroviral therapy (median 48 weeks after antiretroviral therapy). Biopsy-related AEs were graded according to NIH Division of AIDS guidelines. Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals to evaluate associations of demographic and HIV characteristics, procedure timing, and repetition with AE incidence. Results: Of the 67 participants, 97% were male with a median age of 26. Among 78 LN biopsies (39 at baseline and 39 at follow-up), 10 (12.8%) AEs were reported: 6 (7.7%) grade 1 and 4 (5.1%) grade 2. The AEs were biopsy-site discomfort (n = 8, 10.2%) and hematoma (n = 2, 2.6%). No factors were significantly associated with AE incidence. All biopsy-related AEs were transient and self-limited. Conclusions: Inguinal LN biopsies were safe and well tolerated in mostly Thai men with AHI. As LN biopsies become an integral part of HIV research, this study provides information to participants, researchers, and institutional review boards that these samples can be safely obtained."
"A Pilot Study on Geothermal Heat Pump (GHP) use for cooling operations, and on GHP site selection in tropical regions based on a case study in Thailand  2018 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.In order to reduce electricity consumption, the vertical loop geothermal heat pump (GHP) system coupled with a normal air conditioner was installed in an experimental room in the Parot Racha Building, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand for a comparative, long-term measurement program. The decrease in electricity consumption was approximately 30%. On the basis of the data derived from our measurements, the underground temperature seemed to be consistent and lower than the average outside air temperature, over two years. The underground system consisted mainly of two 50-m-long drilling wells and pipes with a total length of 170 m. The well performance was not examined, but both soil and groundwater aquifer (Bangkok aquifer) at 25 to 50 m. could be utilized for the cooling operation. Moreover, the major controlling factors of electricity consumption were found to be the outside air temperatures and the underground water circulation temperatures. In addition, we considered the geology, underground temperature, and aquifer of Bangkok concluding that almost all Bangkok areas are suitable for GHP installation, except for those where the subsurface temperature is too high compared with the outside air temperature."
"The social base of new authoritarianism in Southeast Asia: Class struggle and the imperial mode of living  2018 SEAS - Society for South-East Asian Studies.This research note addresses the question of the social base of new authoritarianism and sketches out new directions for future research. In Europe and the United States, this question has led to highly controversial debates between two camps. One side argues for a class analysis and sees a revolt of the disenfranchised and poor behind the electoral success of the right-wing populists. The other side draws on the concept of the Imperial Model of Living and focuses on a cross-class alliance in the North, defending their unsustainable consumption pattern, which rests on the exploitation of resources, sinks, and cheap labor from the South. It will be argued that a view from Southeast Asia - especially data from Thailand and the Philippines - has the potential to challenge some assumptions of this debate and add important insights. Here, a rising middle-class has been in the focus of the debate on democratization in the 1980s/1990s. Starting with the Asia Crisis in 1997/1998, the rise of the new authoritarianism has also been linked to middle-class mobilization. Finally, due to the proximity to China and historical links, the re-orientation of middle-classes towards China provides insights into the micro processes behind the shift in the global economic system."
"National human rights institutions, extraterritorial obligations, and hydropower in Southeast Asia: Implications of the region's authoritarian turn  2018 SEAS - Society for South-East Asian Studies.This article examines the role of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) and transnational civil society in pursing Extraterritorial Obligation (ETO) cases in Southeast Asia as a means to investigate human rights threatened by cross-border investment projects. Two large hydropower dams under construction in Laos submitted to NHRIs from Thailand and Malaysia, namely the Xayaburi Dam and Don Sahong Dam, are detailed as case studies. The article argues that the emergence of ETOs in Southeast Asia, and its future potential, is dependent upon the collaborative relationship between the NHRIs and transnational civil society networks. Whilst NHRIs are in positions of political authority to investigate cases, civil society also enable cases through networking, research, and public advocacy. Further institutionalization of ETOs is significant to emerging regional and global agendas on business and human rights, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights that both the Thai and Malaysian governments have expressed commitment to. However, in Thailand and its neighboring countries where investments are located there has been an authoritarian turn. Reflecting this, there are weakening mandates of NHRIs and reduced civil and political freedoms upon which civil society depends that challenges the ability to investigate and pursue cases."
"Recovery from nonspecific neck pain in office workers  2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: Neck pain has an episodic course with varying time for recovery and identification of individuals likely to recover is important. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was twofold: 1a) to explore the duration of recovery from nonspecific neck pain, and 1b) to investigate the relation between recovery duration and age, and 2) to evaluate whether the NHBOW can predict duration of recovery from non-specific neck pain. METHODS: One hundred and three from 342 office workers reported non-specific neck pain, with information collected on pain intensity and disability every month for 12 months. The time to recovery was measured from the onset of neck pain to full recovery. The 103 office workers were divided into two groups using the NHBOW score. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to describe the median time to recovery. The survival curves of the two NHBOW groups were compared using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The median time to recovery from neck pain was 2 months. The duration of recovery was not significantly related with age of participants. There was no significant difference in time to recovery from neck pain between the NHBOW low-score group and the high-score group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the NHBOW was unable to predict duration of recovery from nonspecific neck pain in office workers."
"Cellular responses of periodontal ligament stem cells to a novel synthesized form of calcium hydrogen phosphate with a hydroxyapatite-like surface for periodontal tissue engineering  2018, Nihon University, School of Dentistry. All rights reserved.Calcium hydrogen phosphate with a hydroxyapatite-like surface (CHP-HA) is a novel synthesized compound designed to overcome the limitations of bioactive ceramics. It was originally applied as nano-sized HA strips covering core plates to enhance the degree of interfacial attachment. The objective of the present study was to examine the cellular attachment, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) on a CHP-HA substrate in comparison with conventional nanohydroxyapatite (NanoHA). The PDLSCs were cultivated with either CHP-HA or NanoHA for cellular attachment, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation assay. Osteogenic differentiation was examined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence after confirmation by Alizarin red staining. We found that between 14 and 21 days, CHP-HA exhibited a well-organized matrix distribution, a high degree of cell proliferation, and a high level of Alizarin red staining in comparison to NanoHA. Expression of all the osteogenic markers examined was increased significantly relative to NanoHA at 14 days, but no significant differences in some osteogenic genes were found at 21 days. Immunofluorescence revealed stronger staining in the CHP-HA group. In conclusion, PDLSCs cultivated with this novel CHP-HA show enhanced cellular responses. We propose that CHP-HA may be a promising alternative biomaterial for periodontal tissue engineering."
"Analytical sheet pile displacement for deep braced excavation in soft Bangkok Clay  2018 ISRM International Symposium 2000, IS 2000. All rights reserved.This paper presents the analytical displacement of the sheet pile braced excavation system by means of the FEM technique based on case studies of deep excavation in Bangkok city with full geotechnical instrumentation. The research sites consists of 4 projects where the field measurement was recorded corresponds to the construction techniques and sequences. These four case studies had different boundary conditions with the excavation depth varied between 8-11 m. while the bracing spans and construction techniques were different. The back-figured values for soil stiffness in terms of Young's modulus are calculated as Eu/Su = 150, 250 and 1000 for soft Bangkok clay, medium clay and stiff silty clay, respectively. The results have later been confirmed with the first self-boring pressuremeter tests in Bangkok subsoils."
"The iron silk road and the iron fist: Making sense of the military coup d'état in Thailand  2018 SEAS - Society for South-East Asian Studies.In May of 2014, the military of Thailand staged a coup and overthrew the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The political divisions in Thailand, which culminated in the coup, as well as the course of events leading to the coup, are difficult to explain via Thai domestic policy and the power relations between Thailand's military, corporate, and civil entities. The divisions can be more clearly revealed when interpreted in the context of the large-scale Chinese project ""One Belt, One Road"". This ambitious infrastructure project represents an important step in the rise of China to the position of the world's biggest economic power and - drawing on world-systems theory - to the center of a new long accumulation cycle of the global economy. Against this backdrop, it will be argued that developments in Thailand can be interpreted historically as an example of the upheavals in the periphery of China, the new center. The establishment of an autocratic system is, however, not directly attributable to the influence of China, but results from the interplay of internal factors in Thailand."
"Typhoidal salmonella trends in Thailand Copyright  2018 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and HygieneTyphoid and paratyphoid fever remain endemic diseases in Thailand with wide variation in subnational incidence trends. We examined these trends alongside contextual factors to study potential interactions and guide control strategies for this disease. Culture-confirmed typhoid and paratyphoid fever data from 2003 to 2014 were collected from the Ministry of Public Health website. Contextual factor data were collected from various sources including World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring Program, United Education Statistical World Bank database, World Bank, Development Research group, and global child mortality estimates published in the Lancet. Typhoid fever exhibited a declining trend with peak incidence reported in 2003 at 8.6 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Incidence dropped to three cases per 100,000 persons in 2014. The trend in paratyphoid fever remained stable with the peak incidence of 0.77 cases per 100,000 persons observed in 2009. Subnational variations of typhoid were seen throughout the study period with the highest incidence observed in the northwestern region of Thailand. Increases in female literacy, and access to improved water and sanitation were observed with decreases in poverty head count ratio and diarrheal mortality rate per 1,000 live births. Case fatality remained consistently low at 0.4% or less in all years with reported deaths. At the national level, typhoid fever incidence has shown a notable decline; however, incidence appears to have plateaued since 2007 with access to improved water supply and sanitation above 80%. Eliminating this disease will require strong disease prevention measures in conjunction with effective treatment interventions."
"Modified finite integration method using chebyshev polynomial for solving linear differential equations  2018 European Society of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering.We propose a modified finite integration method (FIM) by using the Chebyshev polynomial, to construct the first order integral matrix for solving linear differential equations in one and two dimensions. The grid points for the computation are generated by the zeros of the Chebyshev polynomial of a certain degree. We implement our method with several examples arose from real-world applications. In comparison with the finite difference method and the traditional FIMs (trapezoidal and Simpson’s rules), numerical computations show that our modified FIM using Chebyshev nodes require the less computational cost to achieve significant improvement in accuracy."
"The relationship between diabetes-related complications and obstructive sleep apnea in type 2 diabetes Copyright  2018 Nantaporn Siwasaranond et al.This study explored the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the presence of any diabetes-related complications in type 2 diabetes and whether this was mediated by hypertension. Secondly, the relationship between OSA severity and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was investigated. A total of 131 patients participated. OSA was diagnosed using a home monitor, and severity was measured by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI). OSA was found in 75.6% of the participants, 40.5% with moderate-to-severe degree. Any diabetes-related complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, or coronary artery disease) were present in 55.5%, and 70.2% of the participants had hypertension. Mediation analysis indicated that, compared to those with mild or no OSA, those with moderate-to-severe OSA were 3.05 times more likely to have any diabetesrelated complications and that this relationship was mediated by the presence of hypertension. After adjusting for confounders, ODI (B = -0.036, p = 0 041), but not AHI, was significantly associated with lower eGFR. In conclusion, moderate-to-severe OSA was related to the presence of any diabetes-related complications in type 2 diabetes, and the relationship was mediated by hypertension. The severity of intermittent hypoxia was associated with lower eGFR. Whether OSA treatment will delay or reduce diabetes-related complications should be investigated."

"An Efficient One-Step Synthesis of Dihydroquinoline and Its Application as a Fluorescence Sensor for Selective Detection of Copper (II)  2018 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.An efficient one-step synthetic pathway to dihydroquinoline (DHQ) and benzodihydroquinoline (BDHQ) derivatives involving 1,2-Michael addition reaction between amino phenol/naphthol and two molecules of methyl propiolate followed by intramolecular cyclization and aromatization using cuprous iodide as a catalyst was successfully developed. The synthesized DHQ derivatives displayed highly selective fluorescence quenching in the presence of copper(II) with a very low detection limit (LOD for DHQ is 0.20 μM). Moreover, the mechanisms of both formation of the corresponding DHQ and the fluorescence quenching by copper(II) are proposed along with the evidence of X-ray diffraction data."
"Drug metabolite as a novel tool for measuring antimalarial drug adherence  2018 Irfanul Chakim.Malaria has been a major public health problem worldwide. The burden of malaria has been reduced by the adoption of Artemisinin-Combination Therapy (ACT) followed by primaquine dosage in malaria-endemic countries. However, evidences of non-adherence behavior lead to the discovery of antimalarial drug adherence to ensure a successful and satisfactory treatment of ACT, since it is the only available antimalarial drugs against asexual form of the parasite. Unstandardized questionnaires and limited effective alternative approaches have been the major obstacles to measure adherence. With rapid development of pharmacokinetic research, public health researchers can adopt the approach to measure adherence. Notwithstanding, the current structured questionnaire has explained in detail that the measurement and classification of adherence have produced satisfactory results. However, it is subject to social desirability bias. Therefore, in this review, we offer a new strategy combining structured questionnaire and drug metabolite as a novel consensus which eliminates biases. A new classification of adherence and graphical representation of practical strategy and other important factors are provided in this review. Thus, it initiates further works to conduct an intervention program to increase adherence level. Additionally, adherence behavior prevents the development of drug resistance and its spread, increases satisfactory cure rate and inhibits transmission by eliminating gametocyte inside host’s body."
"Dengue epidemics prediction: A survey of the state-of-the-art based on data science processes  2013 IEEE.Dengue infection is a mosquitoborne disease caused by dengue viruses, which are carried by several species of mosquito of the genus Aedes, principally Ae. aegypti. Dengue outbreaks are endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, mainly in urban and sub-urban areas. The outbreak is one of the top 10 diseases causing the most deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, dengue infection has increased 30-fold globally over the past five decades. About 50-100 million new infections occur annually in more than 80 countries. Many researchers are working on measures to prevent and control the spread. One avenue of research is collaboration between computer science and the epidemiology researchers in developing methods of predicting potential outbreaks of dengue infection. An important research objective is to develop models that enable, or enhance, forecasting of outbreaks of dengue, giving medical professionals the opportunity to develop plans for handling the outbreak, well in advance. Researchers have been gathering and analyzing data to better identify the relational factors driving the spread of the disease, as well as the development of a variety of methods of predictive modeling using statistical and mathematical analysis and machine learning. In this substantial review of the literature on the state of the art of research over the past decades, we identified six main issues to be explored and analyzed: 1) the available data sources; 2) data preparation techniques; 3) data representations; 4) forecasting models and methods; 5) dengue forecasting models evaluation approaches; and 6) future challenges and possibilities in forecasting modeling of dengue outbreaks. Our comprehensive exploration of the issues provides a valuable information foundation for new researchers in this important area of public health research and epidemiology."
"Sensitivity Enhancement of Benzene Sensor Using Ethyl Cellulose-Coated Surface-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes  2018 Thanattha Chobsilp et al.A hybrid sensor based on the integration of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with ethyl cellulose (EC) was fabricated for sensitivity enhancement of benzene detection. To functionalize the surface of MWCNTs, MWCNTs were treated with hydrochloric acid for 60 min (A60-MWCNTs), while other MWCNTs were treated with oxygen plasma for 30, 60, 90, and 120 min (P30-MWCNTs, P60-MWCNTs, P90-MWCNTs, and P120-MWCNTs, resp.). Pristine MWCNTs, A-MWCNTs, and P-MWCNTs were dispersed in 1,2-dichloroethane, then dropped onto a printed circuit board consisting of Cu/Au electrodes used as the sensor platform. Next, EC was separately spin coated on the pristine MWCNTs, A-MWCNTs, and P-MWCNTs (EC/MWCNTs, EC/A-MWCNTs, and EC/P-MWCNTs, resp.). All sensors responded to benzene vapor at room temperature by increasing their electrical resistance which was sensitive to benzene vapor. The EC/P90-MWCNTs enabled an approximately 11-fold improvement in benzene detection compared to EC/MWCNTs. The sensitivity of all sensors would be attributed to the swelling of EC, resulting in the loosening of the MWCNT network after benzene vapor exposure. The differences of the sensing responses of the EC/MWCNTs, EC/A-MWCNTs, and EC/P-MWCNTs would be ascribed to the differences in crystallinity and functionalization of MWCNT sidewalls, suggesting that acid and oxygen plasma treatments of MWCNTs would be promising techniques for the improvement of benzene detection."
"Generalization of slightly compressible modules  2018 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.In this paper, we give a generalization of slightly compressible modules. We introduce the notion of M-slightly compressible modules, i.e. a right R module N is called M-slightly compressible if for every nonzero submodule A of N there exists a nonzero R-homomorphism s from M to N such that s(M) ↪ A. Many examples of M-slightly compressible modules are provided. Some results on M-slightly compressible modules are obtained, which are interesting and important."
"Fabrication and stabilization of poly(acrylonitrile-co-methyl acrylate) nanofibers  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.In present study, poly (acrylonitrile-co-methyl acrylate) nanofibers were fabricated via electrospinning method and stabilized at elevated temperature in air. Electrospinning processing parameters i.e. solution concentration, solution flow rate and applied voltage were optimized. Fiber morphology and polydispersity index of fiber size was assessed from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Selected nanofiber was then used to study effect of stabilization time and stabilization temperature on fiber morphology, change in chemical structure and aromatization index (AI) using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. SEM images showed drastic morphological change of stabilized fibers compared to the as spun precursor. AI value increased as stabilization time and temperature increased and reaching maximum value of 98%. This indicated high cyclization of the aromatic ring in fiber structure. Current finding is critical for carbonization process and preparation of carbon nanofibers from PAN copolymer in the future."
"Mechanochemical assisted modification of parawood microcrystalline cellulose using silane coupling agent and their composites properties  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Surface treated parawood microcrystalline cellulose (PW-MCC) performed under mechanochemical reaction using planetary ball milling at ambient temperature was used as a reinforcing material in polypropylene composites. Initially, PW-MCC was prepared by acid hydrolysis of parawood sawdust pulp. After that, PW-MCC was treated with vinyltrimethoxysilane at milling speed 400 rpm for 60 min. The surface composition from XPS indicated the existence of silicon atom on silane-treated PW-MCC. The thermal stability of PW-MCC was also improved and SEM micrograph revealed rough surface after modification reaction. The untreated PW-MCC and treated PW-MCC were applied to prepare polypropylene composites at 5-30 wt% loading content without a compatibilizer. The results demonstrated that silane-treated PW-MCC/PP composites enhanced tensile strength, thermal stability and water resistance of the composites."
"Analysis of indentation on layered elastic medium with surface energy effects  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.This paper presents the analysis of an axisymmetric frictionless rigid punch on a layered elastic medium with the consideration of surface energy effects by adopting Gurtin-Murdoch continuum theory of surface elasticity. The indentation problem is formulated as a mixed-boundary value problem with the displacement boundary condition being imposed at the contact area. The unknown contact pressure under the indenter is then determined by employing a discretization technique with use of the displacement Green's functions. The required Green's functions are expressed in the form of the Hankel integral transform. The accuracy of the proposed solution scheme is verified by comparing with existing solutions. Selected numerical results on displacement and stress profiles in a layered elastic half-space are presented to demonstrate the influence of various parameters on elastic fields. It is found that the layered medium becomes stiffer and shows size-dependent behavior due to the presence of surface stresses."
"Investigation of a simultaneous silicon-modified pack aluminizing method on pure nickel using quartz and RHA  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.This research aims to study the simultaneous silicon-modified pack aluminizing method using silica (SiO2) from Rice Husk Ash (RHA) which contains 99.45% SiO2 in comparison with commercial SiO2 in the form of quartz. Samples can thus be categorized into two groups: quartz-doped and RHA-doped. Simultaneous silicon-modified pack aluminizing of pure nickel was performed at 1000°C for 4 hours under an argon atmosphere. The pack used in this research was prepared from aluminum (Al), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2, i.e. quartz and RHA) powder at ratios of 29:2:60:9 by weight, respectively. Post aluminized samples were characterized by glancing incident-angle X-ray diffractometer (GIXD). Quantitative analysis of the layer was performed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the resulting microstructure. It was found that simultaneous silicon-modified pack aluminizing can be successfully performed by doping RHA and quartz into the pack. The aluminized layer consists of Ni2Al3 and NiAl3 with a small amount of silicon. RHA was found to be more effective than quartz as a silicon source providing a higher amount of silicon in the aluminized layer. Moreover, using RHA successfully forms a silicon-rich interdiffusion layer beneath the typical aluminized layer."
"Rock wool and printed circuit boards (PCBs) as partial fine aggregate replacements in cement mortar  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The utilization of industrial wastes such as, fly ash, silica fumes, and slag in construction materials, has been receiving increased attention due to its environmental friendliness and reduction of natural resources consumptions. This study investigates and compares the utilization of spent rock wool from industrial insulation and printed circuit boards (PCBs) (the non-metallic part) as a partial replacement for conventional fine aggregates in cement mortar. Each of the waste materials was used as a partial fine aggregate ranging from 0% to 20%, by weight. The cement mortar samples were cured at 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. To investigate the properties of the cement mortars with different amounts of industrial wastes, the density, compressive strength, transverse strength and thermal conductivity of each mortar variation were measured. The results indicate that the compressive and transverse strengths of the cement mortars decreased as more industrial wastes was present in the mixtures. However, the fine aggregate substitutes improved thermal resistance, as indicated by the decreasing thermal conductivity values of the cement mortars. Thus, the use of these two industrial wastes in cement mortar could be a viable option for non-structural and non-load bearing construction applications because these substitutes have the ability to produce mortar with suitable mechanical and insulating properties."
"Effect of rice husk ash silica as cement replacement for making construction mortar  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Rice husk ash (RHA) is used as a replacement to cement to produce mortar. The effect of 5, 10, and 15wt% addition to the density and compressive strength of mortar is investigated. It was found that with the increasing addition of RHA causes the decrease of compressive strength and density of mortars. Compressive strength of mortar drops with addition of RHA, from a value of 42 MPa of no RHA addition, to 24 MPa of 15wt% RHA addition. Reduction in compression strength may be due to the decrease in density, which arises from porous RHA. This is more dominant in mortar made from addition of RHA without prior acid treated. Carbon residue and impurity in RHA further reduce the compressive strength of mortar. In addition, this research validate the use of a more environmentally friendly citric acid for partially removal of oxide impurities prior to burning the rice husk."
"Blue zircon from Ratanakiri, Cambodia  2018 The Gemmological Association of Great Britain.Zircon from Ratanakiri Province, north-eastern Cambodia, is well known in the gem trade for its vivid blue colour that results from heat treatment. The untreated brown material turns blue under reducing conditions at ~900-1,000°C. Ratanakiri zircon is characterised by remarkably low contents of trace elements. In particular, the actinides have low concentrations (e.g. approximately 120 ppm U and 95 ppm Th). Together with the very young age of the zircon ( < 1 million years [Ma]), this results in an extremely low self-irradiation dose, which in turn is in agreement with its non-radiation-damaged, nearly perfectly crystalline state. The heat treatment, therefore, does not result in detectable changes in the zircon's structural state. The cause of the blue colour, presumably related to a valence change upon heating in the reducing environment, is still under debate. The absorption of the treated Ratanakiri zircon is decidedly different from that of blue U4+-doped and blue V4+-doped synthetic ZrSiO4. Absorption spectra show a strongly pleochroic band at 18,200- 13,000 cm-1 (corresponding to ~550-770 nm wavelength) that is clearly responsible for the treated blue colour; however, its assignment remains unresolved."
"Effects of current pulsation on magnetic properties and giant magnetoimpedance of electrodeposited NiFe coatings on Cu wires  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.This work presents a systematic study of the effects of current pulsation on soft magnetic properties and giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) of nickel-iron (NiFe) coatings electrodeposited on copper wires. The specimens were prepared by the electrodeposition technique with controlled bath compositions and varied applied current waveforms. The microstructural and chemical investigations indicate that current pulsation with 50% duty cycle and 50 Hz frequency provides significantly smoother coating surface of uniform nodules, with comparable Fe content but different phase composition, as compared to the direct current condition. The vibrating sample magnetometer evidently shows that the deposits prepared with a pulsed current exhibit relatively small coercivity, below 4 Oe. Using the four-point probe technique, the MI ratio of the pulse deposits is found to reach a significantly high value above 2,000% with decent sensitivity. The benefits of current pulsation in improving the characteristics of NiFe deposits, and correspondingly the alloys’ soft magnetic properties and MI effects are demonstrated."
"Reliability and minimal detectable change of sit-to-stand kinematics and kinetics in typical children  University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw.Purpose: The study aimed to determine the within- and between-session reliabilities as well as the minimal detectable change (MDC) of generally used temporal, kinematic, and kinetic parameters during the sit-to-stand (STS) task in typical children. Methods: The study involved 10 typical children (9.8 ± 1.6 years old). Motion analysis and force plate systems were used to collect markers for 3-dimensional trajectories in space and measure the ground reaction force. The total of 29 reflective markers were placed on each participant's body in accordance with the Helen Hays marker set model by 1 rater on 2 separate days within the span of 1 week. Each subject was asked to perform an STS task 3 times from a height-adjustable chair. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and MDC for temporal, kinematic, and kinetic parameters were calculated within and between sessions. Results: The results indicated that the temporal parameters achieved excellent (ICC > 0.75), the kinematic parameters presented poor to excellent (0.232 < ICC < 0.997), and the kinetic parameters showed fair to excellent (0.635 < ICC < 0.977) reliabilities in both within- and between-session analyses. The SEM of most kinematic parameters was less than 2° both within and between sessions. In addition, the MDC values for between sessions ranged 1.25-12.64°. Conclusions: The findings support the reliability of using 3-dimensional motion analysis and force plate systems for measuring temporal, kinematic, and kinetic parameters for STS tasks in typical children."
"Vibration enhances pge2, il-6, and il-8 expression in compressed hpdl cells via cyclooxygenase pathway  2018 American Academy of Periodontology.Background: Although vibration combined with orthodontic force may accelerate orthodontic tooth movement, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the associated cellular responses. The goal of this study was to investigate whether mechanical vibration combined with compressive force regulates cyclooxygenase (COX)-2/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells via the COX pathway. Methods: The primary cultured hPDL cells were exposed to mechanical vibration, compressive force or a combination of both mechanical vibration and compressive force at 24, 48, and 72 hours. The COX-2, IL-6, IL-8, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegrin (OPG) mRNA expressions were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 protein expressions were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To demonstrate whether the expression of PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 was in the COX-dependent pathway, the hPDL cells were treated with indomethacin. To determine whether PGE2 stimulated the hPDL cells to express IL-6 and IL-8, exogenous PGE2 was added to the culture media. Results: The combination of mechanical vibration and compressive force synergistically upregulated RANKL/OPG, COX-2/PGE2, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA, and protein expression. The indomethacin significantly attenuated the increases of PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 expression in cells stimulated with compressive force or mechanical vibration combined with compressive force. In addition, exogenous PGE2 increased IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA and protein expressions in hPDL cells. Conclusion: Mechanical vibration may enhance alveolar bone resorption at the compression side during orthodontic tooth movement via a mechanism involving the cyclooxygenase pathway."
"Local structural changes in graphene oxide layers induced by silver nanoparticles  2018 the Owner Societies.Structural changes of graphene oxide (GO) in silver/graphene oxide (AGO) nanocomposites are investigated using tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS). Because of markedly high spatial resolution of the TERS technique, the measurements of molecular information at specific nano-scaled positions can be achieved by constructing line-profile TERS spectra straight from the center of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on GO layers. The results show evidences that AgNPs cause shortening of C-C bonds beneath AgNPs, flattening of GO layers, and critical bending on GO layers. Additionally, a connection of carbon atoms via a C-C network subsequently expands structural changes with a distance of 200-250 nm from the center of AgNPs, even though this distance is larger than the size of AgNPs. The proposed model of GO structural changes unveils new understanding about changes in properties from GO to AGO nanocomposites, which will contribute to a development of advanced nanostructures/nanocomposites in the near future."
"Preparation of chitin whisker and effect to crystallization of polylactide  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chitin whisker (CW) to the crystallization of polylactide (PLA) nanocomposite films. CW which obtained from acidolysis reaction was compounded with PLA pellets into nanocomposite films by cast film extrusion. The morphology and crystallinity of CW were observed by TEM and XRD, illustrated that the dimension of whisker was affected by hydrolysis time. Increasing of hydrolysis time, the length of whisker was more regular with narrower distribution. Moreover, the crystallinity of whisker was obviously increased after acid hydrolysis. The nanocomposite film showed rough surface compared to pure PLA film due to some agglomeration of nanoparticles. However, CW and PLA were well-mixed with no phase separation. The introduction of 0.1 phr of CW decrease cold-crystallization temperature (Tcc) from about 121°C to 118°C and also increase the degree of crystallinity around 10%. There was no difference of thermal transition temperature between pure PLA and nanocomposite films with the addition of CW more than 0.1 phr which inspected by DSC. Despite the transition temperature express insignificantly different, the degree of crystallinity of nanocomposite was increase, indicating that chitin whisker would induce the crystallinity of PLA."
"Preparation of transparent cellulose/PMMA composite sheet from cellulose aerogel  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.In this work, wet cellulose aerogel sheet was prepared via NaOH/urea dissolution system followed by multiple solvent exchanges. Firstly, hyacinth cellulose solution was prepared and then cast into plastic mold. The casting solution was left standing to become solid hydrogel. Then, multiple solvent exchanges by water was carried out in order to remove NaOH and urea completely to obtain wet hydrogel. Then, transparent cellulose sheet was successfully prepared by backfilling the nano/micro sized aerogel channel with a refractive index matching polymer which was PMMA emulsion in this study. The transparent cellulose sheet exhibited 80-90 percent transparency. In contrast, cellulose aerogel exhibited relatively low percent transmittance only 8.24%. In addition, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of transparent cellulose sheet with a thickness of 0.5 mm (10.45 ppmK-1) was significantly lower that pure PMMA sheet (79.70 ppmK-1), indicating that aerogel based transparent cellulose exhibited lower thermal expansion than neat plastic."
"Graphene/thermoplastic polyurethane composites  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene nanocomposites were successfully prepared by mixing masterbatches with neat polymers using the melt compounding process. Graphene was obtained from graphite by the chemical mean. Graphite was initially converted into graphite oxide which was then converted to graphene oxide. Graphene oxide was then reduced by L-ascorbic acid to obtain graphene. The effects of graphene addition on thermal and morphological properties of nanocomposite were studied by a differential scanning calorimeter, a thermal gravimetric analyzer and a scanning electron microscope. TPU/graphene nanocomposites showed higher melting temperature compared to TPU. On the other hand, heat of fusion of nanocomposites was lowered. TPU and TPU/graphene nanocomposites have two steps of decomposition. The first degradation of TPU occurred at higher temperature compared with nanocomposites but the second degradation showed the opposite results. The percentage of residue after thermal degradation of nanocomposites was lower than that of TPU. For surface morphology, nanocomposite exhibited the rougher surface comparing with TPU and well graphene dispersion in TPU phase was achieved. Nevertheless, there were some agglomeration of graphene."
"Synthesis of graphene functionalized melamine and its application for supercapacitor electrode  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.In this work, we describe the development of graphene as energy storage materials that are supercapacitors. Melamine is successfully used as a Nitrogen source for graphene doping by simple reflux process. The influence of reducing agent ratio is also investigated to study the degree of reducing of graphene functionalized melamine on capacitive behavior. At reducing agent/graphene ratio of 1:1, the nitrogen functional graphene can deliver the highest specific capacitance of 333.38 F/g at 10mV/sec, which is much higher than that obtained from bare graphene. The increasing of reducing agent ratio higher than 1 tends to decrease the capacitive values of graphene functionalized melamine confirming the efficiency of doped Nitrogen content on graphene. This N-doped graphene feature can be viewed as the potentially ideal candidate materials for supercapacitor application."
"Preparation and electrical properties of activated carbon grafted with polyaniline nanofiber  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Activated carbon (AC) grafted with polyaniline (PANi) was prepared. Firstly, surface modifications of AC were carried out using sulfuric acid/nitric acid and followed by sodium hydrosulfite/ammonia, resulting in nitro group functionalized AC and free amine group functionalized AC, respectively. Functionalized groups were confirmed by FTIR analysis. Then, PANi was deposited onto modified AC surface through oxidation polymerization of aniline using ammonium persulfate as an initiator. After that, AC-NO2/PANi composites (1:0.25 and 1:0.5) and AC-NH2-g-PANi (1:0.25 and 1:0.5) were prepared. SEM images revealed that PANi was successfully deposited onto modified AC surface due to polar-polar interaction (in case of AC-NO2) and grafting reaction (in case of AC-NH2). Interestingly, at low aniline concentration, PANi nanofiber was produced, resulting in PANi having the highest surface area. As a result, the PANi nanofiber on porous activated carbon electrode exhibited high EDL capacitance value of 242 F/g. In contrast, PANi granular form exhibited significantly decreased in EDL capacitance value."
"Removal of Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Cd2+ from wastewater using fly ash based geopolymer as an adsorbent  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.This work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of fly ash based geopolymer powder as an adsorbent for heavy metals in aqueous solution. The structure of synthesized geopolymer was found to be highly amorphous due to the dissolution of fly ash phase. Moreover, the fly ash geopolymer powder has higher surface area compares to original fly ash with specific surface area of 85.01 m2/g and 0.83 m2/g, respectively. For this reason, the geopolymer powder has much higher removal efficiency compared to the original fly ash powder. The removal efficiency was affected by contact time, geopolymer amount, heavy metal initial concentration, pH, and temperature. The four heavy metals were chosen (Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Cd2+) for adsorption test. The highest heavy metal removal capacity was obtained at pH 5. The geopolymer powder adsorbed metal cations in the order of Pb2+>Cu2+>Cd2+>Ni2+. In addition, Langmuir model is more suitable for fly ash geopolymer powder adsorption of heavy metal ions in aqueous solution than Freundlich model. The results showed that the fly ash geopolymer powder has high efficiency for removal metal which could be employed excellent alternative for wastewater treatment."
"Flowering phenology and trap pollination of the rare endemic plant ceropegia thaithongiae in montane forest of northern Thailand  2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.Although Ceropegia species are well known for their complex pitfall flowers that temporarily imprison their pollinators, various aspects of their pollination ecology are still unknown. This study investigated flowering phenology, functional floral traits, and insect visitation in a natural population of a rare endemic lithophyte, Ceropegia thaithongiae Kidyoo. Flowering of C. thaithongiae was not synchronous but staggered. Anthesis lasted mostly 1–2 days, but its duration was shorter in flowers with a pollinium inserted into the stigmatic chamber. Several different insects visited flowers, but only chloropid and milichiid flies were effective pollinators. At anthesis, the epithelial osmophores on the corolla lobes emitted a floral scent that was simple in composition. Nectar of high viscosity was exuded from the nectaries hidden behind the guide rails. When transported by an insect, the pollinarium was attached to bristles on the mouthparts. Size and shape of the thin pellucid margin of the pollinium enable it to fit into the stigmatic chamber in a lock-and-key arrangement. The pollen transfer efficiency was 6.8%. The plant’s staggered flowering and pollination-induced ending of anthesis are advantageous in decreasing competition for pollinators when flower-visiting insects are scarce."
"Tuning of HDPE properties for 3D printing  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The objective of this study is to improve high density polyethylene (HDPE) properties for 3D printing by addition of graphene and low density polyethylene (LDPE). Graphene was prepared by modified Hummer's method. The prepared graphene was characterized by the infrared spectroscopy and the X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Graphene/HDPE and LDPE/HDPE composites were successfully prepared through the melt-blending technique using a twin-screw extruder. The melt flow index (MFI) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed to characterize neat HDPE and the modified HDPE. FTIR and XRD results show that graphite was successfully changed into graphene completely and MFI of graphene/HDPE and LDPE/HDPE decreased as the amount of graphene and LDPE in the composite blends increased. DSC results show that the addition of low crystalline polymers can reduce a crystallization temperature and crystallinity content."
"Poly(lactic acid)/poly(vinyl alcohol)/graphene nanocomposites  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is an interesting material as an environmentally-friendly replacement of petroleum-based polymers. However, some properties need improvements in order to commercially utilized PLA. In this work, graphene is used as a reinforcing filler and poly(vinyl alcohol) is used as a carrier to enhance dispersion of graphene in PLA matrix. The addition of graphene aims at improving the mechanical and thermal properties of PLA. The functional groups of graphene were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical property testing was performed using a universal testing machine. The thermal properties were measured through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As a result, the Young's modulus and the thermal properties of PLA composites increased as the amount of graphene in the composites increased due to improved dispersion of graphene in PLA matrix."
"Effects of poly(methyl methacrylate)-encapsulated nanosilica on mechanical properties of poly(lactic acid)/ethylene vinyl acetate nanocomposites  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.In this study, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was melt mixed with three weight percentages (10-30wt%) of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) in an internal mixer, followed by a compression molding. According to a better combination of mechanical properties, the 90/10 (w/w) PLA/EVA was selected for preparing hybrid nanocomposites with three loadings (1, 3 and 5 parts per hundred of resin, phr) of poly(methyl methacrylate)-encapsulated nanosilica (PMMA-nSiO2). The nanolatex of PMMA-nSiO2 was synthesized via in situ differential microemulsion polymerization. The obtained PMMA-nSiO2 showed a core-shell morphology with nSiO2 as a core and PMMA as a shell, having an average diameter of 43.4nm. The influences of the EVA and PMMA-nSiO2 on the impact strength and the tensile properties of the PLA/EVA nanocomposites were studied and compared. It is found that the impact strength and the tensile properties of the 90/10 (w/w) PLA/EVA were improved with the appropriate amounts of the EVA and PMMA-nSiO2."
"Preparation and properties of poly(lactic acid)/epoxidized natural rubber/nano-silica composites  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.This study aimed to improve the toughness property of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) by incorporating epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), an elastomeric material and silica nanoparticle (nSiO2), a spherical inorganic nanofiller. ENR with 30mol% epoxidation (ENR 30) was first prepared via in situ epoxidation of natural rubber by performic acid generated from the reaction between formic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the latex stage. The PLA was melt blended with three weight percentages (10, 20 and 30wt%) of ENR in an internal mixer, followed by a compression molding. The effects of ENR loadings on the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the blends were first investigated. It was found that the addition of ENR 30 increased the toughness property of the blends. The blend at 20wt% ENR 30 exhibited the highest impact strength and elongation at break, and so was selected for preparing nanocomposites with three loadings (1, 2 and 3 parts per hundred of resins) of nano-silica (nSiO2). The results showed that all PLA/ENR 30/nSiO2 nanocomposites exhibited higher impact strength and thermal stability than the neat 80/20 PLA/ENR 30 blend."
"Use of magnesium hydroxide as flame retardant in poly(lactic acid)/high impact polystyrene/wood flour composites  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.This work aimed to use magnesium hydroxide (MH) as a flame retardant in poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/high impact polystyrene (HIPS)/wood flour (WF) composite. The 80/20/20 PLA/HIPS/WF composite was melt mixed with three loadings (20, 30 and 40 phr) of MH on a twin screw extruder, followed by an injection molding. The prepared wood-plastic composites (WPCs) were investigated for their impact strength (IS), tensile strength (TS), Young's modulus (E), elongation at break (EB), flammability and morphology. The results showed that the 80/20/20 PLA/HIPS/WF composite exhibited higher IS, TS and E than the neat PLA, but at the expense of reducing the EB. It was also found that the WPCs filled with MH at all loadings provided much higher flame resistance and E over the neat PLA, HIPS, PLA/HIPS blend and PLA/HIPS/WF composite. Therefore, the MH could play an effective role as flame retardant in the WPCs."
"Collagen and mPCL-TCP scaffolds induced differential bone regeneration in ovary-intact and ovariectomized rats  2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reservedBACKGROUND: The data on biomaterial-mediated bone regeneration directly comparing commercially available scaffolds in aging and osteoporotic conditions remain sparse. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) and a medical grade polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate (mPCL-TCP) scaffold on calvarial defect healing in ovary-intact and ovariectomized rats. METHODS: Forty-two, 5-month old female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham (OVI) or ovariectomy (OVX) groups (n = 21). When rats reached 6 months old, 7 mm diameter calvarial defects were created and treated, further dividing each group into blood clot control, mPCL-TCP, or ACS subgroups (n = 7). After four weeks, the calvarial specimens were evaluated using micro-computed tomography for bone volume fraction (BVF), and histopathology. RESULTS: The effects of ovariectomy were confirmed by changes in body, uterine, and vaginal weight, and osteopenia in the femur. A significant increase in BVF was observed in ACS-subgroups compared with their respective control groups (p < 0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed no cellular inflammatory infiltrate in any group. Fibrous tissue encapsulated the mPCL-TCP, while the ACS was well-integrated with the bone matrix. The OVX groups presented more osteoid and enlarged marrow cavities compared with the OVI groups. CONCLUSION: ACS scaffold enhanced calvarial bone regeneration in OVI and OVX rats after four weeks."
"Deep multi-label 3D ConvNet for breast cancer diagnosis in DBT with inversion augmentation  2018 SPIE.Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a pseudo-3D breast image, which is a collection of 2D slice images. It is increasingly being used for detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. In comparison to mammography (2D breast image), DBT provides higher sensitivity (true-positive rate). Recently, there have been many state-of-the-art methods for the detection of masses and calcifications in DBT. However, these previous studies can identify just only one type of breast lesions (abnormality class), while there can be multiple breast lesions simultaneously (multi-label classification); each of them requires different treatment procedures. In this paper, we present an end-to-end multi-label classification approach that takes into account the pseudo-3D nature of DBT and able to automatically detect two major types of malignant lesions: soft tissue and calcifications. The proposed network is a real 3D convolutional network (ConvNet) with two additional strategies: global kernel and global average pooling. Also, an inversion augmentation is invented; it does not only alleviate a small size of training data, but also help an occlusion overlapping issue. Such system can be used to support radiologists in DBT analysis by prompting suspicious locations. Our in-house dataset consists of 115 DBT volumes, including 91 volumes of cancer detected cases (contained biopsy-proven malignant lesions) and 24 volumes of normal cases. The experimental results show that our approach yields a promising result for the classification of malignant lesions: 72% accuracy with f1-score at 0.842. Moreover, a multi-label classification network is able to detect concurrent lesions in 3 of 6 volumes in the testing set."
"Role of the immune system in autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Background: The evidence based supports that multifactorial and complex immune interactions play a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but contradictory findings are also reported. Objective: The aim of this selective review was to identify trends in the research literature on this topic, focusing on immunology and other aberrations with respect to the different ASD subtypes. Methods: This selective review is based on original and review articles written in English and identified in literature searches of PubMed. Results: Several studies have found that the risk of ASD is greater among children whose mothers suffered from autoimmune diseases while pregnant. Moreover, individuals with ASD show increased levels of antibodies that are specific for several specific proteins. Studies also show that mothers of children with ASD have antibodies against fetal brain proteins. There are also reports on the associations between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and ASD. Finally, infections in mothers during pregnancy are linked to an increased risk of ASD. Conclusion: We propose that the large inconsistencies in findings among studies in the field are due to differences in subdiagnoses among the included children with ASD. Well-phenotyped ASD samples are needed to understand the biological and immunological mechanisms underpinning ASD and its subdiagnoses. Future research should apply new strategies to scrutinize the link between ASD and changes in immune responsivity. Important new research avenues are to investigate the associations (a) between different ASD phenotypes and aberrations in (auto)immune pathways and (b) between reduced natural regulatory autoimmune responses during pregnancy, which are in turn associated with increased oxidative and nitrosative stress in maternal blood and putative detrimental effects in the offspring."
"Bond behavior between embedded through-section bars and concrete  IJASEIT.The embedded through-section (ETS) method has been used as a new technique to strengthen the reinforced concrete beams in shear. In this technique, the fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) or steel rods are embedded through previously drilled holes into the concrete core. Most of the previous research concluded that the ETS method was proved to be particularly efficient and increase significantly of the shear resistance. This paper focuses on the bond response between the ETS bars and concrete substrate. Three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) models of concrete blocks strengthened by ETS bars using ANSYS 15.0 are built and considered. Furthermore, the analytical formulation of the slip profiles is offered to assess the bond performances of the ETS rods to concrete.

"The effects of tryptophan catabolites on negative symptoms and deficit schizophrenia are partly mediated by executive impairments: Results of partial least squares path modeling  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Aim & Objective: To delineate the associations between executive impairments and changes in tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) patterning, negative symptoms and deficit schizophrenia. Methods: We recruited 80 schizophrenic patients and 40 healthy controls and assessed 10 key cognitive tests using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Results: Partial Least Squares path modeling shows that a large part of the variance in negative symptoms and the deficit phenotype (39-53%) is explained by executive impairments, TRYCAT levels and male sex and that 53.4% of the variance in executive impairments is explained by TRYCATs, lower education, age and a familial history of psychosis. Specific indirect effects of TRYCATs, age and education on negative symptoms are mediated by executive impairments. Nevertheless, sustained attention, memory and emotion recognition also mediate the effects of TRYCATS, lower education and male sex on negative symptoms. Conclusion: Deficit schizophrenia is accompanied by a broader spectrum of cognitive impairments than nondeficit schizophrenia, including executive functions, sustained attention, episodic and semantic memory and emotion recognition. Furthermore, neuro-immune disorders underpin executive impairments, whilst neuro-immune disorders coupled with executive and other cognitive impairments to a large extent determine negative symptoms and the deficit phenotype."
"H∞ Observer for Descriptor Nonlinear Systems with Nonlinear Output Equations  2018 AACC.This paper deals with the problem of H∞ observer design for a class of descriptor nonlinear systems with nonlinear output measurements. The established result is broad and can be applied to many estimation problems in nonlinear systems, such as unknown input estimation, fault diagnosis and state estimation. Based on the introduction of new assumptions involving a rank condition that specifies a constraint between the numbers of allowed unknown inputs, nonlinear functions, states and the number of measurements, a new Linear Matrix Inequality condition (LMI) for observer design is proposed. The obtained LMI is more general and less conservative, from a feasibility point of view, than those existing in the literature."
"The Evolution of Trump’s Image in Russian Media  2018 SAGE Publications.The article examines the dynamics of the Donald Trump’s myth creation in Russia through nominations in media discourse. Mythological nominations are objects of reflected reality which are capable of directing public opinion and creating some desired public attitude on irrational levels. The article generalizes nominations-antinomies of Donald Trump in the Russian political media discourse during the information confrontation between Russia and the United States. The analysis is based on the universal sample of articles published in three major Russian newspapers during the period from the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017 until May 31, 2018. The results of the discursive and content analysis, together with semiotic and semantic analysis of the nominations, indicate the intention of forming positive image of Trump in Russia. The only notable exceptions in this generally positive narrative were 4 months which coincide with the following events: missile strike on Syria military base in April 2017, threats to North Korea and withdrawal from the Paris climate deal in September 2017, record military budget and relocation of the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in December 2017, further tightening economic sanctions, trade and military activity in Syria in April 2018. During the periods surrounding these events, the discourse was sharply reversed from a generally positive validation of Trump to a negative one."
"Expression and characterization of functional single-chain variable fragment against norfloxacin in Pichia pastoris GS115  All Rights Reserved.A functional single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of mouse monoclonal antibody against norfloxacin was expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris GS115, purified and characterized. Gene encoding monoclonal antibody against norfloxacin was transformed to P. pastoris GS115 using the pJM01 plasmid. Integration of the plasmid into the genome was verified by PCR and DNA sequencing analysis. After screening for the transformant and production of the selected scFv, the norfloxacin-binding ability was determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Eight transformats (O1-O8) were obtained from the transformation of P. pastoris GS115 with PmeI-linearized pJM01. PCR products detected by gel electrophoresis confirmed that pJM01 expression cassette was integrated at AOX1 promoter. After screening all transformants for high expression of the recombinant scFv, transformant O5 was selected for antibody production and purification. Detection of norfloxacin by ELISA with the recombinant scFv fragment was successful albeit with lower sensitivity compared to the original monoclonal antibody. In SPR analysis, our recombinant scFv fragments have the binding capability to norfloxacin equivalent to the original antibody with the average angle shift of 580 ± 133 and 505 ± 28 mDegree, respectively. The functional recombinant scFv of monoclonal antibody against norfloxacin successfully produced by methylotrophic yeast, P. pastoris GS115."
"Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids as Multifunctional Secondary Metabolites in Cyanobacteria: From Biochemical to Application Aspects  2019 Elsevier B.V.Cyanobacteria are valuable and prolific sources of natural products with intricate chemical structures and potent biological activities. In this review chapter, we emphasize on the natural UV sunscreen, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from cyanobacteria. We further describe several important MAAs aspects, covering basic features, molecular structure, biosynthesis, regulation, biological activities, and potential applications. MAAs also offer great potential for the development of novel UV sunscreens due to their UV-absorbing and antioxidant properties. Furthermore, recent patents related to the MAAs are also reviewed. Thus the chapter will impart comprehensive knowledge on cyanobacterial MAAs and potential applications in cosmeceutical, pharmaceutical, and biomedical fields. The emerging new technologies of high-resolution separation and detection systems possessing very high sensitivity (i.e., electrospray ionization, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization) are considered to play a predominant role in the isolation and identification of novel MAAs having structurally complex molecules. Future perspectives include emerging new technologies for further exploration and discovery of novel MAAs derived from marine and high-altitude inhabiting cyanobacteria in particular."
"Relation between early postoperative deviation and long-term outcome after unilateral lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection for adult exotropia  2018, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office). All rights reserved.● AIM: To evaluate the relationship between early postoperative deviation and long-term outcome after unilateral recession and resection surgery for adult exotropia, and to evaluate exotropic shift after surgery. ● METHODS: This was a retroprospective study involving adult patients with exotropia who underwent unilateral recession and resection surgery and were followed up for at least 2y. The results were evaluated at 2y and the final visit. Factors influencing a successful outcome were analyzed. Early postoperative deviation at 1wk was used to evaluate relationship with long-term outcome. The long-term outcome was classified into 3 groups: successful, acceptable, and poor. Successful outcome was defined as a distance deviation between esodeviation 8 prism diopters (PD) and exodeviation 10 PD. ● RESULTS: Forty-two patients were enrolled. The mean age at surgery was 26y (range, 15-49y). The median follow-up period was 30mo (range, 24-108mo). Successful outcome was found in 81% of patients at 2y and in 71% at the final visit. Overcorrection at 1wk postoperatively was associated with a successful outcome at 2y. Initial postoperative alignment between orthotropia and esodeviation of 8 PD had the highest chance of a successful outcome (RR=2.2). The mean postoperative exotropic drift was 4.7 PD at the first month and 9.3 PD at 2y. ● CONCLUSION: Initial postoperative deviation can predict long-term outcome after unilateral recession and resection surgery for adult exotropia. The most desirable outcome at 1wk post-operatively was orthotropia to small esodeviation. Most patients have exotropic drift at a subsequent follow-up, especially in the first month after surgery."
"Comparing Life Cycle Cost of Public and PPP Transportation Infrastructure in Thailand: An Empirical Evidence  2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.Infrastructure plays an important role in promoting short and long-term economic growth. However, due to the nature and characteristics of infrastructure projects which requires large amount of capital, private involvement in infrastructure development, also known as public-private-partnership or PPP, has therefore become an alternative to traditional public procurement. The main arguments for deploying PPP are three folds. First, PPP helps governments tap private resources for funding needed investment in infrastructure projects. Second, private's expertise in managing an infrastructure project is highly recognized. And, finally, PPP is believed by many to be delivered in a manner that is more cost-effective than the traditional methods. However, the perception that PPP provides value for money (VfM) over traditional procurement still lacks empirical evidence, especially in Thailand. Accordingly, the main objective of this research project is to develop a computational model that can compare the life cycle cost (LCC) of public and PPP infrastructure projects. Data collection from a group of public and private transportation projects in Thailand will be employed to compare the average life cycle cost between them. The results of this study will provide additional empirical evidence to the body of knowledge in the field of infrastructure management."
"Interactive laboratory classes enhance neurophysiological knowledge in Thai medical students  2018. The American Physiological Society. All Rights Reserved.Wongjarupong N, Niyomnaitham D, Vilaisaktipakorn P, Suk-siriworaboot T, Qureshi SP, Bongsebandhu-phubhakdi S. Interactive laboratory classes enhance neurophysiological knowledge in Thai medical students. Adv Physiol Educ 42: 140-145, 2018; doi: 10.1152/advan.00046.2017.—Interactive laboratory class (ILC) is a two-way communication teaching method that encourages students to correlate laboratory findings with materials from lectures. In Thai medical education, active learning methods are uncommon. This paper aims to establish 1) if ILCs would effectively promote physiology learning; 2) if effectiveness would be found in both previously academically high-performing and low-performing students; and 3) the acceptability of ILCs to Thai medical students as a novel learning method. Two hundred seventy-eight second-year medical students were recruited to this study. We conducted three ILC sessions, which followed corresponding lectures. We carried out multiple-choice pre-and post-ILC assessments of knowledge and compared by repeated-measures ANOVA and unpaired t-test. Subgroup analysis was performed to compare high-performance (HighP) and low-performance (LowP) students. After the ILCs, participants self-rated their knowledge and satisfaction. Post-ILC test scores increased significantly compared with pre-ILC test scores in all three sessions. Mean scores of each post-ILC test increased significantly from pre-ILC test in both LowP and HighP groups. More students self-reported a “very high” and “high” level of knowledge after ILCs. Most students agreed that ILCs provided more discussion opportunity, motivated their learning, and made lessons more enjoyable. As an adjunct to lectures, ILCs can enhance knowledge in medical students, regardless of previous academic performance. Students perceived ILC as useful and acceptable. This study supports the active learning methods in physiology education, regardless of cultural context."
"Effects of calcination and pretreatment temperatures on the catalytic activity and stability of H2-treated WO3/SiO2 catalysts in metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene  The Royal Society of Chemistry.The effects of calcination and pretreatment temperatures of the H2-treated WO3/SiO2 catalysts in metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene to propylene were investigated. The results showed that pretreatment with pure hydrogen over the non-calcined catalysts resulted in higher activity and stability than the calcined catalysts, and the hydrogen pretreatment temperature at 650 °C offered the highest 2-butene conversion and propylene selectivity. The calcination of the catalyst before hydrogen pretreatment was proved to be unnecessary. As revealed by various characterization results from N2 physisorption, XRD, TEM, UV-Vis, Raman, in situ H2-TPR, in situ NH3-DRIFTS and in situ NH3-TPD techniques, activity of the metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene to propylene was related to tungsten dispersion on the support, WO2.83 and WO2 phase composition, and isolated surface tetrahedral tungsten oxide species. The stability of the metathesis reaction was also related to the total acidity and the acid sites of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites."

"Bartonella henselae infective endocarditis with dissemination: A case report and literature review in Southeast Asia  2018 The AuthorsBartonella is among the most common causes of culture-negative infective endocarditis, with B. henselae being one of the most frequently reported species. The clinical presentation of Bartonella endocarditis is similar to that of subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by other bacteria and the diagnosis can be challenging since the organism is difficult to isolate using standard microbiologic culture techniques. In clinical practice, Bartonella endocarditis is usually diagnosed based on serology. To date, only a handful of cases of infective endocarditis caused by Bartonella have been reported in Thailand. Here, we report the case of 51-year-old Thai male with B. henselae endocarditis with dissemination to the lungs, bones, subcutaneous tissue, epididymis, and lymph nodes with a successful outcome."
"Triple detection modes for Hg2+ sensing based on a NBD-fluorescent and colorimetric sensor and its potential in cell imaging  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.A new fluorescent sensor (DiNBD) was successfully synthesized; the sensor consisted of two 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl (NBD) units that were covalently attached to 2-(4-(2-aminoethylthio)butylthio)ethanamine by a conventional two-step synthesis. It could serve as a colorimetric and fluorescent sensor for Hg2+ in aqueous acetonitrile solutions with high selectivity over other competitive metal ions. Upon Hg2+ titration, the sensor exhibited ""ON-OFF"" fluorescence quenching at 526 nm (λex 458 nm) and ""OFF-ON"" fluorescence enhancement at 560 nm (λex 530 nm), which were accompanied by a colorimetric change from yellow to red. The Hg2+ detection limit of the sensor was 0.7 ppb, which is lower than the permitted level of Hg2+ in drinking water regulated by US EPA and WHO. Additionally, the fluorescence quenching and fluorescence enhancement of the sensor in the presence of Hg2+ could provide a precise determination of Hg2+ concentration due to their self-calibration. Moreover, the DiNBD fluorescent sensor could be used to determine Hg2+ in real samples and living cells, which could widen the applications of the developed sensor."
"Mesh-based multi-view normal integration with energy minimization using surface reflectance properties  2018, Vaclav Skala Union Agency. All rights reserved.We propose a technique to reconstruct a general 3D object using surface reflectance information from multiple viewpoints. Our core optimization framework uses multi-view normal integration, which can recovers water-tight surface of the object iteratively in a coarse to fine manner. The integration requires normal vector field from multiple viewpoints, which we can derive from surface reflectance. We then handle the topological changes if self-intersection occurs from the optimization. We also employ the idea of multi-resolution and weighted data heuristic which helps dealing with noisy data and improves both accuracy and optimization time. Our experiment shows that the framework is able to robustly recover 3D surface well with both synthetic and real data."
"Alu hypermethylation and high oxidative stress in patients with musculoskeletal tumors  2018 Woraruthai et al.Background. Alu is one of the non-autonomous element retrotransposons, constituting nearly 11% of the human DNA. Methylation changes of the Alu element can cause genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer development, ultimately leading to the development of cancer. Epigenetic factors may induce the aberrant methylation of Alu and also oxidative stress. However, current knowledge of Alu methylation and oxidative stress is limited. There are few studies that have evaluated Alu methylation and oxidative stress on musculoskeletal tumor progression. Therefore, the present study evaluated the status of Alu methylation in musculoskeletal (MS) tumor, adjacent tissues, and blood leukocytes from MS tumor subjects, as well as unaffected participants. Moreover, we also investigated the oxidative stress status in MS tumor subjects and the control participants and determined the correlation between Alu methylation in MS tumors and that in blood leukocytes. Methods. Musculoskeletal tumors from musculoskeletal tumor patients (n = 40) were compared to adjacent tissues (n = 40). The blood leukocytes from musculoskeletal tumor patients were compared to the blood leukocytes from controls (n = 107). Alu methylation status was analyzed using quantitative combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA). In addition, 8-hydroxy 20-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) values were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. Alu methylation values in MS tumors were statistically significantly higher than those in adjacent tissues (P =0:035). Similarly, Alu methylation statuses in the blood leukocytes of MS tumor subjects were statistically greater than those of control participants (P < 0.001). Moreover, there was a positive association between Alu methylation levels in MS tumors and blood leukocytes (r = 0:765, P < 0:001). In addition, the highest tertile was significantly associated with the risk of MS tumors (OR = 14.17, 95% CI [5.08-39.51]; P < 0:001). The 8-OHdG values in MS tumors were statistically higher than in adjacent tissues (P < 0:001) and circulating 8-OHdG levels were substantially greater in MS tumor subjects than in the control participants (P < 0:001). Discussion. These findings suggest that Alu methylation in blood leukocytes and plasma 8-OHdG might represent non-invasive biomarkers to help diagnoseMStumors. Therefore, Alu hypermethylation and high oxidative stress might be involved in the pathogenesis of the musculoskeletal tumors."
"Ensemble effort estimation using selection and genetic algorithms Copyright  2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.Software effort estimation plays a vital role in software project management. Several single estimation methods have been introduced vying to be the best estimation method. However, it is difficult to decide which method offers the best estimation result. This study proposes an ensemble effort estimation from several single estimation methods which yield different estimations but comparably high accuracy. The proposed technique employs a correlation-based feature selection algorithm to choose methods out of twelve methods derived from combinations of four transformation and three learning techniques. The ensemble then uses a genetic algorithm to build a mathematical function to compute one combined estimation from those selected method estimations. Experiments are set up based on six benchmark data sets to evaluate estimation performance. The resulting measure of error metrics show that the proposed ensemble technique deploying only necessary estimation methods can yield more accurate estimation than the best method from the twelve methods."
"Characterization of lactic acid-producing bacillus coagulans strains with their antibacterial activity and l-lactic acid production  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Objectives: The objective is to study the screening of antibacterial activity, identification, and L-lactic acid production of spore-forming Bacillus isolates. Materials and Methods: Fourteen Bacillus isolates were characterized based on their phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. The antibacterial activity was determined by agar diffusion method, and lactic acid production was analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography. Four isolates that produced above 85.0 g/L of lactic acid were selected for lactic acid fermentation using mid-log seed culture. Results: All isolates were identified as Bacillus coagulans based on the phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (99.02–99.78 %). Strain JC-15 and JC-16 exhibited antibacterial activity against Kocuria rhizophila ATCC 9341. All isolates produced L-lactic acid ranged from 56.7 ± 0.54 to 92.05 ± 0.23 g/L at 37°C under microaerophilic conditions with 99.12 ± 0.10–100 ± 0.00% optical purity of lactic acid. B. coagulans PP-16 showed highest L-lactic acid concentration at 92.05 ± 0.23 g/L, yield of 0.77 ± 0.00 g/g, and productivity of 0.96 ± 0.00 g/L.h. After controlled seed preparation conditions, the four selected strains produced L-lactic acid in the range of 93.25 ± 0.07–103.25 ± 0.21 g/L and 102.85 ± 0.49–111.85 ± 0.21 g/L at 37°C with 98.75 ± 0.00–99.70 ± 0.01 and 88.66 ± 0.02–99.60 ± 0.01% optical purity of lactic acid under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Yield and productivity were also increased. Fermentation under anaerobic conditions showed higher L-lactic acid titers and yield, whereas microaerophilic conditions gave higher productivity. Strain PP-16 gave the highest optical purity in both conditions."
"Effect of temperature and time on free amino acid profile in Thai chicken bone soup stock preparation  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Introduction: Soup stock is the basic material for cooking various types of food, including Thai food. The general practice to prepare good quality Thai soup stock is to gently boil chicken bone at 85-95°C for 1-3 h. Free amino acids (AAs) including essential AA (EAA) present in the soup stock play an important role for the supply of nutrients and the modulation of taste and palatability. Chicken bone contains key taste-active compounds such as glutamate (Glu) which is responsible for the umami taste. However, no data have been reported on the content of free AA and the changes in its concentration in chicken bone soup stock as a function of boiling time. Method: Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of temperature and boiling time on the AA profile and their concentrations during soup stock production. The concentrations of free AA during the heating of the chicken bone soup stocks at three different temperatures (85°C, 90°C, and 95°C) for 30, 60, 120, and 180 min were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results and Conclusion: The results showed the compositions of AA (19 AA) in Thai chicken bone stock prepared in each condition were similar, and major free AAs in the stock were Glu and alanine. The total free AA concentration slowly rose with increasing temperature and heating time, except for glutamine. The total AA concentration was the highest in soup stock boiled at 90°C and 95°C for 180 min (143.14 ± 3.30 and 145.99 ± 9.20 mg/100 ml, respectively) and was significant higher than those at 85°C, 180 min. The concentration of Glu was also found to be highest when the stock was boiled at 90 and 95°C, 180 min (28.61±1.0 and 28.80±2.21 mg/100 ml, respectively), whereas the concentration of EAA (52.00 ± 2.96 mg/100 ml) was significantly highest in the soup stock cooked at 95°C for 180 min. Sensory evaluation demonstrated that boiling time, but not temperature, improved sensory attributes of the soup stocks. Those boiled for 120 and 180 min obtained significantly higher scores for taste, color, thickness, and overall liking than those boiled for 30 and 60 min. This result corresponded to a significant increase of Glu concentration from 120 min of heating. This revealed that the palatability of Thai chicken bone soup stock might be affected by Glu, an umami taste substance. This finding might suggest that the condition to obtain good quality chicken bone stock in terms of taste and nutritional values, especially EAA content, is to gently boil at 90-95°C for 180 min."
"Effects of age, hydration level, and cosmetic treatment on skin mechanical properties of Thai  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Purpose: Age and skin hydration influence skin mechanical properties. However, correlation between hydration improved by cosmetic and mechanical properties is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between age, intrinsic skin hydrations, skin hydration after topical treatment, and skin mechanical parameters of different age ranges. Patients and Methods: A total of 123 healthy volunteers, aged 18–55, were divided into three age groups. Skin hydration and biomechanical properties were evaluated using Corneometer® and Cutometer®, respectively. Subsequently, 61 healthy women aged 30–55 were measured for skin hydration and biomechanical parameters after 8 weeks application of microemulsion or nanoemulsion. The changes in each parameter and their correlation were evaluated. Results: Skin capacitance correlated to some mechanical parameters only in young volunteers. Only gloss elasticity (R2) presented strong negative correlation with age in 30–40-year-old volunteers while all elasticity parameters (R2, R5, and R7) showed significant negative correlations with age in 41–55 years old volunteers. Microemulsion or nanoemulsion significantly improved skin hydration; however, it did not always affect elasticity parameters. Conclusion: Skin elasticity decreased with age and changes in R2 were firstly observed. Decrease in R2 parameter could, then, be the first sign of skin aging. Skin hydration and elasticity were not related in any age. Improvement in skin hydration and elasticity by topical treatment was independent and based on individual formulation."
"A Novel and Facile Nanoclay Aerogel Masterbatch toward Exfoliated Polymer-Clay Nanocomposites through a Melt-Mixing Process  2018 Wasuthep Luecha and Rathanawan Magaraphan.This research employed a novel and facile approach called nanoclay aerogel masterbatch. This innovative technique was conducted by attaching the clay layers directly onto a mobile polymer, for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG), in order to modify the clay layer through PEG-clay intercalation and PEG-hydrogen bonding. This state was maintained with a small amount of the anionic polymer hydrogel, for example, kappa-carrageenan (KC), and turning it into a highly porous and fragile structure by freeze-drying, thus a so-called nanoclay aerogel masterbatch. The facile nanoclay aerogel masterbatch was able to be attained even at high clay loadings (55-67 wt.% of the inorganic clay content) with constant PEG and KC loadings. The interlayer spacing enlargement of the nanoclay galleries was around 17 Å with the typical lamellar morphology like a house of cards structure. The density values were within 0.108-0.122 g·cm-3. The thermal stabilities were up to 270°C, revealing better thermal stability for melt mixing with the commodity plastics at a high melting temperature. The flowability and processability were certified by the melt flow index (MFI) results. The highest nanoclay loading capacity (67 wt.%) of the achieved nanoclay aerogel masterbatch was selected to prepare PS-clay nanocomposites via a melt-mixing process. The comparative nanocomposites were produced by using organoclay. The results of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibited that the exfoliated morphologies were obtained at all clay contents (1-3 wt.%); however, the intercalated structure was gained by using organoclay. The outstanding transparency and brightness were remarked from the specimens prepared by using the nanoclay aerogel masterbatch. The brownish specimens were observed by using organoclay. The significant improvements of tensile properties, glass transition temperature (Tg), and thermal stability were noticed from the nanocomposites prepared using the nanoclay aerogel masterbatch."
"Tsavoenones A-C: Unprecedented polyketides with a 1,7-dioxadispiro[4.0.4.4]tetradecane core from the lichen: Parmotrema tsavoense  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.New racemic dispiranic polyketides, tsavoenones A (1), B (2) and C (3), having a novel 1,7-dioxadispiro[4.0.4.4]tetradecane scaffold were isolated from the foliose lichen Parmotrema tsavoense. These compounds were structurally elucidated by extensive NMR analyses, comparison between experimental and theoretical 13C NMR data and X-ray crystallography. A putative biosynthetic scenario for the formation of 1-3 from parmosidone D, a meta-depsidone previously isolated from the same lichen material, was proposed. Tested for its cytotoxicity, 1 displayed a moderate activity against human myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line with an IC50 value of 66 μg mL-1."

Factors such as startup team capability, networks, quality of the mentors, and market efficiency play an equally important success in the incubation process."
"Charting the speaker-relatedness of impersonal pronouns: Contrastive evidence from English, French, and Thai  Minyao Huang, Jiranthara Srioutai, and Mélanie Gréaux 2018.Impersonal pronouns have been claimed to express generic reference that possesses a special connection to the speaker in unembedded contexts. Drawing on cross-linguistic data and new experimental findings, the authors propose a novel typology to capture the range of speaker-related interpretations associated with impersonal pronouns, and put forward a contextualist semantics that explicates the proposed typology. Contrastive evidence from English, French, and Thai will testify that the uses of comparable impersonal forms in these languages allow two dimensions of variation, pertaining to speaker/non-speaker reference and generalization/non-generalization. These variations are further construed as two dimensions of contextual development-at the levels of content and force-of an unspecified, merely generic meaning of the impersonal pronoun."
"Comparative study of methane hydrate formation and dissociation with hollow silica and activated carbon Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Natural gas hydrates are ice-like crystalline compounds and non-stoichiometric, and methane is trapped inside the water cages of the hydrates. In recent years, the hydrates have received much attention for natural gas storage and transportation. However, the use of methane hydrates has faced many challenges such as slow formation rate, low growth rate during hydrate formation, and low conversion ratio of gas to solid hydrates, leading to poor storage capacity. The addition of hydrate promoter is one of alternatives that may overcome these problems. In this work, porous materials, hollow silica (HSC) and activated carbon (AC), were investigated as the hydrate promoters at saturation condition, 1:10 HSC to water and 1:1 AC, to water on the hydrate formation and dissociation. The hydrate formation was conducted in a fix bed reactor at 8 MPa and 4 °C. The results showed that the methane hydrate formation using the HSC enhanced the water conversion to hydrates and the methane consumption at a greater extent than the methane hydrate formation using the AC. The decomposition of hydrates was performed by thermal stimulation with 21 °C temperature driving force. The results showed that the porous materials did not significantly affect the methane released and methane recovery from the hydrates."
"Performance evaluation of biogas-fed solid oxide fuel cell system coupling with CO2-selective membrane separator Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Biogas is an interesting fuel for hydrogen production in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). However, CO2 is a main composition of biogas, resulting in the dilution of hydrogen in syngas and low electrical efficiency of SOFC. To increase the hydrogen concentration, the power plant of biogas-fuelled SOFC requires the installation of carbon dioxide-selective membrane separator. The aim of this work is the performance analysis of the power plant of SOFC system utilizing biogas as fuel with and without installing the CO2-selective membrane separator. The simulation results showed that the membrane area has direct effect on the amount of permeated CO2 and the system performance. The increase of membrane area of separator enhances the SOFC and thermal efficiencies. However, the hydrogen loss in the retentate side increases and resulting in the decrement of system electrical efficiency. When considering performance of both systems, the SOFC efficiency of the SOFC system with CO2-selective membrane separator is superior to the conventional system about 7.54%. Also, its thermal efficiency is higher, compared to the conventional system."
"Heat exchanger network retrofit under fouling effects with cleaning schedule Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.The energy conservation by heat exchanger network (HEN) is important in process design according to increase in energy costs and global environmental concerns. To minimize the energy consumption with positive net present value (NPV), the retrofitted HEN plays an important role in process energy systems. The HEN retrofit model is based on stage-wise superstructure by Yee and Grossmann (1990). In addition, fouling deposition on the surface area of heat exchangers causes extra energy consumption, production loss and maintenance costs. The new proposed model is retrofitting HEN with fouling effects. This method achieves HEN with the optimal trade-offs between energy savings, and investment over operating period. For cleaning schedule, retrofitted HEN shows better capable to recover heat and higher NPV than base-case considered from a lower number of cleaning requirement. In this study, the proposed model is combination of cleaning schedule strategy and HEN retrofitting with fouling effect to achieve greater profits."
"Adsorption of methane and carbon dioxide on activated carbon and ZIF-8 (Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework) Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Comparative adsorption of methane and carbon dioxide on activated carbon and ZIF-8 (Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework) at 35 °C and up to 100 psi was made. In addition, different ratios of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with ZIF-8 were also investigated. The textural properties of adsorbents were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Quantachrom/Autosorb1-MP. All adsorbents were microporous materials. ZIF-8 has uniform crystalline structure, which is different from the amorphous structure of activated carbon. The result showed the increase in the methane and carbon dioxide adsorption when the pressure increased. ZIF-8 (pure) showed higher methane and carbon dioxide adsorption capacity than the activated carbon corresponding to its surface area, micropore volume, and average pore diameter. The addition of PVDF decreased the methane uptake. Furthermore, ZIF-8 (pure) and activated carbon adsorbed carbon dioxide more than methane, approximately twice due to its preferential adsorption towards carbon dioxide."
"The attitude towards the new rice direct-seeding device  2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.This study investigated users' behaviour concerning the attitude towards a new technology. The perceived characteristics of innovation, based on the diffusion of innovation theory, were selected as guidelines for data collection. A semi-structured in-depth interviewing qualitative technique was initially employed to assess the meaning of users' perceived characteristics of the rice direct seeding device. Members of three communities with high performances in rice producing were targeted purposively for the interviews. The data were analysed and rewritten as the content of the field survey questionnaire to measure the relation between the attitudes and the perceived characteristics. The questionnaires were assessed using a five-point Likert's scale. Cronbach's coefficient alpha was chosen for reliability testing. The respondents were rice producers. Multiple regression analysis qualitative technique was used to confirm the hypothesised relationships. The findings showed demographics and socio-economics, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity and observability influenced the attitude towards the direct seeding machine."
"The impact of financial and trade integration on business cycles in emerging markets  2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.This paper investigates the combined effect of financial integration (FI) and trade integration (TI) on macroeconomic volatility and business cycle synchronisation (BCS) in emerging markets. The study adopts a two-country real business cycle model with the adjustment cost of foreign asset holding, domestic leverage constraint and asymmetric financial accessibility. The results reveal that the impacts of FI and TI are intertwined. Increasing foreign asset holding generally has a weaker impact at high trade intensity. People with restricted financial access face large consumption volatility from increased FI under low trade. The findings suggest that trade could help mitigate the negative effect of FI on consumption smoothing, and FI could help lower output fluctuation and dependence on foreign economies, while trade increases them."
"Modelling and simulation of zinc-air flow battery with zinc regeneration process Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Reliable and low-cost electrical energy storage systems are required for grid integration of various intermittent sources of renewable energy. Zinc-air flow batteries have shown high potential for electricity storage application because of their high energy density at low cost. The flow batteries can reduce significantly the problem associated with the formation of dendritic zinc during recharge and the formation of a passivation film during discharge. The aims of this work include the development of mathematical models of a zinc-air flow battery (ZAFB). The developed model was implemented in MATLAB and validated with experimental data. The models were then used to investigate the behavior of the flow battery. The concentration of potassium hydroxide in the electrolyte, as well as the feed flow rate considerably affected the performance of ZAFB."
"Pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine and 24-week outcomes after switching from efavirenz in virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected adolescents  2018 International Medical Press.Background: Rilpivirine (RPV), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug, could be a favourable drug for maintenance therapy in HIV-infected adolescents because it has few long-term side effects. However, data among adolescents switching from efavirenz (EFV) to RPV are limited. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy of RPV in virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected adolescents after switching from EFV. Methods: Adolescents aged 12–18 years on EFV-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) were switched from EFV to RPV (25 mg, once daily). Intensive 24-h blood samplings at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h were performed 4 weeks after switching. PK parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental method and compared with published data from the PAINT and pooled ECHO/THRIVE substudies. HIV RNA level was measured at weeks 12 and 24. Biochemical profiles were measured at baseline and week 24. Results: From January to June 2016, 20 adolescents (12 male) were enrolled. Median (IQR) age was 16 (15–17) years and weight was 49 (42–59) kg. Mean (sd) AUC24 h, C24 h and Cmax of RPV were 2,041 (745) ng•h/ml, 69 (29) ng/ml and 143 (65) ng/ml, respectively. Median (IQR) Tmax was 5 (2–9) h. Four adolescents had C24 h <40 ng/ml. All PK parameters were comparable with published data. All adolescents remained virologically suppressed at week 24. Significant decreases in fasting total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein were observed (P-value <0.05). Conclusions: Virologically suppressed HIV-infected adolescents had adequate RPV exposure and remained virologically suppressed after switching from EFV. RPV can be used as long-term maintenance ART in HIV-infected adolescents."
"CYP2D6 genotype analysis of a Thai population: Platform comparison  2018 Future Medicine Ltd.The highly polymorphic CYP2D6 gene locus leads to a wide range of enzyme activity. Since there are limited data for Thai, the major aim was to investigate CYP2D6 genetic variation in a large Thai population (n = 920). CYP2D6 genotyping was performed using four different platforms. Genotype call rates of the Luminex xTAG® and AmpliChip CYP450 test were 96.5% and 87.4%, respectively. Based on Luminex xTAG® data, the most common alleles and genotypes were ∗1 0 (49.6%), ∗1 (24.6%), ∗2 (10.8%), ∗5 (6.7%), ∗41 (6.5%) and ∗1/∗10 (23.9%), ∗10/∗10 (21.5%), ∗2/∗10 (9.4%), ∗5/∗10 (6.9%), ∗10/∗41 (5.7%), respectively. Challenges and limitations of the platforms evaluated are discussed. These data add to our knowledge regarding interethnic variability in CYP2D6 activity and contribute to improving drug therapy in the Thai."
"Characterization of different Si-and Al-based catalysts with pd modification and their use for catalytic dehydration of ethanol 2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.This study aims to investigate the production of ethylene and diethyl ether from ethanol via catalytic dehydration using Si-and Al-based catalysts with Pd modification. First, six catalysts including Hbeta zeolite (HBZ), mixed phases of γ-χ-Al2O3 (M-Al) and γ-Al2O3 (G-Al) with and without Pd modification (0.5 wt%) were prepared. The catalytic dehydration of vaporized ethanol at temperature ranging from 200 to 400° C was performed over the catalysts. For ethylene production, the most promising catalyst is HBZ (giving ethylene yield of ca. 99% at 400° C), whereas Pd modification has no significant effect on ethylene production. Considering the production of diethyl ether, it is produced at lower temperature (ca. 250° C) than that of ethylene. The most active catalyst to produce diethyl ether is HBZ with Pd modification (giving diethyl ether yield of ca. 48% at 250° C). Thus, increased diethyl ether yield can be achieved with Pd modification at low temperature for the HBZ catalyst. Other catalysts such as M-Al and G-Al can also produce significant amounts of ethylene. To elucidate the effect of Pd modification on these catalysts, different characterization techniques such as nitrogen physisorption (BET and BJH methods), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption were performed and further discussed in more detail."
"Land reform, market adjustment, and rice market growth in Vietnam  2018 Tallinn University of Technology. All rights reserved.Vietnam is in transition in terms of economic development. Its economic sectors have seen incredible growth for decades, including agriculture. Vietnam's rice sector has increasingly expanded for decades regarding production and exports, while the country has experienced structural adjustment and policy reform, such as land reform. This article examines the production and trade effect of policy reform on the rice sector in Vietnam from 1976 to 2014. Using ordinary least squares model and marginal effects, the study found that policy reform has a positive effect on rice production and exports in Vietnam. Moreover, it was found that the Doi Moi macroeconomic reform has had a strong and positive effect on rice exports. This result shows that policy transition contributes to an increase in rice production and exports."
"Blind Corner Propagation Model for IEEE 802.11p Communication in Network Simulators  2018 Sanchai Jaktheerangkoon et al.Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) has been developed to enhance quality of road transportation. The development of safety applications could reduce number of road accidents. IEEE 802.11p is a promising standard for intervehicular communication, which would enable the connected-vehicle applications. However, in the well-known network simulators such as NS3 and Omnet, there is no propagation model that can simulate the IEEE 802.11p communication at blind corner realistically. Thus, in this paper, we conducted the real-world experiments of IEEE 802.11p in order to construct the model to describe the characteristics of the IEEE 802.11p communication at the blind corners. According to the experimental results, we observe that the minimum distance between the vehicle and the corner can effectively be represented as the key parameter in the model. Moreover, we have a variable parameter for adjusting the impact of the obstruction which could be different at each type of blind corners. The simulation results using our proposed model are compared with those using the existing obstacle model. The results showed that our proposed model is much more closely aligned with the real experimental results."
"Structural and functional brain imaging in acute HIV  2018 The AuthorsBackground: HIV RNA is identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within eight days of estimated viral exposure. Neurological findings and impaired neuropsychological testing performance are documented in a subset of individuals with acute HIV infection (AHI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether microstructural white matter and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) are disrupted in AHI. Methods: We examined 49 AHI (100% male; mean age = 30 ± SD 9.9) and 23 HIV-uninfected Thai participants (78% male; age = 30 ± 5.5) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and rsFC acquired at 3 Tesla, and four neuropsychological tests (summarized as NPZ-4). MRI for the AHI group was performed prior to combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) in 26 participants and on average two days (range:1–5) after ART in 23 participants. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI. Seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses were completed for the default mode (DMN), fronto-parietal, and salience and 6 subcortical networks. rsFC and DTI analyses were corrected for family-wise error, with voxelwise comparisons completed using t-tests. Group-specific voxelwise regressions were conducted to examine relationships between imaging indices, HIV disease variables, and treatment status. Results: The AHI group had a mean (SD) CD4 count of 421(234) cells/mm3 plasma HIV RNA of 6.07(1.1) log10 copies/mL and estimated duration of infection of 20(5.5) days. Differences between AHI and CO groups did not meet statistical significance for DTI metrics. Within the AHI group, voxelwise analyses revealed associations between brief exposure to ART and higher FA and lower RD and MD bilaterally in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (p < 0.05). Diffusion indices were unrelated to clinical variables or NPZ-4. The AHI group had reduced rsFC between left parahippocampal cortex (PHC) of the DMN and left middle frontal gyrus compared to CO (p < 0.002). Within AHI, ART status was unrelated to rsFC. However, higher CD4 cell count associated with increased rsFC for the right lateral parietal and PHC seeds in the DMN. Direct associations were noted between NPZ-4 correspond to higher rsFC of the bilateral caudate seed (p < 0.002). Conclusions: Study findings reveal minimal disruption to structural and functional brain integrity in the earliest stages of HIV. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if treatment with ART initiated in AHI is sufficient to prevent the evolution of brain dysfunction identified in chronically infected individuals."
"Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Inorganic Arsenic via Consumption of Herbs Collected in Thailand  2018 Nuntawat Monboonpitak et al.Total and inorganic arsenic contents in ten commonly consumed Thai herbs, namely, bird's eye chili, cayenne pepper, celery, garlic, holy basil, kitchen mint, lemongrass, pepper, shallot, and sweet basil, were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry coupled with a hydride generation system (HG-AAS). Total arsenic contents in fresh herbs and lyophilized herbs ranged from 3.39 to 119 ng/g wet weight (wet wt) and from 41.0 to 156 ng/g dry weight (dry wt), respectively. Inorganic arsenic contents in fresh herbs and lyophilized herbs ranged from 2.09 to 26.9 ng/g (wet wt) and from 23.5 to 55.5 ng/g (dry wt), respectively. Percentages of inorganic arsenic to total arsenic in herbs ranged from 22.7 to 62.0%. High percentages of inorganic arsenic to total arsenic were found in celery, lemongrass and sweet basil. Total arsenic contents in the studied herbs were lower than the maximum limits of Thai and Chinese regulatory standards, set at 2,000 ng/g in foods (excluding aquatic animals and seafood) and 500 ng/g in fresh vegetables, respectively. Total and inorganic arsenic contents in the studied herbs were comparable to or lower than the levels found in other studies in the EU and China. Lifetime average daily dose (LADD) and cancer risk (CR) of inorganic arsenic exposure to commonly consumed herbs were evaluated using probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) by @RISK software version 6.0 of Palisade cooperation. All calculated LADD and CR values from all herbs did not exceed the acceptable levels. It can be concluded that there were very low cancer risks of inorganic arsenic exposure from the consumption of the studied herbs."
"The synthesis, modification, and application of nanosilica in polymethyl methacrylate denture base  2018, Japanese Society for Dental Materials and Devices. All rights reserved.This study aimed to investigate amount of γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) silanized on experimental nanosilica particles (NPs), amount of NP and amount of MPS silanized NP on flexural strength (FS), flexural modulus (FM), and fracture toughness (FT) of NP reinforced polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The chemisorbed amount of MPS was determined using elemental analysis. Six groups (n=8) were prepared with chemisorbed amount and mixed with PMMA-monomer to make 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 15% (w/w) of NP reinforced PMMA. PMMA without NP served as control. Seven groups (n=8) were prepared with 1% of NP silanized with 0, 0.061, 0.123, 0.246, 0.493, 0.987, and 1.974 gMPS/gsilica and mixed with PMMA-monomer to make NP reinforced PMMA. FS, FM, and FT were determined using 3-point bending test. One-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons showed that 0.246 gMPS/gsilica of 1% amount of silanized NP group was significantly highest in FS, FM, and FT compared to the others (p<0.05)."
"Emulsion Cross-Linking Technique for Human Fibroblast Encapsulation  2018 Watcharaphong Chaemsawang et al.Microencapsulation with biodegradable polymers has potential application in drug and cell delivery systems and is currently used in probiotic delivery. In the present study, microcapsules of human fibroblast cells (CRL2522) were prepared by emulsion cross-linking technique.

"A curcumin-diglutaric acid conjugated prodrug with improved water solubility and antinociceptive properties compared to curcumin  2018 Japan society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and agrochemistry.In this work, a curcumin-diglutaric acid (CurDG) prodrug was synthesized by conjugation of curcumin with glutaric acid via an ester linkage. The water solubility, partition coefficient, release characteristics, and antinociceptive activity of CurDG were compared to those of curcumin. The aqueous solubility of CurDG (7.48 μg/mL) is significantly greater than that of curcumin (0.068 μg/mL). A study in human plasma showed that the CurDG completely releases curcumin within 2 h, suggesting the ability of CurDG to serve as a prodrug of curcumin. A hot plate test in mice showed the highest antinociceptive effect dose of curcumin at 200 mg/kg p.o., whereas CurDG showed the same effect at an effective dose of 100 mg/kg p.o., indicating that CurDG significantly enhanced the antinociceptive effect compared to curcumin. The enhanced antinociceptive effect of CurDG may be due to improved water solubility and increased oral bioavailability compared to curcumin."
"Prayoon Chanyawongse's Cartoon Likay: Amalgamating likay theatrical form and Comics into a Unique Thai Genre  2018 The Author(s).By launching in 1938 a series of adaptations of folktales in comics form, Thai cartoonist Prayoon Chanyawongse established the Cartoon Likay genre which places the reader as a member of an audience attending a Likay performance. The local theatrical form frames his graphic narratives where scenes of a play performed on a stage continuously alternate with sequences taking place in the vast realms of epics set in the Ayutthaya period. By introducing key Likay conventions such as recurring humorous interruptions and asides, Chanyawongse could effectively address contemporary social issues and political topics within traditional folktales. This paper explores several Cartoon Likay narratives in the context of the Likay theatrical form and the local folktale repertoire to discuss the nature and development of Chanyawongse's signature comics genre."
"A simplified superovulation protocol using splitsingle administration of Folltropin®-V in hyaluronan: Application to purebred sheep  2018 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.Superovulation is an important step in assisted reproductive technology. Due to its short half-life, follicle stimulating hormone is usually given twice daily to ewes for three to five days, which is both time- and labour-intensive. However, dissolving follicle stimulating hormone in degradable polymers to delay absorbtion has been effective in ruminants. Experiment 1 was performed to compare a split-single follicle stimulating hormone dissolved in hyaluronan (S group; 150 mg follicle stimulating hormone on the first day and 30 mg 48 h later; n = 21) and six decreasing doses of follicle stimulating hormone (M group; 50, 50, 30, 30, 10 and 10 mg; n = 22) at 12-h intervals. Ovarian responses and numbers of recovered ova/embryos did not differ significantly between groups. However, there tended to be more Grade 1 and 2 embryos in S vs M groups (mean ± SEM, 5.1 ± 4.9 vs 2.9 ± 2.9, respectively; P = 0.08). Experiment 2 tested the effectiveness of a simplified split-single follicle stimulating hormone in purebred sheep on a commercial farm. The numbers of recovered good-grade embryos (day 2) were 4.8 ± 5.0 and 4.0 ± 2.5 per donors in Corriedale and Bond sheep breeds, respectively. We conclude that this modified technique for ewe superovulation improved animal welfare, reduced animal handling and labour and yielded results similar to or better than conventional twice-daily follicle stimulating hormone treatments."
"Hepatic autotaxin overexpression in infants with biliary atresia  2018 Udomsinprasert et al.Background. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted glycoprotein that is involved in the development of hepatic fibrogenesis via the enzymatic production of lysophosphatidic acid. The aim of this study was to investigate hepatic expression of ATX in biliary atresia (BA) compared with non-BA liver controls and to examine the association betweenATX expression and clinical outcome in BA. Methods. Liver specimens from BA infants (nD20) were compared with samples from infants who underwent liver biopsy for reasons other than BA (nD14) and served as controls. RelativemRNAand protein expression ofATXwere quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Masson's Trichrome staining was performed to determine the degree of liver fibrosis. Results. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated overexpression of ATX mRNA in BA livers. In immunohistochemical evaluation, ATX was positively stained on the hepatic parenchyma and the biliary epithelium in BA patients, as compared to non-BA controls. The immunostaining score of ATX in BA livers was also significantly higher than that observed in non-BA livers (P < 0:001). Subgroup analysis revealed that ATX expression in the patients with poor outcomes was significantly greater than in those with good outcomes (P D0:03). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between hepatic ATX expression and Metavir fibrosis stage in BA livers (r D0:79, P < 0:001). Discussion. This study found thatmRNAand protein expression ofATXwere increased in BA livers. High hepatic ATX expression at the time of Kasai operation was associated with liver fibrosis and outcome in BA, suggesting that ATX may serve a role as a promising biomarker of the prognosis in biliary atresia."
"Integration of the Biorefinery Concept for Development of Sustainable Processes for the Pulp and Paper Industry  2018 Elsevier B.V.This work aims at developing sustainable processes for pulp and paper industry by integration of the biorefinery concept to an existing pulp and paper process. A systematic methodology employing a superstructure-based process synthesis approach is used with support from computer-aided tools to determine potential pathways for long-term sustainable growth. A superstructure of the multi-product biorefinery process network for the pulp and paper industry is developed. It is divided into three sub-networks, a chemical pulping section, a biochemical production section and a black liquor utilization section. Lignocellulosic biomass extracted from eucalyptus and bagasse is applied as feedstock for the network. Potential products from the biochemical production section include ethanol, lactic acid (LA) and succinic acid (SA) while those from black liquor utilization section include dimethyl ether (DME) and lignin apart from its conventional utilization as low-heating value energy for the pulp and paper process. Superstructure optimization is performed with the objective to maximize profit to determine optimal integrated networks for three scenarios. The obtained results provide useful insights for further development of optimal networks as sustainable integrated biorefinery combined with pulp and paper mills."
"Third party beneficiaries in Thai contract law  Pattarapas Tudsri and Angkanawadee Pinkaew, 2017.This chapter examines the ability for third party beneficiaries to enforce contracts under section 374 of the Thai Civil and Commercial Code. The provision illustrates that the urgency for enactment of the Code came at the expense of depth and intricacy. Whereas the German Civil Code expressly provides that the third party’s entitlement to enforce the provisions of a contract may be inferred from the circumstances, such provision is absent in the Thai Code. While the intention of the parties should be capable of inference from the contract, Thai courts have demonstrated a reluctance to read section 374 broadly; compelling evidence is required before the third party is found to acquire rights. Apart from the four categories of contracts where the courts more readily find third party rights-insurance, compromise, a contract to discharge a debt owed by third party, and a contract to confer an option on a third party-parties are likely to find it difficult to invoke section 374. Underlying the judicial attitude is the strong grip of the privity rule, or to use the German-inspired term, the ‘relativity of contract’. This restrictive approach also applies to the interpretation of ‘performance’ which does not include conferment of benefits."
"Formation of contract, enforceability, and pre-contractual liability in Thailand  Pattarapas Tudsri and Angkanawadee Pinkaew, 2017.This chapter examines issues concerning the formation of contract under Thai law. It discusses the background to the Thai Civil and Commercial Code 1925 and the French and German influences on its drafting. The chapter examines the interpretation of intention, which is integral to the notion of a juristic act for creation of contractual obligations. The direction to discern true intention, combined with notions of fictitious intention and concealed juristic act, enables a court to re-characterize transactions according to their true intention. Through the power to ‘transform a void act’, a court may also declare an act valid otherwise void for non-compliance with formalities governing one kind of juristic act, if it complies with the requirements of another juristic act. The chapter discusses the German concept of Vorvertrag or pre-contract in the context of transactions that do not comply with the formality requirements, and explains why the Thai judges have not embraced this concept. It also examines how a court imposes pre-contractual liability on a party breaking off from contract negotiations."
"Association between visual status and mental health status in thai rural elderly: A community-based study  2018, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office). All rights reserved.AIM: To evaluate the association between visual impairment (VI) and mental health or social engagement in older adults living in rural Thailand. METHODS: Data for this cross-sectional study were drawn from a community survey conducted in 2015 in Saraburi Province, Thailand. Participants were 327 adults aged ≥50y. VI was assessed using presenting distance visual acuity. Mental health and social engagement were evaluated in face-to-face interviews using validated questionnaires. After determining the prevalence of VI and relevant sociodemographic characteristics, multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of VI on mental health and social engagement. RESULTS: The prevalence of VI was 18.3%. Major causes were refractive error (58.3%) and cataract (35%). Factors associated with VI in the crude analysis were: older age [odds ratio (OR) 8.08], unemployment (OR 2.72), widowhood (OR 2.47), being divorced/separated (OR 3.27), smoking (OR 2.09) and disability in activities of daily living (OR 2.35). Protective factors were undergoing eye screening at least once a year (P=0.029) and obesity (P=0.005). VI was significantly associated with low social engagement (adjusted OR 4.13) but not with poor mental health (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Although VI older adults reported less participation in social activities, there is no significant association between VI and poor mental health. Annual eye examinations may prevent VI in older adults. Information about employment and anti-smoking should be targeted to older adults with VI."
"Investigation of sign language recognition performance by integration of multiple feature elements and classifiers  Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.Sign languages are used by healthy individuals when communicating with those who are hearing or speech impaired as well by those with hearing or speech impediments. It is quite difficult to acquire sign language skills since there are vast number of sign language words and some signing motions are very complex. Several attempts at machine translation have been investigated for a limited number of sign language motions by using KINECT and a data glove, which is equipped with a strain gauge to monitor the angles at which fingers are bent, to detect hand motions and hand shapes. One of the key features of our proposed method is using an optical camera and colored gloves for detection of sign language motion. The optical camera is implemented in a smartphone. This makes it possible to remove the limitation of using area and occasion as a machine translation tool. The authors propose two new schemes. One is to add the two feature elements, that is, hand direction obtained from the angle between the wrist and fingertips, and hand rotation calculated from the visible size of the palm and wrist incorporating the four conventional elements comprising motion trajectory, motion velocity, hand position and hand shape. The other is integrating the results which is obtained by each classifier to enhance the recognition performance. The six kinds of classifiers have been applied to 35 sign language motions. A total of 3150 pieces of motion data, that is, 2100 pieces of motion data as training data and 1050 pieces as evaluation data, were used to evaluate the proposed method. The recognition results were examined by integrating the feature elements and classifier. The success rate for 35 words was respectively 76.2% and 94.2%, for the selection of the first ranked answer, and the selection of the first, second or third ranked answers. These values suggest that the proposed method could be used as a review tool for assessing how well learner have mastered sign language motions."
"The application of modified marlstones in biofuel technology  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Nowadays, researchers have made attempts to seek for cost-effective and eco-friendly catalyst for transesterification reaction. One possible way to reduce the costs of the catalysts is to use biomass or industrial waste as catalytic materials. The use of waste materials as catalysts also reduces the cost of waste handling and disposal. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of the low cost, environmentally friendly calcined marlstones to be a viable catalyst in the transesterification of Jatropha seed oil. The calcination of marlstones was conducted at 900 °C for 4 h, and then the modification of calcined marlstones via hydration-dehydration treatment. The effects of different preparation conditions on biodiesel yield were investigated. The solid catalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The highest biodiesel yield of 97.56% for modified calcium oxide (CaO) catalyst was obtained under the optimum condition (reaction time 5 min, microwave power 600 W, methanol/oil molar ratio 9:1, and catalyst dosage 7 wt%). It was showing potential applications of novel catalyst in biodiesel industry."
"The fabrication of multicolor electrochromic device based on RGO/BOPP using ag nanoparticles  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.In this research, we focused on silver (Ag) nanoparticles that exhibit various colors on the basis of their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The effects of step-voltage parameters on the coloration of the Ag deposition-based electrochromic device were investigated. Further, we report the use of reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) as the transparent conductive electrode. RGO was synthesized directly from graphite under a microwave heating system. BOPP film was coated with RGO by drop-casting method. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electrical resistance measurements and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The SEM and TEM images exist as typical wrinkled structure, folded region, transparent, indicating these layers are exfoliated to a very large extent. Our results primarily indicate that the novel BOPP/RGO/Ag/RGO/BOPP configuration presents an easy and expeditious way of preparing the voltage-tunable multicolor electrochromic device. The electrochromic device can be switched from the transparent state to the black state and yellow state."
"Tai languages  2018 selection and editorial matter, Bernard Comrie; individual chapters, the contributors.Tai is the most widespread and best known subgroup of the Kra-Dai family (also known as Tai-Kadai or Kam-Tai). Map 38.1 shows the distribution of the Kra-Dai languages and Map 38.2 shows, in an approximate and oversimplifi ed way, the distribution of the Tai languages (the actual linguistic geography of Tai is very complex, with much overlapping and interpenetration of languages). Tai varieties are conventionally divided into the following groups: Southwestern, including Ahom (extinct), Khamti, Tai Nuea (Chinese Shan, Dehong Dai), Tai Long (Shan), Khuen, Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai), Kam Muang (Tai Yuan, Northern Thai), Thai (Siamese, Central Thai), Southern Thai, Lao (Lao dialects in Thailand are also called ‘Northeastern Thai’), White Tai, Tai Dam (Black Tai), Red Tai and several other languages which could not be shown in Map 38.2 for lack of space."

"Vignette: Error recognition: A so-called “writing” assessment?  2018 Taylor & Francis.English proficiency tests play an important role in Thailand as they judge the future of the test takers. Due to the cost of other internationally known tests, such as TOEFL or IELTS, many universities have developed in-house English tests, including the CU-TEP test from Chulalongkorn University. In this vignette, the authors share their stories and critique the CU-TEP written test portion, especially the error recognition format, as it does not reflect real-world writing tasks. The authors encourage test developers to redesign the test with performance-based writing assessment that could appropriately assess writing proficiency."
"Search for tth production in the all-jet final state in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV  2018, Springer Verlag. All rights reserved.A search is presented for the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top quark pair in the all-jet final state. Events√ containing seven or more jets are selected from a sample of proton-proton collisions at s = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. To separate the ttH signal from the irreducible tt + bb background, the analysis assigns leading order matrix element signal and background probability densities to each event. A likelihood-ratio statistic based on these probability densities is used to extract the signal. The results are provided in terms of an observed ttH signal strength relative to the standard model production cross section µ = σ/σSM, assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The best fit value is ˆµ = 0.9 ± 0.7(stat) ± 1.3(syst) = 0.9 ± 1.5 (tot), and the observed and expected upper limits are, respectively, µ < 3.8 and < 3.1 at 95% confidence levels."
"Alternative reverse osmosis to purify lactic acid from a fermentation brothAlternativna reverzna osmoza za prečišćavanje mlečne kiseline iz fermentacione komine  2018, CI and CEQ. All rights reserved.Brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) and seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes were used in a two-stage reverse osmosis (RO) unit to recover, pre-purify, and pre-concentrate lactic acid. Calcium lactate, sodium lactate, and ammonium lactate were used as model feed solutions. The operating pressure showed a pronounced effect on lactate passage through the first BWRO unit, and the Donnan exclusion effect and hydrogen bonding were responsible for cation rejection. Calcium ions were rejected at the BWRO unit because of low diffusion rate and charge interaction at the surface. However, monovalent ions formed hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group of the membrane that allowed passage across the membrane. The second SWRO unit was for pre-concentrating lactic acid. A high lactate purity of 99.2% with a total recovery of 50.5% was acquired from calcium lactate feed solution. Lower purity with higher lactate recovery was obtained when the feed solution was sodium lactate and ammonium lactate. When the actual fermentation broth was used in the two-stage RO unit, a slightly lower recovery and purity of lactic acid were obtained. It was claimed that the total ions present in the fermentation broth were responsible for the low efficiency of the two-stage RO unit."
"Factorial design analysis of parameters for the sorption-enhanced steam reforming of ethanol in a circulating fluidized bed riser using CFD  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.The sorption-enhanced steam reforming of ethanol (SESRE) has recently been reported as a novel process for hydrogen (H2) production. SESRE can operate well on a Ni-based catalyst with dolomite as a sorbent in packed-bed reactors. In this study, the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) concept was proposed to obtain higher productivity and continuous operation of SESRE. Particular focus was directed to the design and selection of suitable operating conditions of the CFB riser. Two-dimensional transient models using the Euler-Euler approach and the kinetic theory of granular flows were applied to investigate the H2 production performance from a pilot-scale riser. The 2k full factorial design method was utilized to examine the significances of five specific parameters, namely, the riser diameter, inlet temperature, catalyst-to-sorbent ratio, solid flux, and inlet gas velocity on two response variables, namely, H2 purity and H2 flux. From the ANOVA results, either the main effect or the interactions of each parameter were shown to be significant on both the H2 purity and the H2 flux, particularly the riser diameter and the solid flux. For optimizing the operation and reaction parameters, the best case was the system with riser diameter of 0.2 m, inlet temperature of 600 °C, catalyst-to-sorbent ratio of 2.54 kg kg-1, solid flux of 200 kg m-2 s-1, and gas velocity of 3 m s-1, obtaining H2 purity of 91.30% on a dry basis with a significantly high H2 flux of 0.147 kg m-2 s-1. The hydrodynamics showed that SESRE reached breakthrough within the bottom dense zone. However, incomplete conversion occurred in the core of the riser because of the very dilute bed."

"Starch consolidation of porous fused silica ceramics  2018 Chulalognkorn University.Starch consolidation is a forming technique, in which ceramic suspension is consolidated by gelatinization of starch under suitable temperature. This technique is promising for fabricating porous ceramics because starch can act as a binder as well as a pore former. In this study, porous fused silica ceramics were prepared by starch consolidation using glutinous rice flour as a gelling agent. The 29 vol% solid loading of fused silica slurries with the addition of glutinous rice flour were prepared. After mixing the slurries were poured into a plastic mold and kept in an oven at 75°C for an hour. The green samples were dried and sintered at a temperature range of 900-1300°C for an hour. Bulk density and compressive strength of the fused silica ceramics with 7 wt% glutinous rice flour sintered at 1150°C were 1.26 g/cm3 and 13.33 MPa, respectively. The phase of the sintered specimens remained amorphous with very low thermal expansion coefficient of 0.58 x 10-6°C-1."
"Ultrasound combined transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (UltraTENS) versus phonophoresis of piroxicam (PhP) in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: A randomized double-blind, controlled trial  2018-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.Background: Ultrasound combined with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (UltraTENS) and phonophoresis of piroxicam (PhP) are combined modality therapy that frequently used in musculoskeletal pain including knee osteoarthritis (OA). But it is lack of a good clinical trial to prove and compare their effects. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of UltraTENS with PhP on mild to moderate degree of symptomatic knee OA. METHODS: Sixty-one patients (55 women), mean age of 63.4 ± 8.1 y, 50-90 mm VAS of knee pain and Kellgren-Lawrence score of grade I-III were randomly allocated into UltraTENS and PhP (N = 31 and 30, respectively). The UltraTENS group received a combined ultrasound with TENS program and a non-drug gel, whereas the PhP group got an ultrasound program with piroxicam gel and sham TENS. All patients were treated for a total of 10 sessions, consisting of five times per week and 10 min per session. Before and after treatment, patients were evaluated knee pain by using the 100-mm VAS and functional performance by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index. RESULTS: The UltraTENS and PhP groups experienced considerable improvement in both VAS and total WOMAC scores post-treatment (P< 0.001). The PhP had better VAS of pain and WOMAC scores but no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that UltraTENS and PhP were effective for relieving pain and improve functionality knee OA without significant differences between their effects."
"A new benzophenone C-glucoside and other constituents of pseuduvaria fragrans and their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity  2018 by the authors.Phytochemical investigations of the leaves and stems of Pseuduvaria fragrans led to the isolation of a new benzophenone C-glucoside named pseuduvarioside (1), together with six known compounds including (−)-guaiol (2), (+)-isocorydine (3), cyathocaline (4), isoursoline (5), N-trans-coumaroyltyramine (6), and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (7). Their structures were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. All of the isolates were evaluated for inhibitory activity against the enzyme α-glucosidase. N-trans-coumaroyltyramine and N-trans-feruloyltyramine showed higher activity than the drug acarbose. Kinetic studies revealed that both tyramine-derived amides were uncompetitive inhibitors of the enzyme."
"Factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy of laser-scanning in vivo confocal microscopy for acanthamoeba keratitis Copyright  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Purpose: To determine the factors that influence the sensitivity and specificity of laser-scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) for diagnosing Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK). Methods: This retrospective, controlled study included 28 eyes of 27 patients with AK and 34 eyes of 34 patients with bacterial keratitis (as the control group). All patients had undergone corneal imaging with a laser-scanning IVCM (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph 3 with the Rostock Cornea Module). The IVCM images were independently evaluated by 2 experienced and 2 inexperienced masked observers. Sensitivity and specificity of IVCM for diagnosing AK and the effects of various clinical and imaging parameters on the sensitivity were then investigated. Results: Overall, IVCM had average sensitivity and specificity of 69.7% ± 2.5% and 97.1% ± 4.2% for experienced observers and 59.0% ± 7.6% and 92.7% ± 10.4% for inexperienced observers, respectively. However, the sensitivity did not show any significant association with the duration of disease, size of ulcer, depth of involvement, culture results, or cyst morphology. Although interobserver agreement was good (κ = 0.60, P < 0.001) for the experienced observers, it was only at a moderate level (κ = 0.48, P < 0.001) for the inexperienced observers. Conclusions: IVCM has a moderate sensitivity and a high specificity for diagnosis of AK. Although clinical parameters do not affect this diagnostic accuracy, a higher sensitivity is seen when images are interpreted by experienced observers."
"Continuous production of biodiesel from rubber seed oil using a packed bed reactor with BaCl2 impregnated CaO as catalyst Copyright  2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.The goal of this research was to test barium chloride (BaCl2) impregnated calcined razor clam shell as a solid catalyst for transesterification of rubber seed oil (RSO) in a packed bed reactor (PBR). The waste razor clam shells were crushed, ground, and calcined at 900°C in a furnace for 2 h to derive calcium oxide (CaO) particles. Subsequently, the calcined shells were impregnated with BaCl2 by wet impregnation method and recalcined at 300°C for 2 h. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, and basic strength measurements. The effects of various parameters such as residence time, reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio, and catalyst bed length on the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) were determined. The BaCl2/CaO catalyst exhibited much higher catalytic activity and stability than CaO catalyst influenced by the basicity of the doped catalyst. The maximum fatty acid methyl ester yield was 98.7 % under optimum conditions (residence time 2.0 h, reaction temperature 60°C, methanol/oil molar ratio 12:1, and catalyst bed length 200 mm). After 6 consecutive reactions without any treatment, fatty acid methyl ester yield reduced to 83.1 %. The option of using waste razor clam shell for the production of transesterification catalysts could have economic benefits to the aquaculture and food industries."
"Simulation of CO2 Geological Storage Together with a Water Alternating Gas Process for Oil Production in Fang Oilfield (Thailand)  2018 Elsevier B.V.Due to the environmental concern, carbon dioxide (CO2) emission into the atmosphere has been the main issue in petroleum industries. The sources of CO2 come from natural gas processing and other processes. The current technology to mitigate CO2 is carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCSU). However, oil is expected to produce more because of the higher consumption. Therefore, CO2 geological storage in depleting oilfield together with an enhanced oil recovery can be a better technology to meet both targets. The excellent example of this technology is the Weyburn Project in Canada that can store CO2 and produce more oil as well as prolong the reservoir life simultaneously. For this project, the technology is applied with the depleting oilfield for both oil production and CO2 storage in Northern Thailand by using simulation model with the real data of the oilfield. Water alternating gas (WAG) process for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is used to improve the mobility of the flooding system resulting in better sweep efficiency and an improvement in the oil recovery. Consequently, the objective of this research is to evaluate CO2 injection together with WAG process as well as to investigate the effects the parameters such as chasing water rate and total HCPV injection on oil production, CO2 consumption and sequestration. The total HCPV used in this study is ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 and the results are compared with that of CO2 flooding. From the simulation, the results report that oil can be produced up to 57% recovery, CO2 consumption is approximately 3 scf/bbl. Furthermore, CO2 consumption increases with total HCPV injection. The results of this study can be applied as a fundamental data to develop the CO2-EOR project in the depleting oilfield in the North of Thailand for both oil production and CO2 storage in the future."
"Experimental Study of a Biomass Downdraft Gasifier with Multi-tube Gas Outlets to Improve Synthesis Gases Quality  2018 Elsevier B.V.A downdraft gasifier is favored due to its easy fabrication and due to low tar content in the synthesis gas. This work presents a designed and experimental results of downdraft gasifier. The throat, the smallest cross-sectional area, is approximately 175 millimeters. The gasifier is divided into 2 pieces (top and bottom) for easy fabrication and cleaning of the internal parts. The top is a fuel chamber while the bottom is a reaction and ash chamber. This gasifier was made of carbon steel inserting multi-tube (12) carbon steel of 1 inch diameter to be outlets of synthesis gas. These tubes were returned back to drying and pyrolysis zones of the top chamber as a heat source to wood pellets. The gasification was carried out under atmospheric pressure with ambient air as gasifying agent. Experimental results showed that average volumetric percentage in the synthesis gas were 39.71 % CO, 16.48 % CO2, 36.26 % H2 and 7.55 % CH4. The gasification efficiency of this work of 40.47 % can be achieved."
"LCSoft as a Tool for LCA: New LCIA Methodologies and Interpretation  2018 Elsevier B.V.Life Cycle Assessment or LCA is a technique to evaluate and analyse environmental impacts through the entire life cycle of products and its associated processes.

ReCiPe, including midpoint and endpoint impacts, is added into LCIA method selection, water scarcity footprint and ecological footprint are added as a new feature of interpretation. Also, LCSoft can estimate water scarcity footprint and ecological footprint in different countries and periods of time. Finally, LCA calculations for bioethanol production from cassava rhizome and a carbon dioxide conversion process are validated by comparing with SimaPro, which is another LCA software. The results show that the new LCIA methodologies and LCA interpretation of LCSoft has the ability to evaluate environmental impacts of biochemical and petrochemical processes."
"Simulation/optimization of bio-hydrogenated diesel process with techno-economic analysis  2018 Elsevier B.V.In this study, Pro II and general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software were applied to synthesize and optimize the Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) process. This research had been divided into three main parts. The first part was focused on conceptual process simulation of BHD process. The operating condition analysis method represented operating parameters at 325oC, 500 psig with NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The final commercial products were n-hexadecane and n-octadecane. The input information such as reaction conditions, conversion of each reaction, production yield and products purity were provided by petrochemical industry in Thailand. The second part was concentrated on process improvement in energy efficiency by mathematical programming which was used for designing heat exchanger network (HEN) or heat integration of the process. It decreased operating cost and saved hot and cold utility usages. In final part, techno economic analysis was a key factor that played an important role on investment decision by using economic parameters of net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PBP). The BHD plant capacity was 10,000 Liters/day which used palm oil as feedstock. The energy consumption was optimized by HEN designed by GAMS programing. The simulation result showed the production rate was 12,374.09 Liters/day, the conversion of biodiesel range was 99.83%, and product yield and purity of commercial product were 79.89 and 99.92% respectively. BHD process required 7 heat exchangers resulting in the reduction of energy consumption on heater from 1,335,233 kJ/h to 655,905 kJ/h or heating utility was saved about 50%. Moreover, BHD process made profit over 45.67 million Baht with PBP of 9.4 years and IRR at 25.40%."
"Effect of antioxidant-containing edible coating on stability of banana conserve stick  2018 Chiriotti Editori. All rights reserved.The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of agar coating fortified with antioxidant on physical and chemical stability of banana conserve stick. Agar coating containing 0-200 ppm of tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) was applied to banana conserve stick and quality changes of the sample were monitored during 5-week storage as compared to conserve stick wrapped with cellophane sheet and the unwrapped/uncoated control. Upon storage, the control exhibited the greatest increase in moisture content (35.0% wb at Week 0 vs. 38.6% wb at Week 3). Water activity (aw), on the other hand, did not change significantly (p>0.05), with all samples exhibiting aw within the range of 0.80-0.86. Regarding texture, the control demonstrated a decrease in hardness over time and this was significantly lower than the wrapped or coated samples (p≤0.05). In terms of appearance, coating and wrapping seemed to pose a minimal effect on CIE L∗, a∗ and b∗ of the conserve stick. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) content was determined in order to monitor lipid oxidation in the conserve samples. The control demonstrated the greatest TBARs value (1.3 μg/g at Week 5) while those samples with TBHQ-added coating showed a slower increase in TBARs. A decrease in lipid oxidation was noticed upon increasing TBHQ concentration (0.9 μg/g at Week 5 for the sample with 200 ppm TBHQ). From this study, edible agar coating was shown to be effective in retarding moisture uptake of banana conserve stick. Addition of TBHQ to the coating further increased oxidative stability of the sample. Active edible coating can thus be used to impose storage stability of conserve stick."
"Improvement of Synergistic Extraction of Neodymium Ions via Robust Model Predictive Control  2018 Elsevier B.V.A neodymium, a high value rare earth element (REE), is widely used as a rare earth magnet. Neodymium magnets (also known as NdFeB) are permanent magnets made of neodymium, iron and boron alloy. These magnets used in several products require low magnet mass or strong magnetic fields such as microphones, in-ear headphones, and computer hard disks. As neodymium is a precious metal, high purity separation of neodymium from low concentrate is required. A hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) is a viable technique for metal extraction at very low concentration because it has a larger mass transfer per unit surface area, high selectivity property, and low energy consumption. Moreover, the HFSLM consumes lower amount of extractant solution than conventional solvent extraction methods. This research is aimed at studying the extraction of neodymium ions Nd(III) through the HFSLM by mean of synergistic extraction systems to increase in extraction efficiency. The separation of Nd(III) in nitric solution is carried out by 0.5 M of di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and 0.5 M of trioctyl phoshine oxide (TOPO) in the liquid membrane, and 1 M of sulfuric acid in the stripping solution. To achieve good separation of the Nd(III) throughout the continuous process, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique is applied to control the concentration of extracted neodymium at a desired set point by manipulating the flow rate of feed solution and its control performance is compared with that of a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller. Simulation study has shown that the optimum extraction of 94.5 % can be achieved and the MPC and PID controllers can control the concentration of neodymium ions at the desired set point. However, the MPC provides better control responses than the PID controller does in both nominal and parameter mismatch cases."
"Optimization of Cryogenic Carbon Capture and LNG process by Mathematical programming  2018 Elsevier B.V.Cryogenic processes are industrial processes of sub-ambient or low temperature, used for freezing or liquefaction of gas. The cryogenic condition is done by the refrigeration system with compressors and condensers consuming high operating costs of shaft work, and condenser duty, therefore mathematical programming; GAMS, is applied as a tool to optimize the energy efficiency of the refrigeration system. In this work, cryogenic carbon capture and LNG processes (Fazlollahi, 2015) was applied as a base case for improving energy efficiency by reducing shaft work and energy duty at compressors and condensers. The concept of energy-optimization model was from Non-Linear Programming model (NLP) (Colmenares and Seider, 1989). The base-case process was simulated by software Aspen plus V8.8. Representing economic change, scenarios of different operating costs were applied. Two energy-optimization models of simple and cascade refrigeration systems; under two scenarios of shaft-work cost dominance and condenser-duty cost dominance, were developed. Under shaft-work cost dominance, the simple-refrigeration model saved 72.68% and 56.12 % in shaft-work and condenser-duty costs, respectively, compared to the base case. Cascade-refrigeration model saved 48.53% and 64.77 % in shaft-work and condenser-duty costs, respectively. Under condenser-cost dominance, the simple refrigeration model saved 65.12 % and 57.73 % in shaft-work and condenser-duty costs, respectively. Cascade refrigeration model saved 8.12 % and 62.1 % in shaft-work and condenser-duty costs, respectively. As a result, cascade refrigeration model gave lower condenser-duty cost in both scenarios. However, the cascade refrigeration model had constraints to prevent negative temperature approach in condensers and constraints not to allow shaft work at compressors reach the lowest value. Simple refrigeration model gave a better design solution for only shaft-work reduction. However, cascade refrigeration model gave higher energy efficiency for both condenser-duty and shaft-work costs reductions."
"Energy and exergy analysis for cryogenic process design/retrofit  2018 Elsevier B.V.While the oil price has been decreasing dramatically, downstream petrochemical industries using by-products from upstream process such as methane, ethane, and others are still growing due to demand of domestic products e.g., plastic and resin. The downstream process like LNG production or Gas separation processes needs refrigeration system for cooling the natural gas to reach the proper condition which requires high energy consumption of compressor work, evaporator and condenser. To gain more benefit, reduction of utilities are the main goal. For this purpose, exergy analysis has been applied with pinch analysis called Extended Pinch Analysis and Design (ExPAnD) (Aspelund et al., 2007) to reduce that work by adjusting the pressure and temperature. Besides that, graphical and mathematical models have been used to identify efficient condition by using the exergetic temperature concept (Marmolejo-Correa et al., 2012) which is the energy quality parameter. This parameter can be used to conduct the TET −E.Tdiagram (Exergetic composite curves) defining the utility consumption that should be reduced by exergy target."
"Compact and Multi-Stream Heat Exchanger Design  2018 Elsevier B.V.Energy recovery has been playing a major role in most of chemical industries and related fields. A conventional heat recovery system or heat exchanger network (HEN) is usually composed of lots of exchangers. This may lead to extra costs in operation and construction. Thus, this work focuses on designing, optimizing, and applying multi-stream plate-fin heat exchangers (PFHEs) into a HEN to reduce a number of exchangers and costs. The process of doing so starts with synthesis of a conventional HEN. The process stream data used as the case study in this work is taken from a gas separation plant in Thailand. Such network is recognized as the based case which will be improved by replacing some exchangers with PFHEs. The improved network is recognized as the improved case which provides less annual cost than the conventional one around 3 times."
"Probiotic encapsulation by spray drying using konjac glucomannan hydrolysate as wall material and its application in ice cream  2018 Chiriotti Editori. All rights reserved.This research aims to study encapsulation efficiency of cell probiotics by using Konjac glucomannan hydrolysate (KGMH) under spray drying. KGMH was prepared from Konjac glucomannan solution (KGMS) at different concentrations. Lactobacillus casei was used in this study as it is commonly used in food industry and resistance to heat. The effect of wall material (HGMH) concentration on encapsulation efficiency of the cell probiotic was evaluated. Probiotics culture was prepared by inoculating in sterile MRS broth and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours, the cells were harvested in the early stationary phase. Konjac glucomannan solution was hydrolysed by mannanase at 40°C for 4 hours. Then, probiotic solution (10 log CFU/ml) was mixed with KGMH at concentration of 15%, 20% and 25% (w/w). Spray drying condition was kept at constant inlet air temperature of 170°C, outlet air temperature of 85°C and feed flow rate of 10 mL min-l. Encapsulated probiotic with KGMH at concentration of 25% (w/w) exhibited the highest encapsulation efficiency (95.4 %), water activity of 0.198 and moisture content of 4.38 % (w.b.). For application in ice cream, microcapsules of probiotic encapsulated with KGMH at concentration of 25% with and without 10% (w/w) trehalose were then mixed into milk ice cream separately. The ice cream was stored at -18°C for one month. The survival rate of microencapsulated probiotic cells and free cells probiotics in the ice cream were measured. It was found that microcapsule of KGMH at concentration of 25% (w/w) with 10% (w/w) trehalose gave higher survival rate of probiotics cell (> 90%) in ice cream under freezing temperature than KGMH at concentration of 25% (w/w) and free cell probiotics during storage, respectively."
"The impact of perceived counterfeit luxury brand proliferation on luxury brand values and patronage intention  2018 University of Zagreb a. All rights reserved.Purpose - The purpose of this research is to explore the impact of perceived counterfeit proliferation (PCP) on fi ve luxury brand values of an original luxury fashion brand. This research also explores the correlations between luxury brand values and patronage intention. Design/Methodology/Approach - Two hundred and twenty survey questionnaires were collected, and the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLSSEM) technique was used to analyze data. Findings and implications - The results indicated that PCP has a statistically signifi cant impact on uniqueness value only, while quality, hedonic, conspicuous, and extended- self values are not aff ected for Southeast Asian consumers. This suggests that a proliferation of counterfeit luxury brands cannot be viewed in the same way as authentic luxury brand proliferation, which tend to have negative impacts on other brand values apart from uniqueness value. On the other hand, the luxury brand values that have signifi cant statistical relationships with patronage intention are quality, hedonic, and extended- self values, suggesting that Southeast Asian consum- ers mainly base their patronage intention on personal motives rather than on interpersonal motives. Limitations - The only luxury fashion brand studied in this study is Louis Vuitton, which could limit the generalizability of results. Also, the eff ect of cultural diff erence was not explored. It is advisable for future research to explore the moderating eff ects of culture. Originality - To the best of our knowledge, this research is one of only a few to quantitatively study the eff ects of PCP on the fi ve dimensions of luxury brand values."
"Development of paper-based analytical devices for minimizing the viscosity effect in human saliva  Ivyspring International Publisher.Rationale: Saliva as a sample matrix is rapidly gaining interest for disease diagnosis and point-of-care assays because it is easy to collect (non-invasive) and contains many health-related biomarkers. However, saliva poses particular problems relative to more common urine and blood matrices, which includes low analyte concentrations, lack of understanding of biomolecule transportation and inherent viscosity variability in human samples. While several studies have sought to improve assay sensitivity, few have addressed sample viscosity specifically. The goal of this study is to minimize the effect of sample viscosity on paper-based analytical devices (PADs) for the measurement of pH and nitrite in human saliva. Methods: PADs were used to measure salivary pH from 5.0 to 10.0 with a universal indicator consisting of chlorophenol red, phenol red and phenolphthalein. Nitrite determination was performed using the Griess reaction. Artificial saliva with viscosity values between 1.54 and 5.10 mPa·s was tested on the proposed PAD. To ensure the proposed PADs can be tailored for use in-field analysis, the devices were shipped to Australia and tested with human specimens. Results: Initial experiments showed that viscosity had a significant impact on the calibration curve for nitrite; however, a more consistent curve could be generated when buffer was added after the sample, irrespective of sample viscosity. The linear range for nitrite detection was 0.1 to 2.4 mg/dL using the improved method. The nitrite measurement in artificial saliva also showed a good correlation with the standard spectrophotometry method (p=0.8484, paired sample t-test, n=20). Measured pH values from samples with varying viscosities correlated well with the results from our pH meter. Conclusions: The inherent variation of salivary viscosity that impacts nitrite and pH results can be addressed using a simple washing step on the PAD without the need for complex procedures."

All rights reserved.Change orders lead to the modification of construction works, which has a direct impact on various aspects of construction projects, including scope, budget, and schedule. The traditional change order process involves the production and communication of a significant amount of information, usually in the form of paper-based documents that are mostly narrative and not well organized. It is therefore difficult for all project participants to understand the physical changes to the construction work and identify the information necessary for determining the resulting time and cost impacts. These challenges point to the need for an integrated decision support system that can assist project stakeholders to visualize the physical alterations, to manage the pertinent information, to perform quantity takeoff, and to assess the impacts of construction changes, all of which can be facilitated by building information modeling (BIM). This paper develops a BIM-based system that can be used to evaluate the impacts of construction change orders. The proposed system focuses on quantifying three major impacts of change orders in construction projects, namely, physical conditions, schedule, and budget. The system architecture and integration of several BIM-enabled tools, including Autodesk Revit, Dynamo, Microsoft Excel, and VBA are presented. Given a particular construction change order, the system automatically detects the altered building elements and evaluates the schedule and cost impacts of the proposed change. This system can assist all project participants in visualizing and quantifying the impacts of construction change. It can also enhance the accuracy of time-cost impact evaluations as well as facilitate the overall change management process."
"Study of optimum condition for rapid preparation of thrombin using russell’s viper venom factor X activator  2018 Kijkriengkraikul and Nuchprayoon.Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate a simple method with the optimum condition for rapid thrombin preparation from Cryoprecipitate-depleted Plasma (CDP) using RVV-X in the process. Methods: Thrombin preparation from human CDP was studied with the presence of different factors in batch condition including: 1) RVV-X; 2) volume of calcium chloride solution; 3) volume of sodium chloride solution for final extraction; and 4) incubation time. The properties of the prepared sample were analyzed for fibrin clot formation, total protein by Kjeldahl method, thrombin time, molecular weight and protein patterns by SDS-PAGE, and thrombin concentration by coagulation analyzer. The method and process of preparing thrombin and the study of optimum condition for rapidly preparing the highest yield of thrombin from starting CDP 100 ml were introduced. Results: The best four conditions were concluded: 1) RVV-X 50 mcg should be present in the process; 2) volume of 0.25 M calcium chloride should be 3 ml; 3) volume of 0.85% sodium chloride for the final protein precipitate extraction should be 10 ml and; 4) no incubation time needed for prothrombin activation process. A solution prepared from the optimum condition showed an obvious band on SDS-PAGE at a molecular weight about 36,000 Da which is our target protein thrombin. The prepared solution had a total protein content of 0.065 g/dl and gave satisfactory results of thrombin time (9 seconds) and fibrin clot formation. The test results of thrombin concentration between the method with and without incubation time were 269.4 and 295.2 IU/ml, respectively. Conclusion: This result showed that the method with RVV-X but without incubation time for prothrombin activation (optimum condition) gave the highest yield of thrombin."

"The Transition Probabilities from Captive Animal’s Behavior by Non-invasive Sensing Method Using Stochastic Multilevel State Model  2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.This article proposes a stochastic multilevel-state framework to model the animal’s behavior. The motivation of this article is the variety behavior influenced by several factors, which can lead to the state explosion. The proposed framework processes data from an automated sensing system and constructs the model. The data gathered from captive Antelope goral (Naemorhedusgriseus) in Chiang Mai Night Safari, Thailand. The data is gathered from the activity and the environmental factors in the cage by none invasive method. The model separated observed data into two main classes: the upper-level data and the lower-level data. The upper-level data represents the environment data such as temperature, humidity, and light density. Moreover, the landscape of the captivity area also takes into consideration. On the other hand, the lower-level represents the location of the animal of interested in the captivity area. The working strategy of this work is to cluster the each type of data and link them together by a stochastic approach. Both layers of data will be handled independently in clustering algorithm and determine probabilistic of state transaction. From the data observed from the sensor, the Probabilistic Automaton (PA) function is constructed. It is a function of producing the next stage based on the previous behavior states. The initial state of the framework is in the lower-level data (the current location of the animal). Then, the PA using the current lower stage and the current upper stage generates the next stage, location of the animal. Both the lower stage and the upper stage are traverse along the constructed automaton. The result can suggest computing methods, which can utilize to zoo research, which performs behavior monitoring, and in the other studies area, or subject of study, such as, air pollution dispersion that tracks the movement of pollutant according to the environment. The benefits of the proposed methods also can be used to create the application to attract the tourist to the area, which animally is likely to display themselves."
"Cyanobacterial UV sunscreen: Biosynthesis, regulation, and application  2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.Cyanobacteria are the photosynthetic prokaryotes that exist in diverse habitats on the Earth. Cyanobacteria are the major groups of photosynthetic organisms often exposed to visible and UV radiations (UVR) in their natural habitats. UVR has detrimental effects on their physiological and biochemical life processes. Therefore, they have evolved diverse responses for UV protection at the molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. Most response mechanisms include avoidance by migration to lower UVR conditions, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by UV exposure, screening by certain UV-absorbing compounds (UV sunscreens), and repair and resynthesis of macromolecules such as damaged DNA and proteins. It has been well documented that the effective UV sunscreens serve a crucial role in protection from UVR. In this chapter, we focus on the occurrence of natural UV sunscreens in cyanobacteria, such as mycosporine-like amino acids and scytonemin. Carotenoids and their glycosides are also thought to play an important role in UV light protection in cyanobacteria. We describe our current understandings of these cyanobacterial secondary metabolites, and place special emphasis on their biosynthetic pathways, regulations, and cellular functions. The future prospects of their applications are also discussed."
"The development of a mobile map application for park and ride users  2018, Int. J. of GEOMATE.User-centered design (UCD) has long been employed to enhance various map-based applications and GIS tools to ensure effective user interfaces. However, existing UCD guidelines cannot cover all relevant aspects, so the design process is becoming difficult; for example, a button should be located on the first page or not. This article presents the development of a mobile map application for park and rides users with user-centered design combined with the user experience. A brainstorming session was conducted gathering mobile application designers, programmer and commuters to generate ideas as to how people would use the application and how they would feel when using the application or user experience. All user experience findings were recorded with user journey. Several important aspects, such as a sequence of users' activities and information needed, were identified when user experience was considered during the design process. Additional features (e.g. reward points) were added at an appropriate place to enhance user engagement. The user journey helped me better organize functions, information, and the sequence of the mobile application."
"Combination of inclusive and differential tt¯ charge asymmetry measurements using ATLAS and CMS data at √s = 7 and 8 TeV  CERN, for the benefit of the ATLAS-CMS Collaboration.This paper presents combinations of inclusive and differential measurements of the charge asymmetry (AC) in top quark pair (tt) events with a lepton+jets signature by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, using data from LHC proton-proton collisions at centreof- mass energies of 7 and 8TeV. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of about 5 and 20 fb–1for each experiment, respectively. The resulting combined LHC measurements of the inclusive charge asymmetry are AC LHC7= 0:005±0:007 (stat) ±0:006 (syst) at 7TeV and AC LHC7= 0:0055 ± 0:0023 (stat) ± 0:0025 (syst) at 8TeV. These values, as well as the combination of AC measurements as a function of the invariant mass of the [formula presented] system at 8TeV, are consistent with the respective standard model predictions."
"Prevalence of diabetes and relationship with socioeconomic status in the Thai population: National health examination survey, 2004?2014  2018 Wichai Aekplakorn et al.Objective. To determine the prevalence and trend of diabetes, related glycemic control, and influential socioeconomic (SES) factors in the Thai population aged =20 years during 2004?2014. Methods. Data from the Thai National Health Examination Survey 2004, 2009, and 2014 were used. Age-adjusted prevalence was calculated, and the associations of education levels with prevalence of diabetes and glycemic control were examined using logistic regression. Results. Age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes increased from 7.7% in 2004 to 7.8% in 2009 and 9.9% in 2014 (8.9% among men and 10.8% among women). Proportions of undiagnosed diabetes were slightly decreased but remained high in 2014 (51.2% for men and 41.3% for women). Diabetes prevalence was higher among those with primary education in both sexes; however, undiagnosed diabetes was higher among women with secondary and university educations. The percentages of those treated and controlled slightly improved among men (45.9%) but not among women (36.4%). Unmet glycemic control was also higher among women with secondary education levels and among men with university-level educations. Conclusions. Epidemic diabetes continues to grow in the Thai population, particularly in individuals with lower educational attainment. Measures to detect new cases and strengthen glycemic control should be scaled up."
"ASEAN-India connectivity: Progress so far  2018 ASEAN-India Centre (AIC), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS); ASEAN Studies Centre (ASC), Chulalongkorn University and KW Publishers Pvt Ltd.Introduction Southeast Asia and India share a strong civilizational link, which dates back to history. The cultural and historical ties happened through inter-regional exchanges of people, trade, language and culture, which contributed to the richness and development of India and Southeast Asia. Such exchanges in the past made our borders not only meaningless but also provided a solid foundation for today’s contemporary relations. From this perspective, both Southeast Asia and India are regionally integrated and also globally connected."
"Introduction  2018 ASEAN-India Centre (AIC), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS); ASEAN Studies Centre (ASC), Chulalongkorn University and KW Publishers Pvt Ltd.India and Southeast Asian countries are striving for greater regional integration. Despite geographical proximity and cultural affinity, trade and investment between ASEAN and India are substantially lower than the potential. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in goods, implemented in 2010, and the services trade and investment agreement in 2015 between ASEAN and India represent an important effort to enhance regional integration. While ASEAN and India are celebrating the third decade of partnership, the relationship of both partners is not a merely recent product. They have indeed a long experience of interactions, an association made of exchanges, and peaceful interactive influences. India shares both land and maritime boundaries with ASEAN. Civilisational and cultural links between India and the Southeast Asia date back thousands of years. Probably no other country has such strong links with the Southeast Asia region as much as India by way of religion, language, culture and civilisation. People in Southeast Asia, by nature, seem to enjoy and treasure the feelings of this closeness. India is perceived by Southeast Asian countries as a benevolent power. Despite deep and structural influence of India on Southeast Asia, the region has nevertheless been able to transform into its own version of Indianisation as it is rooted in the constructive and rich landscape and melting pot of culture and history."

"Asean attempts at the initiatives to broaden free trade agreements in East Asia  2018 ASEAN-India Centre (AIC), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS); ASEAN Studies Centre (ASC), Chulalongkorn University and KW Publishers Pvt Ltd.ASEAN’s notable presence in the regional arena can evidently be discerned from its dynamic trade development and integration policy as well as from a number of enterprising collaborative efforts of trading arrangements in East Asia. In the early 1990s, ASEAN initiated its own trading area, know'll to many as ASEAN Free Trade Area (or AFTA), which was then extended to be the ASEAN Economic Community by the end of the following decade. ASEAN’s own initiative like AFTA had given the attention to its dialogue partners for a better part. Many of the ASEAN members had been able to solve their problems resulting from the last Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, thus came the new era of ASEAN’s trade development and integration with outsiders, since the early part of the new century. Since then. ASEAN members, individually and as a grouping, have embarked upon multiple bilateral, regional and sub-regional initiatives for the flourishing pursuit of trading arrangements, often known as free trade agreements (FTAs) or sometimes as comprehensive economic partnership agreements (CEPAs)."
"Celebrating the third decade and beyond: New challenges to ASEAN-India economic partnership  2018 ASEAN-India Centre (AIC), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS); ASEAN Studies Centre (ASC), Chulalongkorn University and KW Publishers Pvt Ltd.The ASEAN-India economic integration has made substantial progress in recent years. India’s engagements with Southeast and East Asia have received new momentum under the Act East Policy (AEP). In 2017, ASEAN and India will be celebrating 25 years of their dialogue relations. The relationship is set to deepen in coming days as ASEAN and India step up their collaboration across a range of economic and strategic issues, including trade and connectivity, culture, people-to-people links, trans-national terrorism, and maritime security. However, both of them have been facing several challenges which call for concerted efforts by ASEAN and India. With ASEAN and India working towards establishing a Comprehensive Free Trade Area through Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, their cooperation will be key in promoting economic stability, competitiveness, growth and integration in the region. This book is a timely initiative to review the past and suggest the ways to further strengthen the economic partnership. It primarily deals with the economic integration issues between ASEAN and India, and assesses policy priorities, effectiveness, implementation imperatives and challenges. Each chapter in this book tries to capture essential features of the crosscutting issues and attempts to draw some policy implications. It will be a valuable reference for policymakers, academics and practitioners."
"Characterization and optimization of thermally grown iridium oxide and its application to pH sensors  MYU K.K.In this study, we evaluate the thermal oxidization methods of iridium to simplify the fabrication of Ir/IrOx pH microsensors. Iridium oxide (IrOx) is a typical pH-sensing material. Specifically, three parameters of the previously reported ""carbonate-melt"" method are modified, namely, the oxidization temperature, oxidization time, and annealing process after oxidization. Then, we compare the characteristics of the fabricated sensors (i.e., the initial pH responsivity, time required to reach the steady state, and potential drift). The pH response depends on oxidization temperature and time."
"Non-redox lipoxygenase inhibitors from nauclea orientalis  2018 Natural Product Incorporation. All Rights Reserved.Eight alkaloids recently isolated from the roots of Nauclea orientalis (L.) L. were obtained to evaluate the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory activity. According to the LOX inhibitory assay, the cis isomer 1 (IC50 39.2±1.1 µM) was more potent than the trans isomer 2 (IC50 52.1±1.5 µM) (P < 0.05). Compound 5 (IC50 57.8±1.8 µM) was more potent than 6 (IC50 97.6±3.4 µM), 3 (IC50 112.1±2.6 µM) and 4 (inactive) (P <0.05), respectively. Alkaloid glycosides 7 and 8 were completely inactive in a screening assay. All active indole alkaloids were inactive in DPPH and 13-HPOD scavenging assays at the concentration of 100 µM. Moreover, these compounds did not exhibit the interferential effects on the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox state as indicated by the iron reduction and oxidation assays. The enzyme kinetic study revealed that 1, 2 and 6 inhibited sb-LOX-1 through the mixed inhibition with a set of inhibition constants (K and K) of 9 and 22, 17 and 46, and 16 and 32 µM, respectively. Indole alkaloids 3 and 5 were the uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibitors with the K of 24 and 8 µM. These findings undoubtedly demonstrated that these active indole alkaloids were non-redox lipoxygenase inhibitors."
"A synbiotic mixture of scGOS/lcFOS and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V increases faecal Bifidobacterium in healthy young children  2018 Wageningen Academic Publishers. Little is known about the impact of nutrition on toddler gut microbiota. The plasticity of the toddler gut microbiota indicates that nutritional modulation beyond infancy could potentially impact its maturation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of consuming Young Child Formula (YCF) supplemented with short chain galactooligosaccharides and long chain fructooligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS, ratio 9:1) and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V on the development of the faecal microbiota in healthy toddlers. A cohort of 129 Thai children aged 1-3 years were included in a randomised controlled clinical study. The children were assigned to receive either YCF with 0.95 g/100 ml of scGOS/lcFOS and 1.8×10 7 cfu/g of B. breve M-16V (Active-YCF) or Control-YCF for 12 weeks. The composition and metabolic activity of the faecal microbiota, and the level of secretory immunoglobulin A were determined in the stool samples. The consumption of Active-YCF increased the proportion of Bifidobacterium (mean 27.3% at baseline to 33.3%, at week 12, P=0.012) with a difference in change from baseline at week 12 between the Active and Control of 7.48% (P=0.030). The consumption of Active-YCF was accompanied with a more acidic intestinal milieu compared to the Control-YCF. The pH value decreased statistically significantly in the Active-YCF group from a median of 7.05 at baseline to 6.79 at week 12 (P < 0.001). The consumption of Active-YCF was associated with a softer pudding-like stool consistency compared to the Control-YCF. At week 6 and week 12, the betweengroup difference in stool consistency was statistically significant (P=0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). A Young Child Formula supplemented with scGOS/lcFOS and B. breve M-16V positively influences the development of the faecal microbiota in healthy toddlers by supporting higher levels of Bifidobacterium. The synbiotic supplementation is also accompanied with a more acidic intestinal milieu and softer stools."
"A solvatochromic-based sensor for chromium(iii) in real systems  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.A very simple, highly sensitive and selective method for the determination of trace amounts of Cr3+ in real systems using the solvatochromic properties of a rhodamine-based sensor has been developed. This solvatochromic-based sensor is established using commercially available rhodamine dissolved in different solvents to produce rhodamine lactone (RhoL) via the rhodamine lactone-zwitterion equilibrium. Complexation studies using fluorescence spectroscopy showed that RhoL exhibited the highest colorimetric and fluorescence selectivity and sensitivity to Cr3+ in aqueous medium when compared to other metal ions. Importantly, RhoL could directly and rapidly detect Cr3+ through filter paper without resorting to additional instrumental analysis."
"Correlation between the potency of flavonoids on mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity and melanin synthesis in melanocytes  2018 by the authors.Twenty-seven flavonoids isolated from Dalbergia parviflora with vast structural diversity were screened for inhibitory activity against mushroom and murine tyrosinases using L-DOPA as the substrate. Among the flavonoids tested, only four—khrinone (5), cajanin (9), (3RS)-3-hydroxy-8-methoxy vestitol (21), and (6aR,11aR)-3,8-dihydroxy-9-methoxy pterocarpan (27)—reacted with mushroom tyrosinase, with IC50 values of 54.0, 67.9, 67.8, and 16.7 µM, respectively, and only compound 27 showed inhibitory activity against murine tyrosinase. With cell-based assays, only compounds 9 and 27 effectively inhibited melanogenesis in B16-F10 melanoma cells (by 34% and 59%, respectively), at a concentration of 15 µM, without being significantly toxic to the cells. However, the crude extract of D. parviflora and some of the flavonoid constituents appeared to increase melanin production in B16-F10 cells, suggesting that there are flavonoids with both inhibitory and stimulatory melanogenesis in the crude extract. Studies on the correlation between the enzyme-based and cell-based assays showed that only the flavonoids with IC50 values below 50 µM against mushroom tyrosinase could inhibit the mammalian tyrosinase, and thus, reduce melanogenesis in B16-F10. Flavonoids with the IC50 values greater than 50 µM, on the other hand, could not inhibit the mammalian tyrosinase, and had either no effect or enhancement of melanogenesis. In conclusion, the tyrosinase enzyme from mushroom is not as selective as the one from mammalian source for the enzyme-based melanogenesis inhibitory screening, and the mammalian cell-based assay appears to be a more reliable model for screening than the enzyme-based one."
"Effects of different sulfuric acid etching concentrations on PEEK surface bonding to resin composite  2018, Japanese Society for Dental Materials and Devices. All rights reserved.This study evaluated the effects of surface pretreatment with different concentrations of sulfuric acid etching on surface properties and bonding between Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and a resin composite. Six groups of surface pretreatment (no pretreatment, etched with 70, 80, 85, 90, and 98% sulfuric acid for 60 s) were treated on PEEK. Surface roughness, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were examined. Shear bond strength (SBS) and cross-sectional observations of the interfaces were performed. One-way ANOVA analysis revealed differences in surface roughness and SBS between groups. The 90 and 98% sulfuric acid etching significantly achieved the highest SBS (p<0.05). SEM and AFM demonstrated etched surfaces with wide and deep pores. The 90 and 98% sulfuric acid etching were suggested to be the optimal concentration to improve adhesion between PEEK and the resin composite."
"Gene expression and microcomputed tomography analysis of grafted bone using deproteinized bovine bone and freeze-dried human bone  2018, by Quintessence Publishing Co. Inc.Purpose: Bio-Oss and demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) are two commercial bone grafts that have been associated with clinical success for many years. However, there are few in vivo studies regarding their healing mechanism. The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of bone formation using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and gene expression in mouse calvaria at 1 and 3 months after bone grafting with deproteinized bovine bone and freeze-dried human bone, and compare them to natural bone healing. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six mice were divided into three groups (n = 6 per group) according to the type of bone graft used: group 1 (control)-an empty defect without bone graft; group 2- treatment with deproteinized bovine xenograft (Bio-Oss); group 3-treatment with DFDBA. The bone graft was inserted into two 3-mm calvarial defects created on both sides of the parietal bone. At 1 and 3 months, the mice were sacrificed and bone volume was evaluated using micro-CT and gene expression analysis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that the parietal bone of mice grafted with Bio-Oss had significantly greater bone volume than both the DFDBA and control groups at both 1 and 3 months. The expression of bone marker genes (Runx2, Osterix [Osx], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], osteopontin [OPN], and osteocalcin [OCN]) were significantly increased from 1 month in both Bio-Oss and DFDBA groups at 3 months. Runx2 and Osx had significantly higher expression in the Bio-Oss and DFDBA groups compared to the control group at 3 months. No statistically significant difference was observed among groups after 1 month. Conclusion: These results showed that both bone graft materials promoted bone regeneration. Bio-Oss demonstrated high osteoconductive properties."
"Two new species of the millipede family Cambalopsidae from Myanmar (Diplopoda, Spirostreptida)  Natdanai Likhitrakarn et al.Two new species of cave-dwelling millipedes are described from Myanmar, one each in the genera Plusioglyphiulus Silvestri, 1923 and Trachyjulus Peters, 1864. Plusioglyphiulus digitiformis sp. n. joins the small peculiar group of congeners from Thailand which is characterized by such plesiomorphies as the tergal crests on the collum and following metaterga being transversely divided into two, not three parts, as in species of the genus Glyphiulus Gervais, 1847. However, this new species differs by the 3-segmented telopodites of ♂ legs 1, the anterior gonopodal coxosternum showing higher and nearly straight apicomesal processes and very evident apicolateral teeth, as well as the higher and acuminate paramedian coxal processes of the posterior gonopods, the latter’s telopodites demonstrating an apical fovea bearing a group of microsetae at the bottom. Trachyjulus bifidus sp. n. is primarily distinguished by the telopodites of their anterior gonopods being strikingly and deeply bifid. A key to the five species of Cambalopsidae currently known to occur in Myanmar is presented, and a map showing their distributions given."
"Roles of sodium dodecyl sulfate on tetrahydrofuran-assisted methane hydrate formation  2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) markedly improved tetrahydrofuran (THF)-assisted methane hydrate formation. Firstly, methane hydrate formation with different THF amount, 1, 3, and 5.56 mol%, was studied. SDS with 1, 4, and 8 mM was then investigated for its roles on the methane hydrate formation with and without THF. The experiments were conducted in a quiescent condition in a fixed volume crystallizer at 8 MPa and 4°C. The results showed that almost all studied THF and SDS concentrations enhanced the methane hydrate formation kinetics and methane consumption compared to that without the promoters, except 1 mol% THF. Although, with 1 mol% THF, there were no hydrates formed for 48 hours, the addition of just 1 mM SDS surprisingly promoted the hydrate formation with a significant increased in the kinetics. This prompts the use of methane hydrate technology for natural gas storage application with minimal promoters."

"Characteristics-improvement of QD semiconductor optical amplifier using rapid-thermal annealing process  2018 SPIE.We investigated the effect of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) process on Quantum Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (QD SOAs). The devices are composed of 30-layer stacks of InAs quantum dot by using strain compensation method. The lateral size and height of QD are 30 nm and 4 nm, respectively. Our QD SOAs have emission wavelengths within 1.5 μm-band. We applied RTA process to improve the characteristics of internal quantum efficiency (i) and optical loss (αi) of ridge laser diode for QD SOAs. In this case, the operating temperatures of RTA process were set at 600°C, 620°C, 640°C and 660°C for 30 seconds each. In addition, the devices are cleaved to form a cavity length at 0.06 cm, 0.08 cm, 0.10 cm, 0.12 cm and 0.14 cm. According to the L-I characteristic result of ridge laser diode structure for QD SOAs at 640°C, the best minimum threshold current (Ith) is 47.93 mA. Moreover, according to the plot between 1 ηd-1 (external quantum efficiency) and cavity length, we can optimize the internal quantum efficiency and optical loss for a ridge laser diode structure to be 66.39% and 9.87 cm-1 respectively at 640°C RTA's temperature. Finally, The RTA process helps to achieve 1.4 times higher in internal quantum efficiency as well as a minimal increase in internal optical loss comparing to without RTA."
"Cognition, emotional health, and immunological markers in children with long-term nonprogressive HIV  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Background: HIV-infected children with long-term nonprogressive (LTNP) disease eventually convert to a progressive disease type, yet the extent to which these children experience the cognitive and emotional symptoms observed in typical progressive HIV (Progressors) is unknown. Methods: Eighty-eight LTNPs, 53 Progressors, and 323 healthy controls completed annual assessments of cognitive and emotional health as part of a prospective study. The 2 HIV-infected groups and the healthy controls were matched on age and sex distribution at enrollment. Plasma HIV RNA, T-cell counts/percentages, activated monocytes, perivascular monocytes, and markers of macrophage activation (sCD163 and sCD14) were compared by progression subtype. Cognitive and emotional outcomes were compared using cross-sectional linear regression analysis and longitudinal sensitivity models. Results: LTNPs exhibited the same cognitive phenotype and emotional dysregulation as Progressors, with worse outcomes in both groups compared with controls. In addition, cognitive and emotional symptoms were evident before children reached the minimum age for LTNP designation (8 years). Baseline plasma HIV RNA, sCD163, activated monocytes, and perivascular monocytes were lower in LTNPs versus Progressors, with no difference in T-cell counts/percentages or sCD14 levels. Most LTNPs converted to a progressive disease subtype during the study, with similar cognitive and emotion profiles between these subgroups. Conclusions: Pediatric LTNPs experience cognitive and emotional difficulties that mirror symptoms of progressive disease. The abnormalities are present at young ages and persist independent of plasma T-cell counts. The findings highlight the neurodevelopmental risk of pediatric HIV, even in those with early innate disease control."
"Age-Related Reference Intervals for Blood Amino Acids in Thai Pediatric Population Measured by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry  2018 Jaraspong Uaariyapanichkul et al.Background. Age, race, and analytic method influence levels of blood amino acids, of which reference intervals are required for the diagnosis and management of inherited metabolic disorders. Objectives. To establish age-specific reference intervals for blood amino acids in Thai pediatric population measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Methods. A cross-sectional study of 277 healthy children from birth to 12 years was conducted. Anthropometric, clinical, and dietary information were recorded. Dried blood spots on a filtered paper were used for measurement by derivatized LC-MS/MS. Factors that might affect amino acids such as fasting time and dietary intake were analyzed using quantile regression analysis. Results. Levels of thirteen blood amino acids were reported as median and interval from 2.5th-97.5th percentiles. Compared with those of Caucasian, most blood amino acid levels of Thai children were higher. Compared with a previous study using HPLC in Thai children, many amino acid levels are different. Glycine, alanine, leucine/isoleucine, and glutamic acid sharply decreased after birth. Citrulline, arginine, and methionine stayed low from birth throughout childhood, whereas phenylalanine was at middle level and slightly increased during preadolescence. Conclusion. Reference intervals of age-specific blood amino acids using LC-MS/MS were established in the Thai pediatric population. They diverge from previous studies, substantiating the recommendation that, for the optimal clinical practice, age-specific reference intervals of amino acids should be designated for the particular population and analysis method."
"Clinical Features and Treatment Outcomes among Children with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis: A 20-Year Study in a Tertiary Referral Hospital  2018 Susheera Chatproedprai et al.Aim. To determine the probable causative factors, clinical features, and treatment outcomes of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and SJS-TEN overlap in children. Methods. A 20-year database review of all children diagnosed with SJS/TEN/SJS-TEN overlap at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand. Results. 36 patients (M: F, 16: 20) with the mean age of 9.2±4.0 years were identified. There were 20 cases of SJS, 4 cases of SJS-TEN overlap, and 12 cases of TEN. Drugs were the leading cause for the diseases (72.3%); antiepileptics were the most common culprits (36.1%). Cutaneous morphology at presentation was morbilliform rash (83.3%), blister (38.9%), targetoid lesions (25.0%), and purpuric macules (2.8%). Oral mucosa (97.2%) and eye (83.3%) were the 2 most common mucosal involvements. Majority of the cases (77.8%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or both. Treatment outcomes between those who received systemic therapy and those who received only supportive care were comparable. Skin and eye were the principal sites of short-term and long-term complications. Conclusions. SJS/TEN are not common but are serious diseases which lead to significant morbidities in children. Early withdrawal of suspicious causes and meticulous supportive care are very important. This study found that the systemic therapy was not superior to supportive care because the treatment outcomes for both groups were comparable."
"Binding TiO2 nanoparticles to forward osmosis membranes: Via MEMO-PMMA-Br monomer chains for enhanced filtration and antifouling performance  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Forward osmosis (FO) has attracted increasing interest in various applications for water and wastewater treatment and reuse. However, drawbacks caused by its lower-than-expected flux performance and fouling issues remain bottlenecks that limit the wider applications of FO technology. In this research, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were grafted onto two commercially available FO membranes, a cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane and an aquaporin (AqP) membrane, through a specially designed 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate-polymethyl methacrylate-bromide (MEMO-PMMA-Br) monomer chain, to improve the filtration performance with regard to pure water flux and organic fouling resistance. The success of the surface coating method was verified using FT-IR, SEM-EDX, and AFM. Approximately 30% titanium coverage was obtained for both FO membranes. A reduction of the contact angle on the modified CTA membrane surface indicated enhanced water permeability and antifouling performance. An adverse effect on the surface hydrophilicity of the modified AqP membrane may be attributed to the obstruction of aquaporins from the feed solution due to the coverage of MEMO-PMMA-Br monomers and TiO2 nanoparticles. The pure water flux of both membranes was significantly improved, with average flux increases of 73.4% and 13.6% identified for the modified CTA and AqP membranes, respectively. In addition, the antifouling performance of the AqP membrane was greatly enhanced after surface modification, attributed to the integrated effects of foulant photodegradation (catalyzed by TiO2 nanoparticles at the interface) and the prevention of functional water channels being blocked by organic foulants due to TiO2 coverage."
"Thrombocytopenia in moderate- to high-risk sutureless aortic valve replacement  The Korean Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. 2018.Background: This study aimed to compare preliminary data on the outcomes of sutureless aortic valve replacement (SU-AVR) with those of aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of SU-AVR in moderate- to high-risk patients from 2013 to 2016. Matching was performed at a 1:1 ratio using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality score with sex and age. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. The secondary outcomes were operative outcomes and complications. Results: A total of 277 patients were studied. Ten patients (50% males; median age, 81.5 years) underwent SU-AVR. Postoperative echocardiography showed impressive outcomes in the SU-AVR group. The 30-day mortality was 10% in both groups. In our study, the patients in the SU-AVR group developed postoperative thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts decreased from 225×103 /μL preoperatively to 94.5, 54.5, and 50.1×103 /μL on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3, respectively, showing significant differences compared with the AVR group (p=0.04, p=0.16, and p=0.20, respectively). The median amount of platelet transfusion was higher in the AVR group (12.5 vs. 0 units, p=0.052). Conclusion: There was no difference in the 30-day mortality of moderateto high-risk patients depending on whether they underwent SU-AVR or AVR. Although SU-AVR is associated with favorable cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times, it may be associated with postoperative thrombocytopenia."
"Solubilization of fluocinolone acetonide by cosolvents and surfactants for buccal solution preparation  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Objective: Fluocinolone acetonide (FA) buccal solution was prepared for treatment of oral lichen planus using cosolvents and surfactants to enhance FA solubility. Results: Based on solubility power (σ) in the concentration range of 0–40% w/w, cosolvents enhanced FA solubility in the order; polyethylene glycol 400 (σ = 3.06 × 10−2)> propylene glycol (σ = 2.92 × 10−2)> glycerin (σ = 0.95 × 10−2). The order of FA solubility in surfactant solutions was 1% polysorbate 80 (1.04 × 10−2 %w/v)>0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (0.69 × 10−2 %w/v)>0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) (0.27 × 10−2 %w/v). Cosolvents increased the critical micelle concentration, especially for ionizable surfactants (SLS and cetylpyridinium chloride [CPC]). These effects of cosolvents on micellization impeded the ability of the surfactants to increase FA solubility. Both polysorbate 80 and CPC induced degradation of FA. Conclusion: We conclude that a 0.01% FA buccal solution should be prepared in a cosolvent system without use of surfactants."
"Prediction of groundwater table depth using direct rainfall-groundwater statistical correlations in Thailand  2006 Institute of Research and Development, Suranaree University of Technology.Intensive water resources development in past decades has had large impacts on hydrogeological systems at basin-scales. Decision-makers require adequate information on both surface water and groundwater potential in order to formulate sustainable water resources development strategies. The present study aims to develop statistical models through multiple linear regression analysis of rainfall-groundwater data to investigate any direct response of groundwater to rainfall at representative sites in the Chao-Phraya river basin of Thailand. The monthly rainfall and groundwater data sets from several rain gauge and piezometric stations in the study areas for the period 2007- 2008 were collected from the Royal Irrigation Department, Thai Meteorological Department, and Department of Groundwater Resources (Thailand). It was initially hypothesized (and later on confirmed) that the groundwater table depth of the previous period was due to the slower movement of groundwater through recharge and infiltration processes. The multiple linear correlation analysis has been carried out to study the influence of rainfall, antecedent rainfall, and antecedent groundwater table depth on groundwater depth. The influencing variables have been selected based on the measures of multiple linear correlations. Because the groundwater database is not frequently updated compared to the precipitation and surface water database, the relationships proposed herein may be adopted to predict groundwater table depths to a reasonable degree of accuracy for better planning and management of groundwater resources of the basin."
"Ethical cases on professional pharmacy practice in Thailand during A.D. 1995–2015  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University.

Conclusions: Suggestions for solving ethical problems in pharmacy profession are (1) to cultivate ethical behavior for pharmacy students, (2) to set up the ethics as a regulation and to promote ethics as a main policy of The Pharmacy Council of Thailand, (3) to strictly enforce the use of pharmacy profession ethics, and (4) to develop monitoring and checking systems for the professional practice of pharmacists."
"Relationship between mandibular symphysis dimensions and mandibular anterior alveolar bone thickness as assessed with cone-beam computed tomography  2018 Dental Press Journal of Orthodontics.Objective: To determine the relationship between symphysis dimensions and alveolar bone thickness (ABT) of the mandibular anterior teeth. Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography images of 51 patients were collected and measured. The buccal and lingual ABT of the mandibular anterior teeth was measured at 3 and 6 mm apical to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and at the root apices. The symphysis height and width were measured. The symphysis ratio was the ratio of symphysis height to symphysis width. Kendall’s tau correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationships between the variables at a 0.05 significance level.Results: The mandibular anterior teeth lingual and apical ABT positively correlated with symphysis width (p <0.05). Moreover, these thicknesses negatively correlated with the symphysis ratio (p <0.05). Symphysis widths and ratios showed higher correlation coefficients with total and buccal apical ABT, compared with lingual ABT. Buccal ABT at 3 and 6 mm apical to the CEJ was not significantly correlated with most symphysis dimensions. The mean thickness of the buccal alveolar bone at the upper root half was only 0.2-0.6 mm, which was very thin, when compared with other regions. Conclusion: For mandibular anterior teeth, the apical alveolar bone and lingual alveolar bone tended to be thicker in patients with a wide and short symphysis, compared to those with a narrow and long symphysis. Buccal alveolar bone was, in general, very thin and did not show a significant relationship with most symphysis dimensions."
"Population pharmacokinetics analysis of vancomycin in critically ill patients  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine population pharmacokinetic parameters of vancomycin in adult critically ill patients and to investigate the covariates affecting population pharmacokinetic parameters. Methods: Plasma concentration data from therapeutic drug monitoring were collected from a retrospective study. Vancomycin population pharmacokinetic modeling was analyzed using nonlinear mixed effect model (NONMEM) program. Patient characteristics that could potentially influence vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters were tested in the pharmacokinetic model. The covariates were analyzed by the forward inclusion and backward elimination method to identify their potential influence on vancomycin parameter. To assess the robustness of the estimated parameter, bootstrap analysis was performed. Results: A total of 171 patients with 398 concentrations during clinical routine therapeutic monitoring were analysis. Vancomycin serum concentration-time profiles were best described by a one-compartmental model with first-order elimination. Creatinine clearance calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation, diabetes mellitus and sepsis were found significantly influence CL whereas V of vancomycin showed the significant dependence on patient serum creatinine and gender. The mean population parameters were CL = 3.63 L/h and V = 118 L. The inter-individual variability for CL and V was 32.90 and 29.12 %, respectively. A comparison of the population pharmacokinetic parameters of vancomycin in the final model estimated in NONMEM with original data and 1000 bootstrap samples show that both sets of estimates were comparable, thereby indicating the robustness of the proposed model. Conclusions: A population pharmacokinetic model of vancomycin for critically ill patients with Gram-positive infections was developed in this study. The population pharmacokinetic parameters and the significant covariates distinguished in the final model can provide helpful information to facilitate individualized vancomycin dosage regimen with similar patient population characteristics."

Further investigations were pursued, which identified Mycobacterium asiaticum. Appropriate therapy with isoniazid, rifampin and clarithromycin for total 18 months (including pyrazinamide and ethambutol for first 4 months) resulted in clinical and radiographic improvement. Recognition of the possibility of this rarely described pulmonary pathogen is essential for successful treatment."
"Qualified measurement setup of polarization extinction ratio for Panda PMF with LC/UPC connector  2018 SPIE.Polarization Extinction Ratio (PER) is one of the key parameters for Polarization Maintaining Fiber (PMF) connector. Based on our previous studies, the bending radius of fiber greater than 1.5 cm will not affect the insertion loss of PMF [1]. Moreover, the measured PER of Panda PMF with LC/UPC connectors is more stable when that PMF is coiled around a hot rod with a minimum of 3-cm in diameter at 75°C temperature [2]. Hence, the hot rod with less constrained 6-cm in diameter at constant 75°C was selected for this PER measurement. Two PER setups were verified and compared for measuring LC/UPC PMF connectors. The Polarized Laser Source (PLS) at 1550 nm wavelength and PER meter from OZ Optics were used in both setups, in which the measured connector was connected to PLS at 0° angle while the other end was connected to PER meter. In order to qualify our setups, the percentage of Repeatability and Reproducibility (%R&R) were tested and calculated. In each setup, the PER measurement was repeated 3 trials by 3 appraisers using 10 LC/UPC PMF connectors (5 LC/UPC PMF patchcords with 3.5±0.5 meters in length) in random order. The 1st setup, PMF was coiled at a larger 20-cm diameter for 3 to 5 loops and left in room temperature during the test. The 2nd setup, PMF was coiled around a hot rod at constant 75°C with 6-cm diameter for 8 to 10 loops for at least 5 minutes before testing. There are 3 ranges of %R&R acceptation guide line: <10% is acceptable, between 10% - 30% is marginal, and <30% is unacceptable. According to our results, the %R&R of the 1stPER test setup was 16.2% as marginality, and the 2nd PER test setup was 8.9% as acceptance. Thus, providing the better repeatability and reproducibility, this 2nd PER test setup having PMF coiled around a hot rod at constant 75°C with 6-cm diameter was selected for our next study of the impact of hot temperature on PER in LC/UPC PMF connector."
"Assessment of heavy metals in Sediment at Saphan Hin, Phuket Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.This study was conducted to assess the level of metal pollution in sediment samples at two different locations at Saphan Hin, which received water from Bang-Yai canal. The total content of Tin (Sn), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) by aqua regia digestion. The ranges of metal concentration (mg kg-1) were 9.04 - 32.17 mg kg-1 and 6.33 - 36.52 mg kg-1 of Pb in Core A and B; and 32.83 - 68.49 mg kg-1 and 21.63 - 73.59 mg kg-1 of Zn in Core A and B, which is below the Sediment Quality Guidelines of Threshold Effects Concentration (TEC) (35.8 mg Pb kg-1 and 121 mg Zn kg-1). Sn was not detected (< 0.03 mg kg-1). Analysis of the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) clearly indicated that most of the analysed sediment samples were not contaminated with the studied metals since low Igeo values were observed (Igeo Pb and Igeo Zn < 0). The detected enrichment factor (EFPb) values between 2.0 and 6.0 indicated moderate enrichment, while most of the sediments had EFZn values below 2 which exhibited deficiency to minimal enrichment. The EF values in this study (EF > 1.5) indicates a significant portion of the trace metals was delivered from non-crustal materials and that may be delivered by other sources. Correlation analysis showed positive relationships between Pb and Zn in both cores (r = 0.5** Core A and 0.941** Core B). The association of Pb and Zn is possibly because they originated from the same sources. The determination of other metals should be considered further."
"The impact of dynamic assessment on tertiary EFL students' speaking skills  2018, The Asian Journal of Applied Linguistics.This study discusses the use of dynamic assessment for pedagogical purposes. Conducting dynamic assessment (DA), grounded in Vygotsky's zone of proximal development (ZPD), we studied a group of Thai university students who had difficulties in speaking English. We adopted DA as an alternative assessment in the context of teaching English as a foreign language (EFL). This investigation is aimed at the students' potential to improve their speaking skills in the test task called elicited imitation (EI). EI, which prompted the students to repeat sentences, was used to target specific features of the students' English speaking in this study namely meaning, syntax, vocabulary, pronunciation, and fluency. Through the test-train-retest design, DA improved the students' English speaking. The findings of both qualitative and quantitative data indicated positive impacts of DA on the students. Data from retrospective interviews and diaries showed that DA brought about meaningful learning experiences. The students also exhibited positive attitudes toward DA. The findings suggest that DA can be used in a classroom practice to promote development in the students' English speaking ability."
"Measurement of characteristic parameters of 10 Gb/s bidirectional optical amplifier for XG-PON  2018 SPIE.This research experimentally measured the characteristic parameters of 10 Gb/s bidirectional optical amplifier: (1) operating wavelength range, (2) small signal gain, (3) Polarization Dependent Loss (PDL), and (4) power consumption. Bidirectional amplifiers are the key component to extend coverage area as well as increase a number of users in Passive Optical Networks (PON). According to 10-Gigabit-capable PON or XG-PON standard, the downstream and upstream wavelengths are 1577 nm and 1270 nm respectively. Thus, our bidirectional amplifier consists of an Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) and a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) for downstream and upstream wavelength transmissions respectively. The operating wavelengths of EDFA and SOA are measured to be from 1570 nm to 1588 nm and 1263 nm to 1280 nm respectively. To measure gain, the input wavelengths of EDFA and SOA were fixed at 1577 nm and 1271 nm respectively, while their input powers were reduced by a variable optical attenuator. The small signal gain of EDFA is 22.5 dB at 0.15 Ampere pump current, whereas the small signal gain of SOA is 7.06 dB at 0.325 Ampere pump current. To measure PDL, which is a difference in output powers at various State of Polarization (SoP) of input signal, a polarization controller was inserted before amplifier to alter input SoP. The measured PDL of EDFA is insignificant with less than 0.1 dB. In contrast, the measured PDL of SOA is as large as 33 dB, indicating its strong polarization dependence. The total power consumptions were measured to be 1.5675 Watt."
"CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas for enhanced oil recovery Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Due to the climate change and global warming, the concern about CO2 emission into the atmosphere has been raised in many industries such as oil and gas business. The sources of CO2 include natural gas processing and other processes. The current technology to mitigate CO2 is carbon capture, storage and utilisation. At the same time, oil production is expected to increase due to the higher consumption. CO2 geological storage in depleting oilfield coupled with enhanced oil recovery can be a better technology to meet both requirements. The excellent example of this technology is the Weyburn Project in Canada that can store CO2 and produce more oil as well as prolong the reservoir life. From this successful project, the technology is studied by applying it with the depleting oilfield for both oil production and CO2 storage in the North of Thailand by using simulation model. It becomes the objective of this research, which is to evaluate CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas (WAG) for enhanced oil recovery as well as to study the effects the parameters, such as total hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) injection and WAG ratio, on oil production and CO2 consumption and sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, with the added benefit of carbon sequestration. CMG software from Computer Modeling Group Ltd. is used to create the 3D simulation model to predict the CO2 storage in the geological formation. From the simulation, the results reported that oil can be produced up to 125,976 m3 of oil or 57 % recovery, CO2 consumption is 66,261 m3 of gas and CO2 utilisation is approximately 0.53 m3 of gas per m3 of oil. The main parameters for WAG process is WAG ratio in that oil production increases as WAG ratio increases. CO2 consumption increases with total HCPV injection. The results of this study can be applied to develop the CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the depleting oilfield in the North of Thailand for both oil production and CO2 storage."
"Mixture of MEA/2-MAE for effective CO2 capture from flue gas stream Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.The climate change and global warming are the main environmental concerns because of CO2 emission into the atmosphere. The main sources of CO2 is from power plants in the form of flue gas. Recently, the effective technology to capture CO2 is chemical absorption by using aqueous amine solutions. The commonly used amine solution is monoethanolamine (MEA). It has disadvantages like low capacity and high energy consumption. 2-methylaminoethanol (2-MAE) as a new solvent has been formulated to improve the performance of CO2 mitigation but the cost of this chemical is higher. The two amines are mixed together to obtain higher performance and to compensate the drawbacks of each solvents. The objective of this research is to measure the solubility of CO2 in a mixed solvent with 20: 10 wt% of MEA and 2-MAE for CO2 capture from the flue gas stream at the temperature of 313.15 K and 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa. The experimental results are compared with that of single solution of MEA and 2-MAE at the same conditions. From the results, it is reported that in term of cyclic capacity, the amine mixture provides a better performance, which is higher than that of MEA ranging from 2.35 % to 61.90 % but lower than that of 2-MAE from 8.76 % to 43.45 %. The rate of CO2 loading of mixed solution is relatively close to that of MEA but lower than that of 2-MAE. Therefore, in the future, the mixed solvent may be used as an alternative solution for CO2 capture instead of using single amine."
"Measurement of CO2 absorption in a 4 m aqueous solution of 3-amino-1-propanol for CO2 removal Copyright  2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission into the atmosphere causes environmental concern. The main sources of CO2 come from industries such as power generation. The current technology to remove CO2 effectively is carbon capture and storage or CCS especially absorption with aqueous amine solutions. The commonly used amine solutions are monoethanolamine (MEA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). They have some disadvantages like low capacity and high energy consumption. A new solvent such as 3-amino-1-propanol (AP) has been designed to be used as an alternative solvent for CO2 removal. This solvent should provide the absorption and cyclic capacities close or higher than the commercial ones. The objective of this research is to measure the CO2 absorption in a 4 M aqueous solution of AP at the temperature from 303.15 K to 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa and the absorption results of CO2 in AP solution are compared with that of aqueous solution of MEA. From the experiment, the results present that AP at 4 M provides the performance relatively close to that of MEA. The cyclic capacities of AP are relatively lower than that of MEA for 26.83 and 2.73 % for CO2 partial pressure at 15 and 100 kPa. The absorption capacity of AP is higher when CO2 partial pressure increases and reduces as temperature increases. AP can be considered as an alternative solvent for CO2 removal at high CO2 partial pressure. Other properties like kinetics, mass transfer, energy penalty for solvent regeneration as well as other criteria have to be investigated for AP before it can be used for commercial purposes."
"Short-term efficacy and safety of adding Ezetimibe to current regimen of lipid-lowering drugs in human immunodeficiency virus-infected Thai patients treated with protease inhibitors  2018, National Institute of Health. All rights reserved.Long-term complications of protease inhibitor (PI) treatment includes increased cardiovascular risks due to dyslipidemia in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Ezetimibe reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) without drug interactions with PIs and statins. Furthermore, the addition of ezetimibe to statins is an optional treatment in HIV-infected patients with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. The objective of this study was to determine the short-term efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to the currently administered statin regimen. Thirty-two patients received ezetimibe (10 mg daily) in addition to their ongoing lipid-lowering therapy for 18 weeks. Serum LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, and HDL-C were measured at baseline, and weeks 6, 12, and 18. Safety parameters were assessed by adverse event reports and laboratory assessments throughout the study. The mean percent change from baseline to endpoint in LDL-C, TC, TGs, and TC/HDL-C ratio were −23.3% (p < 0.001), −15.0% (p = 0.001), −22.1% (p = 0.004), and −16.2% (p = 0.018), respectively. No adverse event or other abnormal laboratory results occurred. Addition of ezetimibe to currently administered lipid-lowering drugs in HIV-infected patients receiving PIs with uncontrolled dyslipidemia demonstrated significantly improved efficacy in reducing their LDL-C, TC, TGs, and TC/HDL-C ratio levels. Moreover, this therapy was safe and well-tolerated."
"Proton exchange membrane based on sulfonated poly (aromatic imide-co-aliphatic imide) for direct methanol fuel cell  2018 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos. All rights reserved.A new sulfonated poly(aromatic imide-co-aliphatic imide) (SPI) for the use as a polymer electrolyte membrane was successfully synthesized from 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM), 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane-2,2'-disulfonic acid disodium salt (S-DDM), hexamethylenediamine, and 3,3',4,4'-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride in a one-step reaction. S-DDM was prepared by the direct sulfonation of DDM monomer. The degree of sulfonation of the sulfonated copolyimide was varied by using various molar concentrations of S-DDM. The sulfonated copolyimide with the highest degree of sulfonation possessed the proton conductivity of 0.0032 S.cm-1 in a wet state. The highest methanol permeability of the sulfonated copolyimide was 2.75 × 10-8 cm2.s-1 which is ~425 times lower than that of the Nafion 117. The highest membrane selectivity belonged to the membrane with 34% degree of sulfonation with the value of 1.65 × 106 s.S.cm-3 which is three orders of magnitude higher than the commercial Nafion 117."

"Solubility of cyclodextrins and drug/cyclodextrin complexes  2018 by the authors.Cyclodextrins (CDs), a group of oligosaccharides formed by glucose units bound together in a ring, show a promising ability to form complexes with drug molecules and improve their physicochemical properties without molecular modifications. The stoichiometry of drug/CD complexes is most frequently 1:1. However, natural CDs have a tendency to self-assemble and form aggregates in aqueous media. CD aggregation can limit their solubility. Through derivative formation, it is possible to enhance their solubility and complexation capacity, but this depends on the type of substituent and degree of substitution. Formation of water-soluble drug/CD complexes can increase drug permeation through biological membranes. To maximize drug permeation the amount of added CD into pharmaceutical preparation has to be optimized. However, solubility of CDs, especially that of natural CDs, is affected by the complex formation. The presence of pharmaceutical excipients, such as water-soluble polymers, preservatives, and surfactants, can influence the solubilizing abilities of CDs, but this depends on the excipients’ physicochemical properties. The competitive CD complexation of drugs and excipients has to be considered during formulation studies."
"The effect of temperature on the methanogenic activity in relation to micronutrient availability  2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the view of microbial community, thermophilic microorganisms were reported to have faster biochemical reaction rates, which are reflected by a higher methane production rate. However, there has no research to discuss the effect of temperature on methanogenic activity in relation to micronutrient transport and availability. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of temperature on methanogenic activity in relation to nutrient uptakes, micronutrient transports, and mass balance using anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) with recycled biogas for treating ethanol wastewater at mesophilic (37 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) temperatures. The increase in temperature from 37 to 55 °C increased in both of the optimum chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate and methanogenic activity, corresponding to the results of N and P uptakes, energy balance, and mass balance. The higher temperature of the thermophilic operation as compared to the mesophilic one caused a lower water solubility of the produced H2S, leading to lowering the reduction of divalent cation micronutrients. The thermophilic operation could prevent the deficit of micronutrients, thus causing a higher methanogenic activity, while the mesophilic operation still had the deficit of most micronutrients, leading to the lower activity."
"Description of two new species of the earthworm genus, metaphire (Clitellata: Megascolecidae), from Kedah, Peninsular Malaysia  National University of Singapore.A field survey of terrestrial earthworms was conducted in the states of Penang, Kedah, and Perak, in Peninsular Malaysia, and revealed two new species of terrestrial earthworm belonging to the genus Metaphire Sims & Easton, 1972, which are described herein. Metaphire sedimensis new species, belongs to the octothecal group, characterised by having small circular of genital markings on post-setal of VI, VII, VIII, XVII, and XVIII. Metaphire hijaunensis new species, has three pairs of spermathecae at VII–IX, typical of the sexthecal houlleti species group but differs from these other members by its body size, position of the intestine origin and the number and shape of genital marking glands. Evolutionary divergence between the new species and their most closely related species revealed a high interspecific genetic distance of 16.4–22.9%, while the pairwise distance between M. sedimensis new species, and M. hijauensis new species was 21.3%. The detailed descriptions and illustrations of the two new species are supplemented with their DNA barcodes in order to facilitate future species identifications."
"Quick recovery of leaf photosynthesis and fruit quality from soil water deficit of citrus aurantiifolia growing in a city  2018, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.Under the projected warming climate, water scarcity will become one of the main challenges for growing crops. Such issue is particularly difficult in urban environments where growing conditions for plants are limited and warming effect is intensified. Here, we showed that infrequent irrigation may be performed when growing lime (Citrus aurantiifolia) saplings in Bangkok, Thailand, with quick recovery of photosynthesis and fruit quality. During a two-week water-deficit experiment, stomatal conductance of the lime saplings decreased up to 67% when soil moisture declined by 40% from the control level on day 6, resulting in 27% and 16% reductions of net photosynthesis (Anet) and transpiration (E), respectively. Accordingly, water-use efficiency decreased by 20%. After that, irrigation was resumed to study the recovery effect on the gas exchange parameters. Results showed full recovery after 3 days with Anet, E and WUE values not statistically different from those in the control group. Lime fruits were harvested for analysis of vitamin C content. We found that, after the water deficit and re-watering, vitamin C content in the lime fruits was not affected, showing similar values across treatments. Our results suggested that discontinuous irrigation (i.e. up to 6 days of withheld irrigation) may be applied to induce moderate soil water deficit (-40% of the control level) when growing the lime saplings in a raised-bed plot in the city, without affecting photosynthesis and fruit quality. This finding offers an approach for sustainable urban agriculture in the future drying environments."
"Leaf litter decomposition in headwater streams, nam nao national park, Thailand  2018, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.Objectives of this research are to investigate long-term responses of leaf litter decomposition rates involved some abiotic factors and colonized macroinvertebrates in leaf litter bags at headwater streams, Nam Nao National Park by comparing data between 2002 and 2014. Three grams dry weight of Bambusa arundinacea Willd. was put in an individual nylon bag and they were placed in riffles and pools at 2 streams. These litter bags from each stream were retrieved every 2 weeks of immersion. Results showed that leaf breakdown rates were more rapidly in riffle than in pool and the rate was faster at Phromlaeng stream than those of Yakruae stream in both years. Increasing of water velocity was considered to increase leaf decay. Macroinvertebrates colonizing in the leaf litter bags was similar in 2002 and 2014. In both years, Dipteran and Ephemeropteran larvae were the most abundant (more than 50%) in the litter bags throughout the study, which were primarily collector-gatherers in the leaf litter bags. Shredders directly consumed leaves and other coarse particle organic matters were low abundance. Collector-filters were more abundant in riffle. Scrappers and predators did not feed on detritus, but they utilized the litter bag for shelter. In conclusion, decomposition rate was more rapidly caused by increasing water velocity. Increase in water velocity was a consequence of increase in precipitation which was directly related to climate change."
"Biosorption of Cr (III) and ni (II) from an aqueous solution using cuttlebone and application for battery manufacturing wastewater treatment  2018, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.The contamination of heavy metals in wastewater that has extremely low pH, is over the standard limit for heavy metals (Pb and Cr), and has a high amount of total dissolved solids (TDS) is a serious problem in lead-acid battery manufacturing. Various studies have shown that biosorption is an effective and economical technology for removing heavy metals. In this study, Cr (III) and Ni (II) adsorption of cuttlebone powder (CB) was tested, and CB was applied to treat wastewater generated by lead-acid battery manufacturing. The Cr (III) adsorption of CB was optimum in an initial pH of 6.0 using CB 0.4 g/L; in addition, Ni (II) adsorption was optimum in an initial pH of 3.0 using CB 0.2 g/L. The adsorption kinetic was suitable, as it demonstrated a high correlation coefficient (R2>0.9) with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Both Cr (III) and Ni (II) adsorption were in equilibrium in 20 minutes. By Langmuir isotherm (R2>0.9), the maximum adsorption capacity of CB was 555.55 mg/g in Cr (III) adsorption and 78.74 mg/g in Ni (II). CB was an effective biosorbent, pH neutralizer, and heavy metal remover. On the laboratory scale, lead-acid battery wastewater was successfully treated into the industrial effluent standard limit using a combination of Ca(OH)2 pre-treatment and CB."
"Phytotolerance, phytotoxicity and phytoremediation of Cd and EDTA mixtures with napier grass  2018, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment. All rights reserved.The main objective of this study was to investigate the cadmium resistance of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and the application of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) on cadmium toxicity reduction. This study design includes batch experiments. These experiments were divided into three sequential parts which were: (1) Effect of cadmium concentration (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/L); (2) Effect of EDTA concentration (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/L), and (3) Effect of molar ratio of cadmium and EDTA (1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2). The results from part 1 and part 2 were used in part 3. Napier grass were glowed the plant in distillated water (DI) and aeration was applied throughout the experiment. Percentage of phytotoxicity and relative growth rate (RGR) were used as the main indicators. The plant samples were collected on the 15th, 30th and 45th days of the experiment. At a cadmium concentration of 40 mg/L, the maximum cadmium accumulation in plants was observed. However, the Napier grass showed low phytotoxicity while the RGR was higher. This implied that cadmium could be used as a supplement for Napier grass. Moreover, applying EDTA could potentially increase the cadmium accumulation and lower the phytotoxicity. The highest cadmium accumulation in Napier grass was observed on the 45th day of the experiment at a mole ratio of cadmium to EDTA of 1:2. Thus, this research suggests that the ratio of cadmium and EDTA at 1:2 mole was appropriated for the application and further development. This is because cadmium and EDTA at 1:2 mole has the highest efficiency in terms of cadmium accumulation in the roots and shoots. In addition, lower cadmium toxicity was demonstrated in the other experiments."
"Expression of keratins, epidermal proteins and inflammatory cells in superficial pemphigus dogs  2018, Trakia University. All rights reserved.Superficial pemphigus in dogs is an autoimmune skin disorder. The disease is characterised by the binding of auto-antibodies to desmosomal molecules including desmocollin-1, a major auto-antigen in dogs. However, data on the expression of epidermal proteins in dogs are still limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the keratins and epidermal proteins in dogs with superficial pemphigus using immunohistochemistry. Skin biopsies were performed on dogs with pemphigus foliaceus (n=10), pan-epidermal pustular pemphigus (n=4) and pemphigus erythematosus (n=1). Immunostaining for keratin 5 and keratin 10 showed a premature and discontinuous pattern in the suprabasal layers of all pemphigus skin samples compared to the control group (P<0.05). Filaggrin, desmocollin-1 and claudin-1, but not involucrin, were significantly reduced (P<0.05). Inflammatory cells markedly infiltrated in the dermis and the lower epidermis of all pemphigus skins. This is the first report that associates changes in the expression of keratin 5, keratin 10, filaggrin and claudin-1 with reduced desmocollin-1 expression and subsequent loss of the epidermal barrier in superficial pemphigus."

Online questionnaires were distributed to the target population, and only results from respondents with experience of downloading stickers were analysed. Two hundred respondents from each gender group were successfully collected. The result of the study reveals that male consumers are influenced by three factors which are price utility, aesthetics, and social value. On the other hand, female consumers are influenced by price utility, aesthetics, social value and playfulness. The finding of this study has contributed to sticker creators to strategically design stickers to meet the demand of consumers more accurately."
"PDMS-based microfluidic device for infrared-transmission spectro-electrochemistry  2018 The Chemical Society of Japan.Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a well-known material used in making microfluidic devices through soft lithography. PDMS strongly absorbs infrared (IR) light in the mid infrared region, which can be alleviated by using thin-film PDMS devices. However, IR detection with PDMS devices usually requires an IR-transparent backbone material. Here, we report a microfluidic system using a 160 m PDMS thin-film device (50-m path length) without a supporting backbone for IR spectroelectrochemistry (IR-SEC). The PDMS device is assembled with four layers: microchannel-supporting window, microchannel thin film, electrode-embedded thin film, and electrode-supporting window. In this work, mapping of ferrocyanide oxidation was investigated under an IR microscope. An electrochemical reaction, occurring between the working and counter electrodes, was observed clearly. Moreover, the electron-transfer process of ferrocyanide oxidation was investigated from the IR absorbance spectrum. This mapping study demonstrates that the relationship between the electrochemical reactants and products partly agree well with the Nernst equation. Accordingly, PDMS thin-film devices have the capability for studying electrochemical reactions by using IR-SEC measurements with low sample consumption."
"What we need to solve the urgent crisis of and how to develop sustainable Long Term Care in Thailand: Policy makers' perspectives  2018 Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association.Thailand's growing aging population who have increased longevity has resulted in an upsurge in disability and the expectation of chronic diseases. The demand for increased care challenges the government to develop treatment and long-term management procedures. This study explores the following two objectives: 1) identifying policies for intervention that improve the quality of life of the elderly; and 2) developing a sustainable and feasible ten-year delivery system for Long Term Care (LTC). We conducted comprehensive interviews with 8 male and 3 female policy makers on LTC development for the elderly in Thailand and analyzed these transcripts by using NVivo 8 data analysis. Two independent investigations that contain thematic codes have been developed from the transcript subset's first set. Six of the identified issues - care services imbalance, poor management, skill search, health workforce scarcity, regulations, and information system problems - are considered urgent and require a solution. The surveys reiterate that an LTC scheme will become family- and community-based in a decade. The improvements in the quality of life for elderly patients with long-term conditions are accomplished through integrated services, regulatory system consolidation, an LTC workforce, infrastructure delivery, and investment in elderly health groups. LTC must use an all-inclusive societal policy."
"Highly porous core-shell chitosan beads with superb immobilization efficiency for: Lactobacillus reuteri 121 inulosucrase and production of inulin-type fructooligosaccharides  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.With the aim to overcome the limitations of hydrogel chitosan beads (HGBs), various types of chitosan, core-shell chitosan beads (CSBs), and dried chitosan beads (DBs) were synthesized. Physical and chemical properties were compared with those of HGBs. CSBs were proved to be an effective support because they displayed higher stability and capacity over the HGBs, and thus, were selected for enzyme immobilization. Recombinant inulosucrase (INU) from Lactobacillus reuteri 121 was immobilized on CSBs using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker. Immobilized biocatalysts (INU-CSBs) were then used for the synthesis of inulin-type fructooligosaccharide (IFOS). Biochemical characterization revealed that the optimum pH of both INU-CSBs and free enzyme was unaltered at 5.5 whereas the optimum temperature of INU-CSBs shifted from 50 °C to 60 °C. Moreover, pH stability and thermostability of INU-CSBs significantly improved. For batch synthesis of IFOS, INU-CSBs retained approximately 45% of their initial catalytic activity after being reused for 12 cycles. IFOS was also continuously synthesized in a fixed-bed bioreactor for a reaction duration of at least 30 h. The high efficiency of INU-CSBs makes them very attractive for industrial applications."
"Factors Associated With Knowledge, Perception, And Practice Toward Self-Care Among Elderly Patients Suffering From Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In Rural Thailand BACKGROUND: Globally, diabetes caused 4.6 million deaths during 2011 and burdened health care systems worldwide with $465 billion. The diabetes prevalence rate in Thailand has risen dramatically in recent years, from just 2.3% in 1991 to 6.9% in 2009. The objective of this study was to explore factors associated with knowledge, perception, and practice toward self-care among elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients aged 50-70 years.METHODS: A cross sectional study design was conducted by enrolling 140 aged people of both gender suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus and registered at three clinics of Primary healthcare at Taladnoi, Horathep, and Khokyai, Saraburi, Thailand. Participants whose age was 50-70 were rechecked through laboratory testing like Hba1c, FBS, and BMI were included. Data was analysed by using descriptive statistics and chi-square.RESULTS: The participants mean age was 62.11±0.59 years and 69.4% were female, 27.8% belonged to indigenous caste and 82.6% were married. About one-fourth of the participants were housewives, 15.2% government employee and 12.1% were farmer. Participants suffering from diabetes since1-5 years were 48.5%. Among the diabetic patients, 51.5% reported to have family history of diabetes. The mean knowledge score of the respondents was 3.61 (±1.80), perception was 4.34 (±1.41), practice was 12.14 (±4.47). A significant different existed between gender with Hba1c (<0.05), knowledge, and work status with Hba1c (<0.05)..CONCLUSIONS: Study concluded that the knowledge, perception, and practice about type 2 diabetes mellitus among patient were significantly poor. However, the factors like; gender, work and practice were found significantly correlated with glycated haemoglobin."
"Incidence and risk factors for venous thromboembolism in Thai hospitalized lymphoma patients  2017 Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, THAILAND.Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complica- tion in cancer patients. However, the magnitude of this problem in Thai hospitalized lymphoma patients has not been well studied. To identify the incidence and risk factors for VTE in those patients, retrospective and prospective cohort studies were conducted in lymphoma patients admitted to a medical school affiliated hospital. Patient profile and risk factors were recorded. Patients were followed up for 90 days after admission. A total of 469 patients were included, of which 422 patients identified from 2007 to 2011 from hospital electronic data base were in the retrospective cohort, and 47 patients enrolled during 6 months in 2012 were in the prospective cohort. Two patients in the retrospective cohort had unconfirmed VTE, and then were excluded. The incidences of VTE in the retrospective cohort and the prospective cohort were 3.6% and 8.5%, respectively (p=0.113). In the retrospective cohort, VTE rates in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients were 3.4% and 5.9%, respectively (p= 0.347). All VTEs in the prospective cohort were in NHL patients. Concerning time to VTE, all events occurred before starting or during the first 3 courses of chemotherapy. Upon multivariate analysis, the independent risk factor for VTE was being bedridden (adjusted odds ratio 6.21, 95% confidence interval 1.59 - 24.31). In conclusion, the incidence of VTE in Thai hospitalized lymphoma patients admitted for chemotherapy is high. This implies that VTE prophylaxis should be considered during the early courses of chemotherapy in bedridden lymphoma patients."
"Kiss1 mRNA and its protein distribution in preoptic and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei in pre-pubertal female swamp buffaloes  2018 PVJ.The relationship between kisspeptin and GnRH releasing in many species has been studied including post-pubertal buffalo, but not in pre-pubertal buffalo. The aims of this study were to detect the localization of Kiss1mRNA and the distribution of kisspeptin protein in the preoptic (POA) and arcuate (ARC) hypothalamic nuclei of pre-pubertal swamp buffaloes. Brains were collected from ten pre-pubertal female buffaloes ( < 1 year, 1-1.5 years, 1.5-2 years, 2-2.5 years and 2.5-3 years; two animals each age) and processed for paraffin blocks. Four-micron paraffin sections of the POA and ARC hypothalamic nuclei were prepared. The present research found evidence of Kiss1 mRNA in the cytoplasm of the neuronal soma and some small neuronal cells using the in-situ hybridization technique in all ten heifers. Using the immunohistochemistry technique, kisspeptin proteins expressed a weak intensity in the cellular process of neurons. The distribution of kisspeptin immunoreactions were found mainly in the POA hypothalamic nucleus in the juvenile group ( < 1 years) and only in the ARC area in the 1-2.5 years old pre-pubertal group. However, there was no kisspeptin reaction in both hypothalamic nuclei in the 2.5-3 years (peri-pubertal) group (P < 0.01). This study provides evidence of Kiss1 mRNA and kisspeptin protein in the hypothalamus of pre-pubertal buffaloes. This suggests that kisspeptin may be involved in reproductive development and may influence puberty onset in swamp buffalo heifers."
"An increasing electromechanical window is a predictive marker of ventricular fibrillation in anesthetized rabbit with ischemic heart  2018 Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science.The QTc interval is widely used in Safety Pharmacological studies to predict arrhythmia risk, and the electromechanical window (EMW) and short-term variability of QT intervals (STVQT) have been studied as new biomarkers for drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (TdP). However, the use of EMW and STVQT to predict ventricular fibrillation (VF) has not been elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate EMW and STVQT to predict VF in anesthetized rabbit model of VF. VF was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending and a descending branch of the left circumflex coronary arteries in a sample population of rabbits (n=18). VF was developed 55.6% (10/18). In rabbit with VF, the EMW was significantly higher than in rabbits without VF (96.3 ± 15.6 ms and 49.5 ± 5.6 ms, respectively, P<0.05). STVQT had significantly increased before the onset of VF in rabbits that experienced VF, but not in rabbits that did not experience VF (11.7 ± 1.8 ms and 3.7 ± 0.4 ms, respectively, P<0.05). The EMW and STVQT had better predictive power for VF with higher sensitivity and specificity than the QTc measure. The result suggested that the increasing of EMW, as well as the elevation of STVQT, can potentially be used as biomarkers for predicting of VF."
"Effect of Single-walled carbon nanotube catalysts on hydrothermal pretreatment of cellulose  2018 Japan Petroleum Institute. All rights reserved.Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were employed to obtain glucose from lignocellulose effectively via hydrothermal pretreatment. Hydrothermal pretreatment of eucalyptus and cellulose was conducted with and without SWCNT catalysts. SWCNT catalysts modified via oxidation and/or acid treatment were also applied. Oxidation treatment was conducted in the air at 500 °C for 30 min and acid treatment was conducted in the 96 % sulfuric acid for 18 h. Hydrothermal pretreatment was conducted using an 84 mL autoclave by heating samples that contained 0.6 g of cellulose to 200 °C with a heating rate of 4 °C/min and then cooling down at once. The initial SWCNTs were basic, and oxidation resulted in increased basicity. Acid treatment successfully increased the acid site density of the SWCNTs. The glucose yield increased with acid site density, showing the effectiveness of the acid-treated SWCNTs."
"Prognostic value of plasma EBV DNA for nasopharyngeal cancer patients during treatment with intensity-modulated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy  2018 Chawalit Lertbutsayanukul, Danita Kannarunimit, Anussara Prayongrat, Chakkapong Chakkabat, Sarin Kitpanit, Pokrath Hansasuta, published by Sciendo.Plasma EBV DNA concentrations at the time of diagnosis (pre-EBV) and post treatment (post-EBV) have significant value for predicting the clinical outcome of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients. However, the prognostic value of the EBV concentration during radiation therapy (mid-EBV) has not been vigorously studied. This was a post hoc analysis of 105 detectable pre-EBV NPC patients from a phase II/III study comparing sequential (SEQ) versus simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Plasma EBV DNA concentrations were measured by PCR before commencement of IMRT, at the 5th week of radiation therapy and 3 months after the completion of IMRT. The objective was to identify the prognostic value of mid-EBV to predict overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). A median pre-EBV was 6880 copies/ml. Mid-EBV and post-EBV were detectable in 14.3% and 6.7% of the patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 45.3 months. The 3-year OS, PFS and DMFS rates were 86.0% vs. 66.7% (p = 0.043), 81.5% vs. 52.5% (p = 0.006), 86.1% vs. 76.6% (p = 0.150), respectively, for those with undetectable mid-EBV vs. persistently detectable mid-EBV. However, in the multivariate analysis, only persistently detectable post-EBV was significantly associated with a worse OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 6.881, 95% confident interval (CI) 1.699-27.867, p = 0.007), PFS (HR = 5.117, 95% CI 1.562-16.768, p = 0.007) and DMFS (HR = 129.071, 95%CI 19.031-875.364, p < 0.001). Detectable post-EBV was the most powerful adverse prognostic factor for OS, PFS and DMFS; however, detectable mid-EBV was associated with worse OS, PFS especially Local-PFS (LPFS) and may facilitate adaptive treatment during the radiation treatment period."
"Porcine rotavirus C in pigs with gastroenteritis on Thai swine farms, 2011-2016  2018 Tuanthap et al.Swine are economically important food animals, but highly contagious porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and rotavirus can afflict pig herds and contribute significantly to piglet morbidity and mortality. While there have been studies on rotavirus group A (RVA) in Thailand, reports of rotavirus group C (RVC) are limited. Here, we aimed to identify the prevalence of RVC circulating on Thai commercial swine farms. We analyzed 769 feces and intestine mucosal contents of pigs affected with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016 using RT-PCR specific for the PEDV spike (S), rotavirus glycoprotein (G) VP7, and protease-sensitive protein (P) VP4 genes. We found that 6.6% (51/769) of samples tested positive for RVC, of which 11 samples were co-infected with RVA and four samples were co-infected with PEDV. Three samples tested positive for all three viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene showed that the most frequent RVC genotype was G1, which grouped with the prototypic RVC Cowden strain. While G6 and G9 were also common, G3 was relatively rare. Analysis of the VP4 gene revealed that the most common P type was P[5], followed by P[4], P[7], and P[1]. In all, there were six G/P combinations (G6P[5], G1P[1], G1P[4], G1P[5], G9P[4], and G9P[7]), of which G6P[5] was the most predominant."

"Preparation of porous cylindrical tubes substrates from zeolite and clay for TiO2 photocatalyst coating  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the one of photocatalyst materials that widely used for decolorization of organic compounds in wastewater by photocatalytic mechanism which can be activated by UV light. Unfortunately, in the case of fine TiO2 power, filtration of the powder after water treatment process is difficult. In this research, coating or immobilizing the TiO2 powder on substrates using as the materials for removing the color of lignin is interesting. The objectives of this research are to prepare the floating porous cylindrical tube substrates composed of zeolite NaA and ball clay, and then to determine the efficiency of lignin degradation. Zeolite NaA powder, Suratthani ball clay and organic binder solution were mixed before extruding and cutting to be 1.5 cm diameter cylindrical tube with 2.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in thickness. After that, the dried tubes were fired at 650 - 800 °C for 2 hours and were then coated with TiO2-P25 suspension before re-firing at 600 °C for 1 hour in an electrical furnace. The fired uncoated tubes were characterized in terms of phase composition, porosity and radial crush strength. From the XRD pattern of the tubes fired at 800 °C showed that the zeolite NaA phase was disappeared. On the other hand, the zeolite NaA phase was found in the samples fired at another lower temperature. For the coated tubes, polyurethane foam was filled into the hollow to make the tubes can be floated on the surface of water. After that, the photocatalyst degradation property by determining the decreasing of concentration of lignin solution under tungsten lamp irradiation of the floated tubes were tested."
"Microwave synthesis of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and the application in bio-composite  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.This research synthesized nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) via microwave assisted heating method. The morphology and crystallinity of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite were affected by heating power and pH of the mixed solution. Nanocrystalline HA was best obtained when synthesized at pH = 11. Crystal size increased and crystal shape changed from spherical to rod and plate-like when the microwave power was increased from 320 to 800 watts. The synthesized nano-HA could be fabricated into bio-composite films using poly lactic acid (PLA) as the matrix and solvent casting method was utilized. In-vitro study for bioactivity was carried out in the SBF solution which formed hydroxyl-carbonate apatite (HCA) layer on the PLA/nano HA composite surface. The layer thickness increased in the background with increasing soaking time in the SBF."
"Fabrication and characterization of low thermal expansion cordierite/spodumene/mullite composite ceramic for cookware  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Ceramic cookware can be taken a direct flame or stove top for the duration without damage. The selected materials must have low thermal expansion coefficient, high strength, low water absorption and high thermal shock resistance, reasonable in cost and easy to be produced. Cordierite and spodumene composite has been interested for ceramic cookware due to their fitted properties. In previous work, study in the cordierite-spodumene composite with low thermal expansion coefficient of 2.60 x 10-6 /oC when sintered at 1250oC with a ratio of spodumene 60 wt% and cordierite 40 wt% can withstand the pot shape samples. However, the sample showed relatively high water absorption and low strength which was not appropriate for using in this application. In this research, mullite is added in the formula to improve strength and densification of ceramic composites. Spodumene, ball clay, calcined talc and calcined alumina are used as starting raw materials and formed by slip casting. All samples are sintered in a temperature range from 1250-1275oC in an electric furnace. Water absorption and bulk density were tested by Archimedes method, modulus of rupture was tested by the three-point bending method, microstructure were investigated by SEM and the coefficient of thermal expansion was measured by dilatometer. It was found that the mullite phase was investigated when adding mullite more than 30 wt% in cordierite-spodumene composite."
"Effect of molten salts on synthesis and upconversion luminescence of ytterbium and thulium-doped alkaline yttrium fluorides  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Upconversion luminescence materials have recently received attentions because of their light conversion ability from infrared into visible and ultraviolet light. In this work, alkaline yttrium fluoride doped by ytterbium and thulium (AYF4: 20%Yb3+, 0.5%Tm3+) were synthesized by molten salt method at 400 °C for 2 hours with different eutectic molten salts, i.e. NaNO3-KNO3, NaNO3-LiNO3, KNO3-LiNO3, and NaNO3-KNO3-LiNO3. Pure hexagonal NaYF4 microrods were successfully synthesized using eutectic NaNO3-KNO3 molten salt. Under 980 nm laser diode excitation, upconversion luminescence in both visible and ultraviolet region was clearly observed. On the other hand, for the use of other eutectic molten salts containing LiNO3, the mixed phases of tetragonal LiYF4 and orthorhombic Y6O5F8 were obtained. These powders emitted only visible light with 10 times lower intensity than the hexagonal NaYF4 microrods synthesized using NaNO3-KNO3."
"Enhancing the phase conversion of hydroxyapatite from calcium sulphate hemihydrate by hydrothermal reaction  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) is a well-known biocompatible material which is widely used as bone graft in orthopedic and dental applications due to its chemical structure similar to that of human bone. In this study, we studied the feasibility of fabricating hydroxyapatite by hydrothermal conversion of calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO4•0.5H2O) based mixture. The spherical samples (7 mm in diameter) were three dimensionally printed and hydrothermally treated in 1M disodium hydrogenphosphate (Na2HPO4) at 100°C -180°C for 2-8 hrs. Phase analysis by X-ray diffraction indicated that monetite (CaHPO4) coexisted with hydroxyapatite when hydrothermally treating the samples at pH 9. However, when pH of disodium hydrogenphosphate was adjusted to pH 11, the samples were completely converted to hydroxyapatite without any structural destruction. Therefore, hydrothermal reaction could possibly be employed to enhance the phase conversion of hydroxyapatite in term of conversion rate compared to typical atmospheric conversion."
"Influence of lignite bottom ash on pyroplastic deformation of stoneware ceramic tiles  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Electricity generation at Mae Moh Power Plant in Lampang, Thailand, uses lignite as fuel. The output is 3.0 to 3.5 million tons of fly ash per year and 1.5 to 2.0 million tons of bottom ash per year. Fly ash is widely used in concrete application but for bottom ash, it is not very useful. When considering the phase of bottom ash containing quartz, anorthite and hematite, it was found that there are suitable chemical compositions for replacement of raw materials in ceramic tile. Generally, the stoneware tiles are composed of quartz, mullite, feldspar, and glass phase. Water absorption of stoneware ceramic tiles is below 5%, high strength, fire resistance, and low warpage. Firing or sintering at rather high temperature as 1000-1250oC is the manufacturing process for this type of tile. The changes in crystal structure and glassy phase formation in tile during sintering will be often result the tile to warpage or bent depends on the viscosity of the glassy phase that occurs at high temperatures. In the tile, if less viscosity will cause higher warping rate that effect on the shape, and quality of the workpiece. The research has reported that anorthite phase improves the viscosity of a liquid phase or glassy phase when the tile is sintering at high temperatures and lead to high density and low water absorption. This research is interested in studying the effect of using lignite bottom ash as an ingredient in ceramic tile texture to produce low water absorption type by analyzing the effect of percentage of lignite bottom ash to warpage and important properties of ceramic tiles."
"Feasibility study of using basalt fibers as the reinforcement phase in fiber-cement products  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The aim of this work was to study the feasibility of using basalt fibers as the reinforcement phase in fiber-cement products which was the fiber-reinforced construction materials used for roof, wall, ceiling, and floor applications. The feasibility study included (1) the alkaline resistant test of the basalt fibers by soaking the basalt fibers in 1 M Ca(OH)2 up to 28 days, and (2) the mechanical test based on ASTM C1185 standard on the fiber-cement boards that used basalt fibers as a reinforcement phase. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and x-ray diffractometer (XRD) were used to characterize the basalt fibers after alkaline resistant test. The basalt-fiber reinforced cement boards were produced on the industrial level by using Hatschek process. From the alkaline resistant test, basalt fibers had well alkaline resistant. From the mechanical test, the basalt-fiber reinforced cement boards passed the minimum mechanical requirement of TIS 1427-2540 and ASTM C1186 standard. Therefore, basalt fibers could be considered as a good candidate for using as a reinforcement phase in the fiber-cement products."
"Compressive strength and setting time modification of class C fly ash-based geopolymer partially replaced with kaolin and metakaolin  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Class C fly ash is widely used as a geopolymer raw material. It contains high calcium oxide and iron oxide resulting in a fast setting property. The influence of using kaolin and metakaolin replaced class C fly ash in geopolymer processing were investigated in term of compressive strength and setting time. Kaolin and metakaolin which calcined at different temperatures of 600°C and 700°C replaced Class C fly ash between 0 to 50 wt.%. The geopolymers were prepared at constant KOH concentration as 6.0 M, K2SiO3/KOH ratio as 1.0, solid/liquid ratio as 1.5 and 7 days of curing. The compressive strength is obviously increased when fly ash was replaced with both kinds of metakaolin, although, it is inclined to decrease when replaced by kaolin. The compressive strength is increased up to 13% and 47% with the replacement by 50 wt.% of metakaolin calcined at 600°C and 700°C, respectively. On the other hand, the replacement by 50 wt. % of kaolin give the initial setting time prolonging from about 6 min to 80 min. However, the initial setting time of metakaolin calcined at 600°C and 700°C replacement is also improved to about 37 min and 20 min, respectively. These results are from the different of amorphous phase and reactivity of the replacement materials. XRD analysis reveals the combination phases of amorphous geopolymer gel that is the broad hump centered at 28-30° 2θ, and products from the reaction such as calcium oxide, arcanite, calcium silicate hydrate, quartz and muscovite which the two latter are from unreacted metakaolin. They are confirmed by FT-IR result and microstructure evaluation by SEM. Therefore, the partially replacement of fly ash with kaolin and metakaolin in fly ash-based geopolymer production are affected to the compressive strength and the setting time."
"Micromorphology of porosity related to electrical resistance of dental luting cements  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The aim was to investigate the relation between micromorphology of porosity and electrical resistance of dental luting cements. Five dental luting cements were evaluated: zinc phosphate, glass ionomer, and three types of resin luting cements. Porosity of the specimen was analyzed by micro-CT and electrical resistance of cement was measured at voltage of 125 V up to 30 days and solubility of each specimen was calculated. It showed that the resin luting cements provided the highest electrical resistance regardless of amount of porosity. Zinc phosphate and glass ionomer had high porosity and the lowest resistance (14 and 3 kΩ, respectively). It was found that the electrical resistance of luting cement was not directly affected by the amount of porosity, but it seems to be related to pore connection. There is no correlation between electrical resistance and percentage of porosity but the morphology of porosity may have an influence on the electrical property of luting cement. Models of pore connection were proposed to explain the electrical resistance of luting cement."
"Effect of the addition of ZrSiO4 on alkali-resistance and liquidus temperature of basaltic glass  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Basalt fiber has been used as a reinforced material in cement-based materials because it has higher mechanical strength and cheaper than common silicate based glass-fibers. However, silicate-based glass fibers have low alkali resistance especially in cement matrix composite. In this work, we studied the improvement of alkali resistance by addition of zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4) in original basalt glass composition. The batch of basalt glass with additional ZrSiO4 contents of 0.00, 2.50, 5.00, 7.50 and 10.00 wt% were melted at 1500 °C. The liquidus temperature (TL) is important in for the fiber glass manufacturing. It need to formulate glass composition which requires a lower melting temperature and is crystallization resistant. TL as a function of composition is usually determined experimentally. In this study, glassy phase was determined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The glass transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization temperature (Tc) and TL were analyzed by Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). The results found that the addition of ZrSiO4 in a basalt glass batch increased Tg while Tc of each sample was closed to original basalt fiber. Moreover, the alkali resistance of these glasses increased with an increasing of ZrSiO4 content. However, excessive ZrSiO4 contents (7.50 and 10.00 wt%) resulted in crystallization of ZrO2 which separated from glassy phase."
"The adsorption of cadmium ions on fly ash based geopolymer particles  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Geopolymer particles from waste coal fly ash were prepared in order to investigate adsorption process of Cadmium ions. The aim of the study is to focus on factors which affect adsorption process of heavy metals on geopolymer materials. The raw fly ash was mixed with sodium hydroxide solution and sodium silicate solution. After that geopolymer was cured at 80oC for 24 hr. The sample was ground and washed until pH=7. The obtained geopolymer particles were dried at 60oC. The raw materials and geopolymer were characterized. The XRD results showed a highly amorphous structure in obtained geopolymer. The major components of waste coal fly ash and synthesized geopolymer were SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and CaO. The BET surface area of fly ash and geopolymer particles were 0.83 m2/g and 85.01 m2/g, respectively. The adsorption conditions (initial concentration from 10-120 mg/L, temperature at 25-45oC, pH of cadmium ions solution from 1-5, 0.02-0.14 g. of geopolymer and contact time for 5-180 min) were studied. From removal efficiency results, synthesized geopolymer had high removal capacity for cadmium ions (Cd2+). At pH 5 of solution, the highest Cd2+ removal capacity was obtained. In addition, the removal efficiency increases with an increasing geopolymer dosage, contact time and a decreasing of Cd2+ initial concentration. Moreover, both Langmuir and Freundlich models were investigated for studying adsorption isotherm. The result showed Langmuir model is more suitable for geopolymer adsorption of cadmium ion in aqueous solution than Freundlich model."
"Effect of aluminum hydroxide addition on properties of fired refractory clay brick  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The pottery of Ratchaburi is very famous especially dragon jar which was fired by using dragon kiln. The kiln was made of unfired clay bricks, which its properties including high refractoriness, low thermal shrinkage and durable are desired. Aluminum hydroxide is an interesting material for improving brick’s properties, providing high active alumina (gamma-alumina) content after decomposition, high melting point and also reasonable cost. The study evaluated the effect of an additive, Al(OH)3, on the fried properties of refractory clay brick. In this study, four difference proportions of Al(OH)3 to clay, including 0:100, 25:75, 49:51 and 76:24 were studied. The specimens of 5x5x5 cm3 were formed by hand molding, then were fired at 1200, 1300 and 1400 °C. The properties including refractoriness, volume shrinkage, strength, bulk density, water absorption, and slaking time were investigated. The samples of 25:75 ratio of Al(OH)3 to clay, which was fired at 1300oC exhibited high in refractoriness, low volume shrinkage of 5% and relatively low density of 1.69 g/cm3 as compared to those of 1400oC fired. Moreover, the moderate water adsorption of 15 % and useable compressive strength of 12.4 MPa was also observed. As a result, these properties suitable for using in firebox of dragon kiln of Ratchaburi province."
"Assessing risk of security non-compliance of banking security requirements based on attack patterns Copyright  2018, the Authors. Published by Atlantis Press.Information systems such as those in the Banking sector need to comply with security regulations to assure that necessary security controls are in place. This paper presents an initial risk assessment method to assist a banking information system project in validating security requirements of the system. Dissimilarity between the textual security requirements of the system and the security regulations is determined to identify security non-compliance. A risk index model is then proposed to determine the risk level based on the severity and likelihood of exploit of any security attack patterns that could potentially affect the system if the missing regulations are not implemented. In an experiment using a case study of nine Thai commercial banks and the IT Best Practices of the Bank of Thailand as the regulations, the performance of compliance checking is evaluated in terms of F-measure and accuracy. It is also found that there is a strong positive correlation, with the coefficient of over 0.6, between the risk indices from the method and the security expert judgment."
"Natural Origin Materials for Osteochondral Tissue Engineering  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.Materials selection is a critical aspect for the production of scaffolds for osteochondral tissue engineering. Synthetic materials are the result of man-made operations and have been investigated for a variety of tissue engineering applications. Instead, the products of physiological processes and the metabolic activity of living organisms are identified as natural materials. Over the recent decades, a number of natural materials, namely, biopolymers and bioceramics, have been proposed as the main constituent of osteochondral scaffolds, but also as cell carriers and signaling molecules. Overall, natural materials have been investigated both in the bone and in the cartilage compartment, sometimes alone, but often in combination with other biopolymers or synthetic materials. Biopolymers and bioceramics possess unique advantages over their synthetic counterparts due similarity with natural extracellular matrix, the presence of cell recognition sites and tunable chemistry. However, the characteristics of natural origin materials can vary considerably depending on the specific source and extraction process. A deeper understanding of the relationship between material variability and biological activity and the definition of standardized manufacturing procedures will be crucial for the future of natural materials in tissue engineering."
"Application of D-Amino Acids as Biofilm Dispersing Agent in Dental Unit Waterlines  2018 Ruchanee Salingcarnboriboon Ampornaramveth et al.Aim and Purpose. Biofilms in dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) are extremely difficult to eliminate. Aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a mixture of four D-amino acids on biofilm dispersion in DUWLs. Materials and Methods. A mixture of four D-amino acids (D-methionine, D-tryptophan, D-leucine, and D-tyrosine, 10 mM each), distilled water (control), and 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used in the experiment. In laboratory, pieces of DUWLs covered with biofilms were submerged in different solutions for 5 days, flushed, and measured OD600 of the dispersed biofilms. Remnants of biofilms on the DUWLs were evaluated by SEM. In clinic, fifteen DCUs were incubated with test and control solutions, flushed, and measured OD600 of the dispersed biofilms. Microbial count of DUWL output water was enumerated twice a week for four weeks. Results. There was a slight, but not significant, increase in OD600 of flushing water in D-amino acids group. D-amino acids effectively reduced bacterial plaque as demonstrated by SEM. Incubation with D-amino acids significantly reduced biofilms especially after the first day of flushing. Bacterial count in DUWL output water was significantly reduced after treatment with D-amino acids. Conclusion. D-amino acids are applicable as biofilm dispersing agents in DUWLs."
"Estimating Long-Term Care Costs among Thai Elderly: A Phichit Province Case Study  2018 Pattaraporn Khongboon and Sathirakorn Pongpanich.Background. Rural-urban inequality in long-term care (LTC) services has been increasing alongside rapid socioeconomic development. This study estimates the average spending on LTC services and identifies the factors that influence the use and cost of LTC for the elderly living in urban and rural areas of Thailand. Methods. The sample comprised 837 elderly aged 60 years drawn from rural and urban areas in Phichit Province. Costs were assessed over a 1-month period. Direct costs of caregiving and indirect costs (opportunity cost method) were analyzed. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine which factors affected LTC costs. Results. The total annual LTC spending for rural and urban residents was on average USD 7,285 and USD 7,280.6, respectively. Formal care and informal care comprise the largest share of payments. There was a significant association between rural residents and costs for informal care, day/night care, and home renovation. Conclusions. Even though total LTC expenditures do not seem to vary significantly across rural and urban areas, the fundamental differences between areas need to be recognized. Reorganizing country delivery systems and finding a balance between formal and informal care are alternative solutions."

Feminizing hormonal treatment leads to reductions in testicular germ cell levels. All transwomen should be warned about this consequence, and gamete preservation should be offered before starting hormonal treatment."
"Optimization of redispersible spray dried powder of chitosan coated solid lipid-based nanosystems  2018, International Journal of Drug Delivery Technology. All rights reserved.The present work describes the optimization of spray dried powder of solid lipid-based nanosystems to improve drug stability, surface modification and to obtain nanosystems after redispersion. Chitosan coated solid lipid nanoparticles containing bromocriptine mesylate (cBMSLN) were prepared by high pressure homogenization technique following by chitosan addition. For spray drying, response surface methodology with central composite rotatable design was to optimize 3 parameters: inlet temperature, pump rate and feed concentration. From regression analysis, powder yield, moisture content and size of redispersed nanoaggregates as responses were fitted well with linear, quadratic and quadratic equation models, respectively. Spherical powders with size of 4-5 μm and 70% yield were obtained at optimum parameters which were also used to prepare powder of chitosan coated nanostructured lipid carriers containing BM (cBMNLC). Amorphous characteristics were confirmed from powder XRD patterns and DSC chromatograms in all prepared powders. Redispersion of powders yielded nanosystems of some original nanosize and a greater portion of larger size. Smoother surface of NLC systems was observed, so was with chitosan coating. Drug entrapment was >85% but significantly decreased in chitosan coated formulations while drug retention after spray drying showed opposite results. After storage, spray dried powder could retain higher drug content than the original nanosystems. Obviously, NLC systems had better drug stability results than SLN systems. It could be concluded that redispersible spray dried powders of chitosan coated lipid-based nanosystems especially NLC systems were successfully obtained with surface modification, nanoaggregate size range and improved drug stability."

"Maintenance management for transportation process in quarry industry  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to enhance the capability in managing the maintenance of the transportation process from a quarry to a crushing plant, measured by the availability value and the process capability value. Design/methodology/approach: The maintenance management plan consists of plans for three levels of management: strategy, tactical and operational maintenance plans. The Deming cycle is a continuous improvement tool use for controlling and monitoring activities of the plans. There are three Deming cycles according to these plans, the first of which involves the improvement of machine performance and investment evaluation. The second involves the improvement of plans, schedule, and activities of preventive maintenance including autonomous maintenance. The third is for human resource development on maintenance works. Moreover, the feedback of a prior round of each cycle comes early to detect abnormalities that provide better capability in maintenance. Findings: Three Deming cycles can use for enhancing the maintenance management. The parameters are availability (A) of machines and the capability process (Cpk) of the transportation process. The results of this research state that the availability value of machines increases to 80-92 percent while the process capability value increases to 0.56. Practical implications: The maintenance management, especially strategic plan, tactical plan and operational plan via the Deming cycle, can be implemented in other medium-sized industries with limited technology and personnel. It was found that the implementation of the plans has continued to progress with the Deming cycle. Originality/value: This paper proposes how to successfully implement the maintenance management for medium-sized industries with limited technology and personnel. The maintenance management of three levels is carried out simultaneously by using the Deming cycle. This work has proven to be successful which can be expressed in the availability and the capability process values."
"Review on apiary management and antimicrobial compounds as alternative prevention or treatment for honeybee diseases  2018 Chanpen Chanchao, Marko Stoić, Mikio Yoshiyama and Kiyoshi Kimura.Honeybees are important in terms of pollinators and bee products. However, honeybee colonies keep declining due to colony collapse disorder, loss of food sources, environmental deterioration, pesticide exposure and various diseases, as well as the interaction of these causes. Pathogenic infections are high because there is an antagonistic coevolution between host and pathogen/parasite, which leads to a reciprocal adaptation, as well as the weakening of the immune system of the hosts by other (including the above mentioned) compounding factors. Since many antibiotics have been used in apiaries, there is growing public health concern about antibiotic residues in food, while the spread of antibiotic resistant isolates of pathogens is of concern. This review focusses on a management system for apiary hygiene and antimicrobial compounds from natural products. Important traits for apiary management are the habitat quality, landscape heterogeneity, climate, management and health. Successful management can be determined by many criteria, such as the level of honey production/harvesting, the diversity of honey types, disease control and pesticide accumulation. Furthermore, attention to land cover is important because it provides the quality and quantity of nutrients. High elevations and slopes can influence the bee health, as can human actions, including global trade and hobby bee keepers. In order to reduce the use of chemicals and antibiotics in apiaries, the use of alternative compounds from natural products are still required. Compounds inhibiting Paenibacillus larvae larvae, the cause of American foulbrood disease and Varroa mites are very challenging because the bacteria can produce resistant spores and the mites are vectors for many viruses and pathogens. Bee products and plants, both crude and purified forms, can be alternative sources for honeybee disease control. Several substances, like propolis, have already been applied in field experiments. Various crude extracts, volatile compounds and pure compounds appear to have potential in honeybee disease prevention and treatment. It is concluded that the apiary management system and use of suitable alternative compounds from natural products can improve the health and decrease the loss of honeybees."
"Theoretical aspects in structural distortion and the electronic properties of lithium peroxide under high pressure  2018 the Owner Societies.The structural phase transition and electronic properties of Li2O2 under pressures up to 500 GPa have been investigated using first-principles calculations. Two new structural phase transitions have been proposed at pressures around 75 GPa from the P63/mmc structure to the P21 structure and around 136 GPa from the P21 structure to the P21/c structure. The calculated phonon spectra have confirmed the dynamical stability of these structures. The pressure dependence of the lattice dynamics, O-O bond length, and band gaps in Li2O2 have also been reported. The band gaps of the P63/mmc, P21, and P21/c structures calculated by PBE and HSE06 have shown increasing trends with increasing pressure. Interestingly, the P63/mmc band gap and c/a ratio have significantly decreased with the increasing O-O bond length and ELF value around 11 and 40 GPa. At these pressures, the phonon frequency of the O-O stretching modes has softened. This finding reveals the effects of structural distortion in three phases of Li2O2. Our study provides structural understanding and the electronic properties of Li2O2 under high pressure, which might be useful for investigating the charge transport through Li2O2 in lithium-air batteries and CO2 capture."
"An observational study of the effect of hemoglobinopathy, alpha thalassemia and hemoglobin E on P. vivax parasitemia  Mediterranean Journal of Hematology and Infectious Diseases 2018.Background: The protective effect of a-thalassemia, a common hematological disorder in Southeast Asia, against Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been well established. However, there is much less understanding of the effect of a-thalassemia against P. vivax. Here, we aimed to investigate the proportion of a-thalassemia including the impact of a-thalassemia and HbE on the parasitemia of P. vivax in Southeast Asian malaria patients in Thailand. Methods: A total of 210 malaria patients, admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand during 2011-2012, consisting of 159 Myanmeses, 13 Karens, 26 Thais, 3 Mons, 3 Laotians, and 6 Cambodians were recruited. Plasmodium spp. and parasite densities were determined. Group of deletion mutation (--SEA, -α3.7, -α4.2deletion) and substitution mutation (HbCS and HbE) were genotyped using multiplex gap-PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. Results: In our malaria patients, 17/210 homozygous and 74/210 heterozygous -α3.7 deletion were found. Only 3/210 heterozygous -α4.2 and 2/210 heterozygous--SEA deletion were detected. HbE is frequently found with 6/210 homozygotes and 35/210 heterozygotes. The most common thalassemia allele frequencies in Myanmar population were -α3.7 deletion (0.282), followed by HbE (0.101), HbCS (0.013), -α4.2 deletion (0.009), and --SEA deletion (0.003). Only density of P. vivax in a-thalassemia trait patients (-α3.7/-α3.7, --SEA/αα, -α3.7/-α4.2) but not in silent a-thalassemia (-α3.7/αα, -α4.2/αα, ααCS/αα) were significantly higher compared with non-a-thalassemia patients (p=0.027). HbE did not affect P. vivax parasitemia. The density of P. falciparum significantly increased in heterozygous HbE patients (p=0.046). Conclusions: Alpha-thalassemia trait is associated with high levels of P. vivax parasitemia in malaria patients in Southeast Asia."
"Improvement of bending strength of resin coated sand  2018 Trans Tech Publications, SwitzerlandThis research proposed a method to improve bending strength of RCS used in hollow core production by finding the optimal levels of factors in the mixing process. Process factors under study were temperature of sand, time to release phenolic resin, time to release hexamine solution, time to start air blowing, air blowing time duration, and time to release calcium stearate. Experiments with Central Composite Face-centered (CCF) design were performed to save the number of experimental runs. Then, backward elimination regression analysis was performed to find out the relationship equation of bending strength and significant process factors. Next, the optimization technique was applied to determine the optimal setting of those significant process factors. The comfirmatory result showed that bending strength was significantly improved."
"Fabrication of lightweight concrete composites using natural fibers in Thailand  2018 Trans Tech Publications, SwitzerlandThis study developed lightweight concretes by using three different natural fibers from agricultural industries in Thailand which were corn husk fiber, bagasse fiber and coconut husk fiber. Low cost lightweight concretes in this study were fabricated using Ordinary Portland Cement type-1, coal fly ash, un-treated natural fibers and NaOH-treated natural fibers. The specimens were tested for bulk density, compressive strength, microstructure and deterioration. The result showed that the strongest concrete composite was obtained using 30 vol% fine coconut husk fiber in the concrete composition. The treated fibers showed an improvement in surface adhesion between cement matrix and fibers which resulted in higher compressive strength value."
"Effects of resin coated sand mixture on bending strength and cost  2018 Trans Tech Publications, SwitzerlandThis research proposed a method to find out the relationship between bending strength of resin coated sand and the proportion of different types of sand and resin. It was figured out that Central Composite Design (CCD) was suitable to be used to save the number of experimental runs. Then, backward elimination regression analysis was used to determine the relationship equation of bending strength and proportion of different types of sand and resin. Next, optimization technique was applied to determine the optimal new setting, which provided any targeted level of bending strength with the minimal total cost of sand and resin. The results showed that the experimental results obtained from the CCD experiments provided the regression model, which had less than 6% error from the actual bending strength value. With this proposed method the total cost of sand and resin was reduced by 28.6% on average and it also provided the bending strength on any required target level."
"Tryptophan catabolites along the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase pathway as a biological link between depression and cancer  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Both depression and cancer are related to a dysregulation of inflammatory and immune pathways. Indeed, depression is associated with increased expression of interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-α). In contrast, reductions of the activity of major histocompatibility complex protein molecules - class I and class II and natural killer cells are also observed. Similarly, cancers present elevated levels of TNF-α, reduced major histocompatibility complex class I and II, and natural killer cells. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway, is induced by interferon-γ, interleukin-6, TNF-α, and oxidative stress. IDO catabolizes tryptophan, the amino acid precursor of serotonin and melatonin, to the metabolites collectively called TRYCATs. TRYCAT pathway activation is accompanied by downregulation of immune cell proliferation, function, and survival. The increase in IDO activity in tumor microenvironments is related to tumor cell escape from immune surveillance. Despite the evidence of inflammatory mechanisms underlying cancer and depression, it is important to emphasize that both diseases are heterogeneous and, as such, inflammatory mechanisms may not be relevant to all patients. Thus, the purpose of this review is to examine whether detrimental TRYCATs - synthesis of which increases in depression and cancer - are a pathophysiological link between the two diseases, and whether IDO is a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of the comorbid depression and cancer."
"Cross-border power trade with Myanmar: Barriers and their removal from the Thai's perspective Copyright  2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.How can we remove barriers regarding the cross-border electric power trade between Myanmar and Thailand for the promotion of power integration? While Myanmar has traded electricity with China, the bilateral power trade with Thailand has made little progress. Taking some cases such as Dawei, through stakeholder meetings and focus group interviews, using the frameworks derived from a UN literature survey, we have identified the characteristics of distinctive barriers related to fuel types. While coal-fired power projects tend to experience more issues related to economic barriers, hydropower projects are likely to face social barriers, often interrelated with environmental issues. As both barriers are embedded within insufficient legal arrangements, legal technical assistances are crucially required."
"Acute effect of different normobaric hypoxic conditions on shuttle repeated sprint performance in futsal players  JPES.This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of different environmental oxygen conditions on shuttle repeated sprint performance in futsal players. Using a counterbalanced design, 16 male university-level futsal players performed 3 sets of shuttle repeated sprints (6 × 10 s) over a 5m distance with 20 s active rest between reps and 5 min active rest between sets. Participants completed 4 trials in a random order over 4 weeks with different inspired oxygen fractions for each trial (FIO2 = 20.9%, 14.5%, 13.5% and 12.5%). Electromyography (RMSEMG) data was recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle during sprinting. The number of completed shuttles in each 10 s period, blood lactate concentration, rating of perceived exertion, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and cardiorespiratory variables were recorded after each set. We found that after set3, blood lactate concentration was substantially higher (p <0.05) in the 12.5% FIO2 (10.4 ± 2.1 mmol/L) compared to normoxia, 14.5% or 13.5% condition (5.0 ± 1.6, 7.8 ± 1.5, and 9.4 ± 1.9 mmol/L, respectively). Compared to normoxia, the RMSEMG signal was 34.1% lower in the 12.5% condition, 14.1% and 18.6% lower in the 14.5% and 13.5% oxygen condition respectively. Moreover, SpO2 after set3 was substantially lower (p <0.05) in 12.5% (73.7 ± 3.4%) compared to normoxia, 14.5% or 13.5% condition (95.1 ± 1.8, 81.1 ± 2.1, and 79.1 ± 2.4%, respectively). Overall the lower FIO2 conditions produced lower in number of sprints, and highest heart rate, ventilation and rating of perceived exertion levels. In conclusion, FIO2 13.5% is an appropriate choice for shuttle repeated sprint training in hypoxia. Although, FIO2 13.5% was lower in benefitcial responses than FIO2 12.5% but FIO2 12.5% might produce unnecessary and unwanted fatigue from insufficient oxygen to athletes."
"Genetic diversity of green peafowl (Pavo muticus) in northern Thailand based on mitochondrial DNA control region sequences  2018 by Chulalongkorn University.The population size of green peafowl (Pavo muticus L.) has declined dramatically in Thailand. It is currently found in two geographically isolated regions in the northern and western areas. Here, we assessed the level of genetic variation of this endangered bird species to examine the influence of habitat fragmentation. We collected moulted feather and egg specimens of wild individuals from three populations in the North: Wiang Lor Wildlife Sanctuary (WLO-1 and WLO-2) and Tappaya Lor Non-Hunting Area (TPL). Mitochondrial control region sequences were obtained and analyzed. The results revealed that P. muticus in all populations showed a high level of haplotype diversity (0.784, n = 72), implying high genetic diversity. The haplotype diversity in WLO-1 population was higher than in other two populations. On phylogenetic trees and a haplotype network, the haplotypes of P. muticus individuals did not form a separate cluster, regardless of their distribution ranges, and three haplotypes were found in the three populations. By combining the present results with the previous data, our genetic investigations revealed that P. muticus populations in Thailand exhibited a low genetic difference (4.31%) between the two regional populations with no statistical significance. This suggests that there is no subdivision of wild populations."
"C8-Guanine modifications: Effect on Z-DNA formation and its role in cancer  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Base modifications are known to affect the structure and function of DNA. C8-guanine adducts from various carcinogenic compounds have been shown to be potent Z-DNA inducers. Hence, it has been hypothesized that Z-DNA plays a role in cancer and other genetic diseases. In this comprehensive review, Z-DNA and the effect of prevalent C8-guanine adducts on the B-Z transition are addressed. The discoveries of Z-DNA binding proteins including ADAR1, E3L, DLM1, and PKZ have suggested the relevance of Z-DNA in living systems. In addition, increasing evidence on the Z-DNA connection to gene transcription and inhibition reveals potential biological functions of the left-handed DNA. Finally, C8-guanine adducts that promote Z-DNA formation can be used as a tool to explore the Z-DNA function and its role in carcinogenesis."
"Effect of pretreatment atmosphere of WOx/SiO2 catalysts on metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene to propylene  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.The effect of a gas pretreatment atmosphere (pure N2, pure H2 and mixed H2/N2) on the metathesis reaction between ethylene and 2-butene to propylene over calcined and non-calcined WO3/SiO2 catalysts was investigated. The non-calcined catalysts exhibited higher activity than the calcined catalysts under different gas pretreatment atmospheres. The non-calcined catalyst with the use of pure H2 pretreatment showed the highest catalytic performances. As revealed by various characterization results from N2 physisorption, XRD, XPS, TEM, SEM-EDX, UV-Vis, Raman, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD techniques, the WO2.83 phase occurring from the H2 pretreatment of the non-calcined catalyst played an important role on the high activity of the catalyst. In addition, better tungsten dispersion, higher isolated surface tetrahedral tungsten oxide species, and W5+ species were obtained on the H2-Treated non-calcined WO3/SiO2 catalyst."

"Reliability and validity of foot function index thai version [FFI-TH]  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To assess the reliability and validity of Foot Function Index Thai version [FFI-TH]. Materials and Methods: The cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in patients with painful foot/ankle problems at Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Foot Function Index [FFI] is a self-administered patient-reported outcomes [PRO] measure for evaluating foot/ankle problems. It comprises three domains including pain, disability, and activity limitation. It was translated into Thai language using internationally recognized translation standards. Internal consistency reliability coefficients and coefficient of stability were calculated to test for reliability. The average test-retest interval was 3.90 days. Construct validity was evaluated by the Pain Visual Analogue Score [VAS-pain], the Visual Analogue Scale Foot and Ankle Thai version [VASFA-TH], and the Medical Outcomes Study [MOS] 36-item short form Thai version [SF36-TH]. Results: Ninety-seven patients were enrolled. Most participants were female (80.47%), with an average age of 45.74 years and an education level of at least bachelor’s degree (81.40%). The most common diagnoses were plantar fasciitis, ankle sprain, and hallux valgus. Median time to onset of problem was 5.5 months. Three domains revealed Cronbach’s alpha coefficient values, as follows, pain subscale (0.94), disability subscale (0.96), and activity limitation subscale (0.72). Intraclass correlation coefficient as 0.92 indicated high stability. Construct validity demonstrated significant correlation between the total and subscale of FFI-TH scores when compared to VAS-pain and SF36-TH for bodily pain, as determined by moderate correlation from Pearson’s correlation coefficients that ranged from 0.5 to 0.7. Average time to complete the FFI-TH was 4.67 minutes. A higher level of impairment will correspond with and result in a higher FFI score. Conclusion: FFI-TH demonstrated good reliability and validity with appropriate completing time. FFI-TH is suitable to be one of the Thai PRO measures that provide clinical benefit for patients with painful foot/ankle problems."
"Pattern of methamphetamine use and the time lag to methamphetamine dependence Copyright  2017 American Society of Addiction Medicine.Objectives: Use of methamphetamine (MA) commonly co-occurs with the use of other substances. The present study aims to examine substance initiation patterns of other substances, including alcohol, nicotine, inhalants, and cannabis (OTH), in MA users and its consequence on the time lag of MA dependence. Methods: Sociodemographic, environmental, and clinical data were obtained from MA users at a Thai substance treatment center. The Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism was employed to diagnose drug dependence. Results: Of 991 MA users, 52.6% were males, and the average age was 26.8±7.1 years. The mean age of first MA use (18 years) was greater than the mean age of first use of alcohol (17 years), nicotine (16 years), and inhalants (15 years) (P<0.001), but was comparable with the mean age at the first use of cannabis (P>0.05). Family history of MA use and nicotine dependence were associated with early MA onset. Participants who used MA as their first drug (MA>OTH) were more likely to be female and less likely to smoke intensely and to be exposed to severe traumatic events than those who used MA later than other substances (OTH>MA). The time lag from age at onset of MA use to MA dependence was shorter in OTH>MA than in MA>OTH (3 vs 5 years; χ 2 =5.7, P=0.02, log-rank test). Conclusions: A higher proportion of women was observed in MA>OTH than in OTH>MA. The use of other substances before MA increases the individual's vulnerability in shortening the interval between age at onset of MA use and MA dependence in a substance treatment cohort."
"Periostin staining within renal tissues from iga nephropathy patients  2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.Periostin is a novel biomarker related to kidney disease progression. The aim of this study was to examine the level of periostin staining within renal tissue from IgA nephropathy patients. Immunohistochemistry for periostin was performed. The score of periostin staining and the correlation of periostin staining score with each pathological feature were evaluated. Positive periostin staining was found in renal tissue from IgA nephropathy patients including glomerular, interstitial, vascular and tubular areas. Tubular epithelial cell staining, tubular cell cast staining and periglomerular staining were common histologic features positive for periostin. Periglomerular staining were correlated with interstitial fibrosis as well as with tubular epithelial cell staining. In addition, tubular cell cast staining were correlated with tubular epithelial cell staining as well as with tubular atrophy staining. We concluded that periostin may be a promising biomarker in IgA nephropathy patients."
"Validation of the thai version of the marital commitment scale (MCS)  2017, Mahidol University, Institute for Population and Social Research.The Marital Commitment Scale (MCS) developed by Johnson, Caughlin, and Huston (1999) is a widely-used instrument for assessing relationship commitment in a population. Although this scale has been used in the United States, there has been no study on its applicability in Asia. Therefore, this study developed a Thai version of the MCS (MCS-Thai) and recruited 394 adults in Thailand as sample. The validity and reliability of the MCS-Thai were examined and found to be compatible with the original version. The results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis indicated that three-factor structure (personal, moral, and structural commitment) to study relationship commitment was compatible with the conceptualization of marital commitment in the US and Thailand. However, the homogeneity of the sample (married individuals) limits the generalizability of these findings."
"Employee retention: the effects of internal branding and brand attitudes in sales organizations  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships among internal branding, brand orientation, brand identification, brand commitment, and employees’ intention to stay. The paper also examines the mediating roles played by brand identification and brand commitment on the relationship between brand orientation and retention. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 702 business-to-business salespeople working in 15 cement and building materials companies in Thailand. Hypotheses were tested and analyzed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and a bootstrapping procedure. Findings: The results revealed that establishing an internal brand has a positive effect on brand orientation, which has a positive impact on brand attitudes, namely brand commitment and brand identification. Such attitudes in turn are positively related to employee retention. The direct relationship between brand orientation and intention to stay was found to be partially mediated by brand identification. Research limitations/implications: The current research took place among customer-facing staff (e.g. salespeople), which can be extended to back-end employees in order to better reflect the overall internal branding effort. Practical implications: Organizations may improve employee retention through an internal branding process, and internalization of brand attitudes. Such efforts are not only the job of brand managers, but a shared responsibility of all employees at all levels. The collaboration between brand management and human resource (HR) interventions is crucial to successfully implement these efforts. Originality/value: This study extends the existing knowledge by investigating the relationships that have rarely been discussed in the HR management and employee retention literatures. It shows the importance of a brand-building mechanism at the cultural level, and the influential effect of brand attitudes on the turnover of salespeople."
"The moderating effects of demographic characteristics and certain psychological factors on the job embeddedness – turnover relationship among Thai health-care employees  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the roles of demographic characteristics (i.e. generations and organizational tenure) and psychological factors (i.e. leader-member exchange and self-efficacy) as moderators of the relationship between job embeddedness and turnover intention, and the mediating effect of turnover intention between job embeddedness and actual turnover. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 422 health-care workers through a questionnaire survey and analyzed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical regression. Findings: The results reveal that less embedded employees who perceive a lower level of leader–member exchange quality are more likely to indicate an intention to leave. The negative relationship between job embeddedness and turnover intention is stronger among less embedded employees with high self-efficacy. The finding also indicates that turnover intention plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between job embeddedness and actual turnover. Research limitations/implications: The current research took place within two health-care organizations. Replicating the study in a variety of industries, professions or cultures would be useful for the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Organizations may improve their retention of employees by nurturing the leader–member exchange relationship to enhance a social web that bonds them together. Managers may need to pay attention to making a greater effort to embed individuals in their jobs, so that they are better able to cope successfully with challenges and organize the workday to accommodate them. Originality/value: This study examines the moderating roles of individual characteristics and psychological factors on the relationship between job embeddedness and turnover intention, which has not been extensively investigated in the literature."

Their structures were elucidated using one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic methods and comparison with the literature. The ability of 1-4 to promote the migration of CCD-1064sk fibroblasts into a scratch-wound area was evaluated. The results indicated that juglanin (1) and nicotiflorin (3) significantly increased the migration of these cells and, hence, supporting the wound healing effect of flavonol glycosides."
"A cross-sectional study on intestinal parasitic infections in children in suburban public primary schools, Saraburi, the central region of Thailand Copyright  2018 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.Intestinal parasitic infection rate among school-aged children in Thailand has been decreasing. However, certain intestinal parasites remain problematic in some regions. This cross-sectional study was conducted between February and September 2016 in three suburban government primary schools (KK, BR, and HK), Saraburi, Thailand. Stool was collected from 263 asymptomatic subjects (4-15 years old), using simple direct smear, formalin-ether concentration, Boeck and Drbohlav’s Locke-Egg-Serum (LES) medium culture, and agar plate culture. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data about lifestyle and socioeconomic status. The overall rate of intestinal parasites was 22.1% (15.6% single infection and 6.5% multiple infections). The helminths involving the digestive system found were Strongyloides stercoralis (1.5%) and Opisthorchis viverrini (0.4%). For protozoan infection, the major cause was Blastocystis hominis (17.5%). The other protozoa included Endolimax nana (4.6%), Entamoeba coli (3.4%), Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (1.1%), and Giardia intestinalis (0.8%). The sensitivity for the detection of B. hominis increased with the LES culture technique. The infection rate of each organism was not significantly different among the three schools except for B. hominis which showed the highest prevalence in the HK school (P = 0.001). This was correlated with the questionnaire results in which the HK school showed the highest risk of drinking contaminated water (P = 0.004). The present study emphasized the persistent problems of protozoan infections among suburban school-aged children. Lifestyle was still an important factor for intestinal parasitic infections among suburban school-aged Thai children in this study. Health education as well as routine surveillance was necessary to control the infections."
"Identification of UT-A1- and AQP2-interacting proteins in rat inner medullary collecting duct  2018 American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.The urea channel UT-A1 and the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) mediate vasopressin-regulated transport in the renal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). To identify the proteins that interact with UT-A1 and AQP2 in native rat IMCD cells, we carried out chemical cross-linking followed by detergent solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and LC-MS/MS analysis of the immunoprecipitated material. The analyses revealed 133 UT-A1-interacting proteins and 139 AQP2-interacting proteins, each identified in multiple replicates. Fifty-three proteins that were present in both the UT-A1 and the AQP2 interactomes can be considered as mediators of housekeeping interactions, likely common to all plasma membrane proteins. Among proteins unique to the UT-A1 list were those involved in posttranslational modifications: phosphorylation (protein kinases Cdc42bpb, Phkb, Camk2d, and Mtor), ubiquitylation/ deubiquitylation (Uba1, Usp9x), and neddylation (Nae1 and Uba3). Among the proteins unique to the AQP2 list were several Rab proteins (Rab1a, Rab2a, Rab5b, Rab5c, Rab7a, Rab11a, Rab11b, Rab14, Rab17) involved in membrane trafficking. UT-A1 was found to interact with UT-A3, although quantitative proteomics revealed that most UT-A1 molecules in the cell are not bound to UT-A3. In vitro incubation of UT-A1 peptides with the protein kinases identified in the UT-A1 interactome revealed that all except Mtor were capable of phosphorylating known sites in UT-A1. Overall, the UT-A1 and AQP2 interactomes provide a snapshot of a dynamic process in which UT-A1 and AQP2 are produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, processed through the Golgi apparatus, delivered to endosomes that move into and out of the plasma membrane, and are regulated in the plasma membrane."
"Mulberry leaves and their potential effects against cardiometabolic risks: A review of chemical compositions, biological properties and clinical efficacy  2018 The Author(s).Context: Cardiometabolic risks are regarded as the crucial factors associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Regarding an increased attention to medicinal plants in the current healthcare system, the effects of mulberry (Morus spp., Moraceae) leaves on cardiometabolic risks have been consecutively considered in scientific research. Objective: The present review compiles and summarizes the chemical compositions, biological properties and clinical efficacy of mulberry leaves that are related to the amelioration of cardiometabolic risks. Methods: Published English literature from the PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar databases was searched by using ‘mulberry leaves’ ‘Morus spp.', ‘hyperglycemia’, ‘hyperlipidemia’, ‘obesity’, ‘hypertension’, ‘oxidative stress’, ‘atherosclerosis’ and ‘cardiovascular diseases’ as the keywords. The relevant articles published over the past two decades were identified and reviewed. Results: Mulberry leaves contain numerous chemical constituents. 1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), phenolics and flavonoids are the prominent functional compounds. Preclinical and clinical studies showed that mulberry leaves possessed various beneficial effects against cardiometabolic risks, including antihyperglycaemic, antihyperlipidaemic, antiobesity, antihypertensive, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic and cardioprotective effects. Conclusions: Mulberry leaves could be a promising therapeutic option for modulating cardiometabolic risks. However, further investigations should be performed to substantiate the potential of mulberry leaves in practical uses."
"Deep approach to learning of pharmacy students: A multilevel analysis  2018 FIP.Introduction: A deep approach to learning (DAL) is a critical foundation for enhancing pharmacy students’ academic performance and professional outcomes. This study at two universities in Thailand examined student-level and course-level factors affecting pharmacy students’ DAL using the Biggs 3P model as a theoretical framework. Methods: The measurement focused on DAL, achievement goal orientation, learning environment, appropriate workload, and assessment was sent to all 733 pharmacy students. Eight to twelve students were randomly selected to evaluate one of the 67 first semester courses available at two universities. Multilevel Structural Equation Modelling was used for analysis. Results: There were 733 questionnaires returned of which 536 were used. Mastery approach goal (β=0.536**), performance approach goal (β=0.039**), innovation (β=0.409**), appropriate workload (β=0.349**), and task orientation (β=0.201**) had positive significant relationships with the DAL in pharmacy students. Conclusion: Educators should increase innovative teaching approaches, optimise students’ workload, provide task orientation, and encourage students to be goal striving persons to facilitate deep learning."
"Robust Scale-Invariant Normalization and Similarity Measurement for Time Series Data  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.Classification is one of the most prevalent tasks in time series mining. Dynamic Time Warping and Longest Common Subsequence are well-known and widely used algorithms to measure similarity between two time series sequences using non-linear alignment. However, these algorithms work at its best when the time series pair has similar amplitude scaling, as a little adjustment of scale can actually double the error rates. Unfortunately, sensor data and most real-world time series data usually contain noise, missing values, outlier, and variability or scaling in both axes, which is not suitable for the widely used Z-normalization. We introduce the Local Feature Normalization (LFN) and its Local Scaling Feature (LSF), which can be used to robustly normalize noisy/warped/missing-valued time series. In addition, we utilize LSF to match time series containing multiple subsequences with a variety of scales; this algorithm is called Longest Common Local Scaling Feature (LCSF). Comparing to the usage of Z-normalized data, our classification results show that our proposed LFN is impressively robust, especially on high-error and noisy datasets. On both synthetic and real application data for wrist strengthening rehabilitation exercise using a mobile phone sensor, our LCSF similarity measure also significantly outperforms other existing methods by a large margin."
"Design and development of SECI and moodle online learning systems to enhance thinking and innovation skills for higher education learners  2018, Kassel University Press GmbH.This study aimed to design and develop an online learning system to enhance thinking and innovation skills for higher education learners. The objectives were to (1) design a system diagram, system architecture and functional structure for online learning framed by the SECI process (Socialization, Externalization, Combination and Internalization) and Moodle, (2) develop an online learning management system (LMS) with a new plug-in using Moodle, and (3) evaluate system suitability for the development of students' thinking and innovation skills. The research methodology was developed using a literature review to identify core components, focus group interviews to verify the process, software development by Moodle LMS, and assessments to measure learning outcome. Research instruments consisted of interview questions, Moodle LMS, and a self-assessment questionnaire. Assessment data was evaluated through pre-test and post-test analysis. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-test scores in both thinking and innovation skills, with the post-test score higher than pre-test score at a 0.01 level of significance. Findings revealed that online learning systems had a positive influence on students' thinking and innovation skills."
"Association of the S267F variant on NTCP gene and treatment response to pegylated interferon in patients with chronic hepatitis B: A multicentre study 2018 International Medical Press.Background: Sodium taurocholate co-Transporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a cell receptor for HBV. The S267F variant on the NTCP gene is inversely associated with the chronicity of HBV infection, progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in East Asian populations. The aim of this study was to determine whether the S267F variant was associated with response to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) in patients with chronic HBV infection. Methods: A total of 257 patients with chronic HBV, treated with PEG-IFN for 48 weeks, were identified from 13 tertiary hospitals included in the hepatitis B database of the Thai Association for the Study of the Liver (THASL). Results: Of these, 202 patients were infected with HBV genotype C (84.9%); 146 patients were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive (56.8%). Genotypic frequencies of the S267F polymorphism were 85.2%, 14.8% and 0% for the GG, GA and AA genotypes, respectively. S267F GA was associated with sustained alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization (OR = 3.25, 95% CI 1.23, 8.61; P=0.02) in HBeAg-positive patients. Patients with S267F variant tended to have more virological response, sustained response with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss at 24 weeks following PEG-IFN treatment. There was no association between the S267F variant and improved patient outcomes in HBeAg-negative patients. Conclusions: The S267F variant on the NTCP gene is independently associated with sustained normalization of ALT following treatment with PEG-IFN in patients with HBV infection who are HBeAg-positive. The findings of this study provide additional support for the clinical significance of the S267F variant of NTCP beyond HBV entry."
"Low heat input welding of nickel superalloy GTD-111 with Inconel 625 filler metal  Carl Hanser Verlag, München.GTD-111 precipitation-strengthened nickel-based superalloy is widely used in blades of gas turbine engines which operate at high temperature and in a hot localized corrosion atmosphere. After long-term exposure to high temperature, γ' precipitate is known to exhibit catastrophic changes in size and distribution which cause deterioration of its properties and failure of the component. In this study, a damaged blade removed froma land-based gas turbine generator was subjected to nonpreheat- treated GTAW and laser welding repair with various welding powers in the range of 135 to 295 J × mm-1, followed by post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) at 1473 K for 7200 s and strain aging at 1118 K for 86 400 s. Results show no significant relationship between welding powers, size and area fraction of the γ' precipitate in the fcc γ matrix in both GTAW and laser-welded specimens. The final γ' precipitate size and distribution depend mainly on PWHT parameters as γ' precipitates in all GTAW and laser welded specimens showed similar size and area fraction independently of the heat input from welding. Unmixed zones are observed in all laser welding specimens which may cause preferential weld corrosion during service. Microcrack occurrence due to welding and PWHT processes is also discussed."
"Bacillus subtilis N3 as a biocontrol agent for Curvularia lunata and its antifungal protein properties  2018 Friends Science Publishers.Bacillus subtilis N3 was able to inhibit the growth of Curvularia lunata, the causal agent of flower rusty spot disease in orchids. The optimal condition for this strain to produce the highest amount of antifungal compound was to culture the bacteria in tryptic soy broth (pH 6.0) at 37°C for 21 h. The active compound in the culture filtrate was stable for at least 20 min at pH 2 to 10 and at 20 to 121°C. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the culture filtrate was determined to be 7.81 μg/mL. Ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by anion exchange column chromatography revealed an approximate 600-fold increase in purification with 7,700 AU/mg of antifungal activity. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the molecular weight of the purified protein was about 39.88 kDa. Protein fingerprinting by LC/QTOF-MS-MS and the Mascot search algorithm revealed that it was highly similar to flagellin A protein of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens at the coverage of 69%. The purified protein was able to delay conidial germination and induce abnormal germ tube elongation of C. lunata. The bacterial isolate and/or their proteins show potential for use in sustainable agriculture. This is the first report showing that a flagellin-like protein is able to inhibit the growth of C. lunata."
"Facile synthesis of a ZnO-BiOI p-n nano-heterojunction with excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity  2018 Zhang et al.In this paper, an efficient method to produce a ZnO/BiOI nano-heterojunction is developed by a facile solution method followed by calcination. By tuning the ratio of Zn/Bi, the morphology varies from nanoplates, flowers to nanoparticles. The heterojunction formed between ZnO and BiOI decreases the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers and enhances the photocatalytic activity of ZnO/BiOI composites. The obtained ZnO/BiOI heterostructured nanocomposites exhibit a significant improvement in the photodegradation of rhodamine B under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation as compared to single-phase ZnO and BiOI. A sample with a Zn/Bi ratio of 3:1 showed the highest photocatalytic activity (≈99.3% after 100 min irradiation). The photodegradation tests indicated that the ZnO/BiOI heterostructured nanocomposites not only exhibit remarkably enhanced and sustainable photocatalytic activity, but also show good recyclability. The excellent photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the high separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs as well as the high specific area."
"Differences in Optic Nerve Head, Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer, and Ganglion Cell Complex Parameters Between Caucasian and Chinese Subjects Copyright  2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Purpose: To compare optic nerve head, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), and ganglion cell complex (GCC) parameters between Caucasian and ethnic Chinese. Materials and Methods: Normal subjects above 40 years old and self-identified as being Caucasian and Chinese were recruited. They were evaluated with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (RTVue-100). Parameters related to the optic nerve head, pRNFL, and GCC analysis protocols were acquired. Multivariable linear regression was performed adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Data from 116 Caucasian and 130 Chinese subjects were available for analysis. Mean age of all participants was 66.72 (SD 10.82) years. There were statistically significant differences for disc area (DA), area cup-to-disc, vertical cup-to-disc, and cup volume (P=0.02, 0.004, 0.02, and 0.03, respectively), greater in Chinese. After adjusting for age, sex, axial length (AL), intraocular pressure (IOP), DA, and GCC thickness, Chinese subjects had significantly greater thickness in all pRNFL parameters (mean differences ranged between 4.29 and 9.93 μm; all P<0.001) except the nasal quadrant. GCC outcomes were also adjusted for DA and pRNFL; Caucasians had significantly higher average GCC and inferior GCC (mean difference 2.97 and 3.45 μm, respectively; P<0.01), whereas the Chinese group had significantly higher ganglion cell global loss volume (mean difference 2.47 %, P<0.001). Conclusions: This study suggests there is significantly greater pRNFL thickness in Chinese, which were independent of age, AL, IOP, and DA, and possibly greater GCC in Caucasians after adjustment for age, AL, IOP, DA, and pRNFL thickness."
"Glomerular Filtration Rates in Asians  2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recommended the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for the classification of CKD, but its accuracy was limited to North American patients with estimated GFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area of European (White) or African (Black) descent. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) developed another equation for estimating GFR, derived from a population that included both participants without kidney disease and with CKD. But many ethnicities were inadequately represented. The International Society of Nephrology, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes committee promulgated clinical practice guidelines, which recommended the CKD-EPI equation. Investigators in Asia subsequently assessed the performance of these GFR estimating equations—the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation, the CKD-EPI equation (creatinine only), and the CKD-EPI equations (creatinine and cystatin C). In this review, we summarize the studies performed in Asia on validating or establishing new Asian ethnicity GFR estimating equations. We included both prospective and retrospective studies which used serum markers traceable to reference materials and focused the review of the performance of GFR estimation by comparisons with the GFR estimations obtained from the CKD-EPI equations."
"Association between HLA-B Alleles and Carbamazepine-Induced Maculopapular Exanthema and Severe Cutaneous Reactions in Thai Patients  2018 Chonlaphat Sukasem et al.The HLA-B∗15:02 allele has been reported to have a strong association with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) in Thai patients. The HLA-B alleles associated with carbamazepine-induced maculopapular exanthema (MPE) and the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) among the Thai population have never been reported. The aim of the present study was to carry out an analysis of the involvement of HLA-B alleles in carbamazepine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) in the Thai population. A case-control study was performed by genotyping the HLA-B alleles of Thai carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reaction patients (17 MPE, 16 SJS/TEN, and 5 DRESS) and 271 carbamazepine-tolerant controls. We also recruited 470 healthy Thai candidate subjects who had not taken carbamazepine. HLA-B∗15:02 showed a significant association with carbamazepine-induced MPE (P=0.0022, odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 7.27 (2.04-25.97)) and carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN (P=4.46×10-13; OR (95% CI) = 70.91(19.67-255.65)) when compared with carbamazepine-tolerant controls. Carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN also showed an association with HLA-B∗15:21 allele (P=0.013; OR (95% CI) = 9.54 (1.61-56.57)) when compared with carbamazepine-tolerant controls. HLA-B∗58:01 allele was significantly related to carbamazepine-induced MPE (P=0.007; OR (95% CI) = 4.73 (1.53-14.66)) and DRESS (P=0.0315; OR (95% CI) = 7.55 (1.20-47.58)) when compared with carbamazepine-tolerant controls. These alleles may serve as markers to predict carbamazepine-induced cADRs in the Thai population."
"A new species of Hoya (Marsdenieae), three new combinations and two new names in Vincetoxicum (Asclepiadeae) from Thailand  2018, College of Life Science.

"DIMITRA paediatric skull phantoms: Development of age-specific paediatric models for dentomaxillofacial radiology research  2018 The Authors. Published by the British Institute of Radiology.Objectives: This report aims to describe the development of age-specific phantoms for use in paediatric dentomaxillofacial radiology research. These phantoms are denoted DIMITRA paediatric skull phantoms as these have been primarily developed and validated for the DIMITRA European research project (Dentomaxillofacial paediatric imaging: an investigation towards low-dose radiation induced risks). Methods: To create the DIMITRA paediatric phantoms, six human paediatric skulls with estimated ages ranging between 4 and 10 years- old were selected, protected with nonradiopaque tape and immersed in melted Mix-D soft tissue equivalent material, by means of a careful procedure (layer-by-layer). Mandibles were immersed separately and a Mix-D tongue model was also created. For validation purposes, the resulting paediatric phantoms were scanned using a cone-beam CT unit with different exposure parameter settings. Results: Preliminary images deriving from all scans were evaluated by two dentomaxillofacial radiologists, to check for air bubbles, artefacts and inhomogeneities of the Mix-D and a potential effect on the visualization of the jaw bone. Only skulls presenting perfect alignment of Mix-D surrounding the bone surfaces with adequate and realistic soft tissue thickness density were accepted. Conclusions: The DIMITRA anthropomorphic phantoms can yield clinically equivalent images for optimization studies in dentomaxillofacial research. In addition, the layer-by-layer technique proved to be practical and reproducible, as long as recommendations are carefully followed."
"pH effect on characteristics and ammonia sensing of silver nanoparticles synthesized in the presence of tannic acid  2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.Silver nanoparticles were synthesized using silver nitrate as a silver precursor in the presence of tannic acid under UV radiation for 60 minutes. Various pH conditions were employed in the synthesis in order to study its effect on characteristics and ammonia sensing of the synthesized nanoparticles. The images obtained from transmission electron microscope revealed the formation of the spherical particles with average diameters in the range of 10-40 nm depending on pH conditions. It was found that using acidic condition resulted in yellow silver nanoparticles colloids with bigger particles and exhibiting a UV-visible absorbance peak at around 435 nm whereas using other conditions yielded greenish-yellow colloids with smaller particles and having two absorbance peaks at around 370 and 430 nm. After adding 100 ppm of ammonia, TEM images revealed the aggregation and the changes in size and shape of the silver nanoparticles. The color of the silver nanoparticles colloids synthesized using acidic condition changed to orange-yellow color. However, other pH conditions caused the color of the colloids became darker. These color changes were observed by the naked eyes."
"Displacement of diaphragm wall for very deep basement excavation in soft Bangkok clay  2018 GEOMATE International Society.Rosewood Hotel Project consists of 6 basements by using a diaphragm wall as a soil protection system. Elevations of Rosewood Hotel basements are -2.9, -6.5 -9.25, -11.95, -14.65 and -18.9 m. depth from the ground surface. Final excavation depth of this project is -24.2 m. from the ground surface which is area intended for a lift pit. Due to the fact that the final depth of this project is very deep, the effect of water pressure was also considered. Finite Element Method (FEM) was carried out to predict behavior and displacement of the diaphragm wall which is used as a soil protection system. In addition, the Mohr-Coulomb soil modeling was used as failure criteria of the FEM analysis. Measured lateral movement of the diaphragm wall by means of inclinometer at all stages of construction was compared with analytical results from FEM prediction. The predicted diaphragm wall displacement by FEM agrees well with field performance."
"Development of simulation model for estimating gas emissions from equipment in railway construction processes  2018 GEOMATE International Society.The railway construction utilizes several pieces of heavy equipment resulting in exhaust emissions such as pollution and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The release of emissions can affect the environment and human health. Although many previous studies have attempted to approximately estimate the amount of emissions, they did not consider the detailed processes of construction. The simulation model can be applied to improve this limitation and provides the ability to allocate resources and optimize the construction process. In addition, it can help to analyze alternative approaches to reduce emissions. This paper presents the development of simulation model to analyze the amount of exhaust emissions from the equipment usage in railway construction. It compares the amount of exhaust emissions from the situation in the railway construction process, which will demonstrate the effects on the relationship between the amount of exhaust emissions and the construction approach. As a result, this research provides an alternative method to manage exhaust emissions from the railway construction process and resource management."
"Fast and efficient removal of hexavalent chromium from water by iron oxide particles  2018, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University. All rights reserved.Iron oxide particles (IOPs) were synthesized by chemical co-precipitation technique and further used as an adsorbent in removing hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from aqueous solutions during batch adsorption. The IOP adsorbent had specific surface area of 65 m2/g, total pore volume of 0.25 cm3/g and mostly contained a mesoporous structure. The analysis of scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicated that the adsorbent contained a substantial amount of iron oxide of about 66%, which was well distributed throughout the adsorbent. The IOP adsorbent showed a rapid and efficient Cr(VI) removal that followed Langmuir adsorption isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacity of 2.39 mg-Cr(VI)/g-IOP, demonstrating a monolayer formation on the adsorptive sites of IOP. The kinetic adsorption of Cr(VI) on the IOP followed the pseudo-second-order model, suggesting chemisorption. Thus, the IOP adsorbent provides a potentially effective technology in eliminating of Cr(VI) from water since it can remove appreciable amounts of Cr(VI) with a relatively short contact time of 30 min."
"6,8-Dibromo- and 6,8-Diiodo-5,7-dihydroxyflavones as New Potent Antibacterial Agents  2018 The Chemical Society of Japan.Thirteen flavones including chrysin, three natural and nine synthesized compounds, were examined for antibacterial activity. 6,8-Dibromo- (11) and 6,8-diiodo-5,7-dihydroxyflavone (12) exhibited the highest activity against all bacteria with MIC 31.2562.5 μM. For Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus, these compounds were bacteriostatic agents, while for Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, and Salmonella typhi, they were bactericidal agents. The combination of 11 and 12 with known antibiotics displayed synergistic effect. The combination of 11 with streptomycin (16) revealed the most synergistic effect with rate in increasing antibacterial activity of streptomycin in combination was sixteen folds against P. acnes, S. sobrinus, and S. mutans."
"Epigallocatechin gallate-zinc oxide co-crystalline nanoparticles as an anticancer drug that is non-toxic to normal cells  2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Decreased uptake and cellular accumulation of zinc is a common characteristic in cancer of the liver, pancreas and prostate, because these malignant cells are intolerant to the physiological concentrations of zinc. A tea polyphenol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), can enhance the cytotoxicity of zinc ions to cancer, but the application of this is limited by the low stability of EGCG. In this work, we have prepared a material that can simultaneously preserve the EGCG stability and facilitate zinc uptake and accumulation in cancer cells, under conditions that are not harmful to normal cells. Thus, we co-crystallize zinc oxide with EGCG to obtain hybrid EGCG-ZnO crystalline nanoparticles of 16.5 ± 5.3 nm in diameter. The EGCG-ZnO particles effectively kill PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells at concentrations that are not cytotoxic to normal cells, WI-38 human embryonic lung fibroblasts. The EGCG-ZnO particles are two times more cytotoxic against PC-3 cells than the standard ZnO particles. In PC-3 cells, the EGCG-ZnO particles are taken up by endocytosis, followed by lysosomal disruption to release zinc and EGCG into the cytoplasm, finally resulting in nuclear accumulation of zinc."
"Quantifying the Effects of Grain Refiner Addition on the Solidification of Fe-Rich Intermetallics in Al–Si–Cu Alloys Using In Situ Synchrotron X-Ray Tomography  The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society 2018.The presence of Fe-rich intermetallics, particularly β-Al5FeSi, in aluminium alloy cast components can often limit fatigue life. There is an on-going effort to control the formation of these detrimental phases through the additions of trace elements and grain refiners. However, the role of grain refinement on the formation of intermetallics is still unclear and conflicting results exist. To gain better understanding, in situ synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy experiments were performed on a commercial Al–Si–Cu alloy with grain refiner addition. Three-dimensional microstructure evolution and intermetallic precipitation were quantified. The influence of the β-intermetallics on the evolution of permeability during equiaxed dendritic solidification was also investigated numerically. The results illustrate that grain refinement affects α-Al grain structure as well as nucleation temperature of primary and intermetallic phases, but there is no evidence that it alters the precipitation sequence of intermetallics or their morphology. The simulation results reveal that intermetallics block interdendritic liquid flow and hence reduce permeability."
"Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on motor activity of lower limb muscles in chronic stroke  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS] enhances cortical excitability and increases lower limb force in healthy volunteer and stroke patients. Effects of tDCS on motor activity of lower limb muscle and gait performance in chronic stroke patients was not explored. Objective: To study the effects of tDCS on motor activity of lower limb muscles and gait performance in chronic stroke patients. Materials and Methods: Ten chronic stroke patients participated in a single-blind, crossover, and sham-controlled pilot study. Each patient participated in two stimulation conditions applied to the lower limb motor cortex area of affected hemisphere, i.e., anodal stimulation (2 mA, 10 minutes) and sham stimulation (2 mA, 30 seconds). The sequence of stimulation was randomly assigned. Wash-out period between stimulation is at least 48 hours. Root mean square [RMS] amplitude and median frequency [MF] of the vastus medialis oblique [VMO] and tibialis anterior [TA] muscles of the paretic limb and the Timed Up & Go test [TUG] were measured before and immediately after stimulation. Results: The average RMS amplitude of the VMO muscle of the paretic limb increased by 13.6% and 7.7% after anodal tDCS and sham stimulation, consecutively. The average RMS amplitude of the TA muscle decreased by 2.3% and increased by 9.1% after tDCS and sham stimulation. The average MF of the VMO muscle of the paretic limb decreased by 1.9% and 2.9% after anodal tDCS and sham stimulation, consecutively. The average MF of the TA muscle decreased by 2.4% and increased by 2.9% after tDCS and sham stimulation. The TUG was decreased by 1.2% and increased by 1.7% after tDCS and sham stimulation, consecutively. RMS, MF, and TUG were not statistically different between tDCS and sham stimulation (ANCOVA test, p>0.05). Conclusion: Single session of anodal tDCS at ipsilesional hemisphere could not enhance motor activity of lower limb muscles in chronic stroke patients."
"Recovery room incidents from the first 2,000 reports: Perioperative and anesthetic adverse events in Thailand [PAAd thai] study  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: The Royal College of Anesthesiologists hosted the Perioperative and Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand [PAAd Thai] Study to investigate incidences and models of anesthesia related adverse events for suggested preventive strategies. Objective: To investigate critical incidents occurring in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit [PACU]. Materials and Methods: Structured incident reports were requested to be filled in by anesthesia provider and/or site manager of 22 hospitals in Thailand. Critical incidents of interest occurred in the PACU between January 1 and December 31, 2015 and were sent for review by three senior anesthesiologists. Discussion and consensus was used to resolve any discrimination among reviewers. Descriptive statistics were used. Results: Among 333,219 anesthetics, there were 221 incidents (10.5%) of the first 2,000 incident reports that occurred in the PACU. The most common critical incidents were respiratory complications (81%) such as reintubation (50.7%), oxygen desaturation (50.2%), suspected emergence delirium (6.6%), and anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid or allergic reaction (5.7%). Four cardiac arrests occurred with two deaths within 24 hours. Conclusion: Twenty percent of the incidents were considered preventable. Regarding the model of anesthesia related adverse events, the contributing factors were inappropriate decision making, inadequate preanesthetic evaluation, and inexperience. The factors minimizing incidents were vigilance and having experience. Suggested corrective strategies are quality assurance activities, training, improvement of supervision, and communication. A handoff procedure using checklists was suggested for further improvement."
"Long-term seizure outcome after temporal lobectomy for hippocampal sclerosis  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Objective: To study long-term seizure outcomes in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy [TLE] with hippocampal sclerosis [HS]. Materials and Methods: One hundred twelve patients with drug resistant TLE underwent temporal lobectomy and had pathologically proven HS between 2004 and 2008. All patients had a minimum follow-up of five years. Seizure outcome was categorized into being seizure-free and not seizure-free. Results: Sixty one patients (54.5%) were seizure free for the entire period after surgery. One hundred patients (89.3%) were seizure free for at least two years at the last follow-up. Forty three patients (38.4%) were able to stop antiepileptic medications. The mean follow-up was 8.1±1.9 years (range 5 to 11 years). A preoperative secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure was predictor for poor seizure outcome. Conclusion: A long-term outcome (more than five years) in terms of a percentage of seizure free in TLE with HS [TLE-HS] patients remains favorable. Long-term seizure outcome is helpful for preoperative and postoperative counseling to the patients. Surgical treatment should be considered in patients with drug-resistant TLE-HS."
"Esophageal intubation in the first 2,000 incidents reports of perioperative and anesthetic adverse events in Thailand [PAAd Thai] study  2018, Medical Association of Thailand. All rights reserved.Background: Esophageal intubation [EI] is one of the most common events in perioperative airway management especially in anesthesia training situations. Objective: To examine incidents and contributing factors including corrective strategies of EI in the Perioperative and Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand [PAAd Thai] Study, hosted by the Royal College of Anesthesiologists of Thailand. Materials and Methods: A multi-center prospective observational study was conducted between January and December 2015. All EI incidents from the first 2,000 incident reports from 22 participating hospitals across Thailand were reported and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: One hundred sixty-nine EI incidents (8.45%) were reported from the first 2,000 incident reports in the PAAd Thai database. The incidence of delayed detection of EI was rare (0.28:10,000). Practice with trainees is a common situation (55.6%), however, most cases were early detection by clinical examination and/or capnometer without physiologic sequelae. Pediatric patients, cesarean section, and difficult intubation may lead to oxygen desaturation, with few cases of oxygen desaturation and bradycardia. Conclusion: While the EI incidence rates in Thailand remained constant, the incidence of delayed detection was dramatically reduced because of increased availability of end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring. Vigilance, additional training, and more equipment availability are recommended."

"Innovativeness in thai family SMEs: An exploratory case study  2018 Small Business Institute.Over the past decade, academic research has revealed innovativeness to be one of the core components effecting SME performance. This research aims to study the linkage between innovativeness and “familiness” in family SMEs. The paper employs a qualitative approach and exploratory case studies, in collecting data on three categories of firms manufacturing, trading and servicing companies in order to identify how “familiness” effects the innovativeness of their family SMEs. To identify how “familiness” either accelerates or decelerates innovativeness in family SMEs, we adopted the F-PEC scale as a tool to study the connection between family and business values and also the impact of family commitments to the company. We found that power, experience and culture accelerate innovativeness in family SMEs. The paper illustrates the important role of family in firm innovativeness and how this can bring competitive advantage and success to family SMEs."
"Seroprevalence of anaplasmosis in dairy cattle from Peninsular Malaysia  2018 Jesse et al.Bovine anaplasmosis also known as Red water or Gall sickness is an important disease of cattle primarily caused by Anaplasma marginale and it infects erythrocytes, which results to erythrophagocytosis and subsequently anaemia. This study was carried out to determine the seroprevalence of bovine anaplasmosis among dairy cattle in some randomly selected ruminant farms in Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 45 Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture from cattle from four (4) farms using convenient sampling technique. Twelve(12) cows were sampled from each of farms A and B, while 13 cows were sampled from farm C and 8 from Farm D. Heparinized whole blood was used to prepare Giemsa-stained thin blood smears for microscopic detection of anaplasmosis. Serum was extracted from coagulated blood for serological testing using Anaplasma antibody Test Kit (VMRD, Inc. United State of America). The result showed an overall seroprevalence rate of 51.11% (23/45). Farm level seropositivity showed 83.3% (10/12), 41.7% (5/12), 23.1% (3/13) and 62.5% (5/8) for Farms A, B, C, and D, respectively. Age specific seroprevalence showed a 53.13% (17/32) in cows that are more than 3 years old and 46.15% (6/13) in cows aged between 1-3 years. Additionally, a significant (p<0.05) association between microscopic detection and serological detection method was observed. . In conclusion, a high seroprevalence rate was observed in the selected ruminant farms."
"Real-Time Polyps Segmentation for Colonoscopy Video Frames Using Compressed Fully Convolutional Network  2018, Springer International Publishing AG.Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. As of now, colonoscopy is the most effective screening tool for diagnosing colorectal cancer by searching for polyps which can develop into colon cancer. The drawback of manual colonoscopy process is its high polyp miss rate. Therefore, polyp detection is a crucial issue in the development of colonoscopy application. Despite having high evaluation scores, the recently published methods based on fully convolutional network (FCN) require a very long inferring (testing) time that cannot be applied in a real clinical process due to a large number of parameters in the network. In this paper, we proposed a compressed fully convolutional network by modifying the FCN-8s network, so our network is able to detect and segment polyp from video images within a real-time constraint in a practical screening routine. Furthermore, our customized loss function allows our network to be more robust when compared to the traditional cross-entropy loss function. The experiment was conducted on CVC-EndoSceneStill database which consists of 912 video frames from 36 patients. Our proposed framework has obtained state-of-the-art results while running more than 7 times faster and requiring fewer weight parameters by more than 9 times. The experimental results convey that our system has the potential to support clinicians during the analysis of colonoscopy video by automatically indicating the suspicious polyps locations."
"DNA methylation status of the interspersed repetitive sequences for LINE-1, Alu, HERV-E, and HERV-K in trabeculectomy specimens from glaucoma eyes  2018 Sunee Chansangpetch et al.Background/Aims. Epigenetic mechanisms via DNA methylation may be related to glaucoma pathogenesis. This study aimed to determine the global DNA methylation level of the trabeculectomy specimens among patients with different types of glaucoma and normal subjects. Methods. Trabeculectomy sections from 16 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), 12 primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), 16 secondary glaucoma patients, and 10 normal controls were assessed for DNA methylation using combined-bisulfite restriction analysis. The percentage of global methylation level of the interspersed repetitive sequences for LINE-1, Alu, HERV-E, and HERV-K were compared between the 4 groups. Results. There were no significant differences in the methylation for LINE-1 and HERV-E between patients and normal controls. For the Alu marker, the methylation was significantly lower in all types of glaucoma patients compared to controls (POAG 52.19% versus control 52.83%, p=0.021; PACG 51.50% versus control, p=0.005; secondary glaucoma 51.95% versus control, p=0.014), whereas the methylation level of HERV-K was statistically higher in POAG patients compared to controls (POAG 49.22% versus control 48.09%, p=0.017). Conclusions. The trabeculectomy sections had relative DNA hypomethylation of Alu in all glaucoma subtypes and relative DNA hypermethylation of HERV-K in POAG patients. These methylation changes may lead to the fibrotic phenotype in the trabecular meshwork."
"Effect of vital tooth bleaching on surface roughness and streptococcal biofilm formation on direct tooth-colored restorative materials  Operative Dentistry, 2018.Objective: To compare the effect of simulated bleaching with a 10% carbamide peroxide (CP) or a 40% hydrogen peroxide (HP) system on surface roughness of resin composite and resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGI) and streptococcal biofilm formation on these surfaces. Methods and Materials: Specimens of nanofilled resin composite and RMGI (n=108 each) were randomly divided into three groups (n=36 each): no treatment control, 10% CP, and 40% HP. The surface roughness values (Ra) were measured before and after treatments. The specimens in each group were randomly divided into three subgroups (n=12) and incubated with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and trypticase soy broth control for 24 hours. Biofilm formation was quantified by crystal violet staining, and the structure was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. The differences between the mean changes in Ra between the 10% CP and 40% HP groups of each material were evaluated with an independent t-test. The quantity of biofilm forma-tion on each material was analyzed with oneway analysis of variance with the post hoc Tukey test (a=0.05). Results: Surface roughness significantly increased after bleaching in all groups. There was no significant difference between the 10% CP and 40% HP groups of each material. For S. mutans biofilm formation, bleaching with 10% CP and 40% HP increased biofilm on both materials compared to controls. However, S. sanguinis biofilm formation was significantly higher on bleached resin composite but not on RMGI specimens. Conclusions: Simulated bleaching with 10% CP or 40% HP increased both surface roughness and biofilm formation on resin composite and RMGI, except for S. sanguinis biofilm on RMGI."
"Morphological and mitochondrial DNA data reshuffle the taxonomy of the genera Atopochetus Attems, Litostrophus Chamberlin and Tonkinbolus Verhoeff (Diplopoda: Spirobolida: Pachybolidae), with descriptions of nine new species  CSIRO 2018.Species-level taxonomy and phylogeny of two genera of South-East (SE) Asian pachybolid millipedes are analysed with a combination of morphological characters and DNA sequences (two mitochondrial gene fragments: COI and 16S rRNA). Strong support is found for the genera Litostrophus Chamberlin, 1921 and Atopochetus Attems, 1953 and for a clade consisting of Litostrophus + Atopochetus. Four species of Litostrophus are recognised and (re)described: L. segregatus Chamberlin, 1921 (type species of the genus), L. scaber (Verhoeff, 1938), comb. nov., L. chamaeleon, sp. nov. and L. saraburensis, sp. nov. The genus Tonkinbolus Verhoeff, 1938 (type species T. scaber Verhoeff, 1938) is synonymised under Litostrophus. Atopochetus (type species A. rubropunctatus Attems, 1953), hitherto considered a dubious synonym of Aulacobolus Pocock, 1903, is re-instated for several species until now placed in Tonkinbolus and seven new species. All in all, 10 species of Atopochetus are (re)described: A. dollfusii (Pocock, 1893) (≤ Aulacobolus rubropunctatus Attems, 1938, syn. nov.), A. moulmeinensis (Pocock, 1893), A. sumatranus (Carl, 1906) (≤ Trachelomegalus laciniatus Attems, 1937, syn. nov.), A. anaticeps, sp. nov., A. helix, sp. nov., A. setiferus, sp. nov., A. spinimargo, sp. nov., A. truncatus, sp. nov., A. uncinatus, sp. nov. and A. weseneri, sp. nov. Three species recently included in Tonkinbolus are left incertae sedis because they are based exclusively on female type specimens: Spirobolus capucinus Porat, 1896, S. caudulanus Karsch, 1881 and S. macrurus Pocock, 1893. The results of the DNA analysis (COI and 16S rRNA) are congruent with morphological (gonopodal) characters in terms of delimitation of species of Litostrophus and Atopochetus. This is the first DNA study of SE Asian Pachybolidae and as such it provides a basis for further evolutionary and biogeographic studies of SE Asian millipedes."
"Characterization and screening of lipolytic bacteria from Thai fermented fish Nine bacterial strains were isolated from Thai fermented fish by the standard dilution technique using JCM no. 377 medium. The rod shaped isolate FN2-3 was identified as Virgibacillus dokdonensis while isolates FN2-3 and FN6-6 as V. halodenitrificans, FN1-13 as Corynebacterium variabile, FN1-10 as Oceanobacillus iheyensis and FN3-7 was Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum. The coccal isolates, FN6-1 and FN6-7 were Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. bovis and FN6-8 was S. saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, based on their phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses at a 99.63-100% sequence similarity. Their lipase activity in complex medium (CM), CM medium with 1% (v/v) Tween 20 or CM medium with 1% (v/v) Tween 80 ranged from 1.12 ± 0.03-3.77 ± 0.04 unit/mL, with the highest lipase activity found with V. dokdonensis FN1-8 cultivated with CM with 1% (v/v) Tween 80."
"Two New Species of Ansonia from Thailand (Anura: Bufonidae)  2018 Zoological Society of Japan.The taxonomic status of two populations of stream toads of the genus Ansonia from Thailand, previously suspected to be specifically distinct on the basis of molecular data, are assessed using morphological and additional genetic data. In mtDNA phylogeny, each of the two Thai lineages, one from Pilok Subdistrict, Kanchanaburi, and another from Phuket Island, are separated from other congenerics from the Thai-Malay Peninsula by large genetic distances, comparable with those observed between other species in the genus. Although each of the two lineages is superficially similar to other species morphologically, they are distinguishable in several morphological traits and are considered to represent valid, independently evolving species. We therefore describe them as A. pilokensis sp. nov. and A. phuketensis sp. nov."
"A simple paper-based colorimetric device for rapid and sensitive urinary oxalate determinations  The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry, 2018. In this work, a simple and inexpensive paper-based colorimetric device (cPAD) was developed for oxalate measurements. The colorimetric assay is based on the formation of formazan via the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) by oxalate decarboxylase and formate dehydrogenase on the paper device. After the sample was spotted on the device, MTT changed color from yellow to purple, and the purple color intensity correlated with the oxalate concentration. The quantitative detection of oxalate ranged from 10 - 1000 μM, with a linear equation, y = 0.0086x + 34.978, and a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) = 0.9994. The detection limit was 10 μM by the naked eye. The recoveries of oxalate spiked in artificial urine samples evaluated by our cPADs were in the range of 81 - 92%. This simple cPAD for rapid and sensitive oxalate determination should be useful for diagnostic urinary oxalate measurements for point-of-care monitoring."
"The stability of augmented bone between two different membranes used for guided bone regeneration simultaneous with dental implant placement in the Esthetic Zone  2018 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.Purpose: This randomized controlled clinical trial compared the stability of augmented bone between a synthetic resorbable membrane and a collagen resorbable membrane with guided bone regeneration (GBR) simultaneous with dental implant placement in the esthetic zone in terms of facial bone thickness. Materials and Methods: A total of 60 dental implants from patients requiring implant placement with simultaneous GBR in the esthetic zone were equally allocated to the test group or control group by block randomization. Biphasic calcium phosphate ceramic bone was used in combination with either a polylactic acid (PLA) membrane (test group, 30 implants) or a resorbable collagen membrane (control group, 30 implants). Cone beam computed tomographic (CBCT) images were used to assess the facial bone thickness postimplantation and then 6 months later at four levels: implant platform and 2 mm, 4 mm, and 6 mm apical to the implant shoulder. Results: All implants were osseointegrated, and no implant loss was found during this study. Facial bone was detected in all cases; however, the thickness of the facial bone was reduced at the 6-month follow-up in both groups. The percentage of facial bone thickness reduction was 34.30%, 27.94%, 24.25%, and 19.81% in the test group and 34.80%, 24.06%, 19.52%, and 20.45% in the control group at the level of the implant platform and at 2 mm, 4 mm, and 6 mm apical to the implant shoulder, respectively. Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P > .05). Conclusion: A synthetic resorbable membrane revealed an amount of stable augmented bone similar to that of a collagen resorbable membrane."
"Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for determination of creatinine in urine samples  The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry, 2018.Simple, low-cost and portable microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) for determination of creatinine in urine samples were developed. The methodology was based on Jaffé reaction between the creatinine and picric acid in alkaline conditions, generating a colorimetric creatinine-alkaline picrate complex. The product exhibits an orange color that is clearly visible on the μPADs. The color intensity of the complex, which is indicative of the concentration of creatinine, is then quantitatively determined using ImageJ software. Various experimental parameters were optimized to achieve the best performance of the μPADs. Under the optimum conditions, a wide linear range was obtained in the range of 0.2 - 1 mM with a limit of detection and limit of quantitation of 0.08 and 0.26 mM, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was in good agreement with the standard Jaffé method. Finally, the developed devices were successfully applied for the determination of creatinine in urine samples."
"Wax-assisted one-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on lateral flow test devices  The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry, 2018. Lateral flow tests (LFTs) are widely used analytical tools characterized by portability, operator simplicity and short analysis times. A remaining challenge is their limited analytical sensitivity, which in classical immunoassay formats is overcome by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) formats. The implementation of ELISA to an LFT format however, is hampered by the complexity of the procedure requiring the enzyme substrate addition after sample addition. In this work, a simple method for automation of this procedure without user interference is presented. Originally used sample pads of LFTs have been replaced by hydrophobic wax-modified filter paper-based sample pads to realize a delayed flow a pre-deposited colorimetric ELISA substrate without other alterations to the classical lateral-flow immunoassay format. The performance of the system has been characterized by visualizing flow behavior and final proof-of-concept is provided by a model mouse IgG assay, achieving a limit of detection of 15.8 ng mL -1 from just a single application of the sample solution."
"Search for supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV using identified top quarks SEARCH for SUPERSYMMETRY in PROTON-PROTON ⋯ A. M. SIRUNYAN et al.  2018 CERN. for the CMS Collaboration.A search for supersymmetry is presented based on proton-proton collision events containing identified hadronically decaying top quarks, no leptons, and an imbalance pTmiss in transverse momentum. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. Search regions are defined in terms of the multiplicity of bottom quark jet and top quark candidates, the pTmiss, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, and the mT2 mass variable. No statistically significant excess of events is observed relative to the expectation from the standard model. Lower limits on the masses of supersymmetric particles are determined at 95% confidence level in the context of simplified models with top quark production. For a model with direct top squark pair production followed by the decay of each top squark to a top quark and a neutralino, top squark masses up to 1020 GeV and neutralino masses up to 430 GeV are excluded. For a model with pair production of gluinos followed by the decay of each gluino to a top quark-antiquark pair and a neutralino, gluino masses up to 2040 GeV and neutralino masses up to 1150 GeV are excluded. These limits extend previous results."
"Review of major shale-dominated detachment and thrust characteristics in the diagenetic zone: Part II, rock mechanics and microscopic scale  2017 Elsevier B.V.Characterising large shale thrust zone behaviour down to the diagenetic-metamorphic boundary is both simple and complex. The task in critical taper, analogue and numerical models has been successfully approximated using simple material parameters. Yet the weakness of shales thrusts on a case-by-case basis show great variability in key factors across a wide range of scales. Understanding of these variables and their relationships to different tectonic settings is patchy due to the different objectives of workers studying the various systems (e.g. seismic hazards, hydrocarbon exploration, structural geology research), and the types of available geological and geophysical data. Early research recognized that megathrusts feature creeping and locked patches, which may be described using the rate and state formalism. In addition to temperature, differential stress and strain rate, key controlling factors on thrust weakness are mineralogy, amount of weak phase present, structure localization mechanisms, grain size and shapes, porosity, permeability and pore fluid pressure. The smectite-illite transition has been a focus of seismic hazard research due to its coincidence with the top of the seismogenic zone. While there may be a relationship, other factors such as pore-fluid pressure variations or structure localization are also important. The critical taper model is a simple means of determining whether basic rock mechanics data (e.g. frictional strength, pore fluid pressure) is appropriate for natural wedges. For example, aseismic basal detachments of gravity driven systems (smaller critical taper wedges) appear to retain higher pore fluid pressures along the basal detachment than seismogenic basal detachments (higher critical taper wedges). In many continental and deltaic fold and thrust belts high organic carbon content is a very important factor in shale weakness due to: 1) the overall more ductile and well-cleaved nature of the shale when organic content is high, 2) the presence of high overpressures due to maturation of organic material, and 3) metamorphism of carbon to low friction graphite. This multifaceted influence of organic carbon content is just one example of the diversity of potential influences on shale thrust zone weakness, which enable shales to be weak despite considerable lateral deposition-related and vertical burial-related changes in composition. Some key variations between different types of fold and thrust belt (gravity driven; accretionary prism; Andean/Himalayan type) lie in systematic variations in clay mineralogy, magnitudes and origins of overpressures, seismic versus aseismic detachments, and different structural localization mechanisms. Further research is required to explore the viability of such distinctions and their impact on structural styles."
"Soft poly(2-chloroaniline)/pectin hydrogel and its electromechanical properties  The Author(s) 2017.Pectin hydrogels were successfully fabricated with various physical crosslinkers and concentrations for soft actuator applications. A small amount of synthesized P2ClAn was added as a dispersed phase into the pectin matrix. The electromechanical properties of the pectin hydrogels and blends were investigated under the effects of electric field strength, ionic crosslinker type and concentration, and P2ClAn concentration. The electromechanical properties of the pectin hydrogel as crosslinked by Fe2+ were superior to other pectin hydrogels. The pristine pectin hydrogel and the P2ClAn/Pectin hydrogel blended with 0.10%v/v P2ClAn provided the high storage modulus sensitivity values of 8.61 and 14.01, respectively, under the electric field strength of 800 V/mm. The P2ClAn/Pectin hydrogel blend responded to the electric field with higher dielectrophoretic forces, but lower deflections relative to the pristine pectin hydrogel due to the additional P2ClAn polarization and the latter lower rigidity."
"Search for low mass vector resonances decaying into quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).A search for narrow vector resonances decaying into quark-antiquark pairs is presented. The analysis is based on data collected in proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. The hypothetical resonance is produced with sufficiently high transverse momentum that its decay products are merged into a single jet with two-prong substructure. A signal would be identified as a peak over a smoothly falling background in the distribution of the invariant mass of the jet, using novel jet substructure techniques. No evidence for such a resonance is observed within the mass range of 50-300 GeV. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section, and presented in a mass-coupling parameter space. The limits further constrain simplified models of dark matter production involving a mediator interacting between quarks and dark matter particles through a vector or axial-vector current. In the framework of these models, the results are the most sensitive to date, extending for the first time the search region to masses below 100 GeV.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Transcatheter examination of the peritoneal dialysis catheter with the spyglass direct visualization system: A new aid in diagnosis and salvation of ultrafiltration failure from partial catheter obstruction  2018, Multimed Inc. All rights reserved.Mechanical complications in peritoneal dialysis (PD), including intraluminal clogging of the PD catheter by fibrin, omentum, or blood clot, are major causes of outflow problems and, in rare cases, lead to technical failure. To visualize an intraluminal image of patients undergoing PD with ineffective ultrafiltration (UF), a SpyGlass fiber optic probe was inserted into the catheter, together with SpyBite biopsy forceps, should the removal of clogging materials be needed. Applying these transcatheter devices in 2 PD patients with unexplained UF failure led to the demonstration of omental plugging at the catheter tip in the first patient and demonstration of intraluminal blood clots in the second patient from whom clots were removal successfully. Both patients achieved better UF volume thereafter without procedure-related complications."
"Awareness of middle sacral artery pathway: A cadaveric study of the presacral area  The Author(s) 2018.Purpose: To assess the anatomic path of the middle sacral artery (MSA) at the presacral area and its relationship to the spinal midline during an axial lumbar interbody fusion (AxiaLif) approach. Methods: Fifty human cadavers (25 males, 25 females) were used in this study. A transabdominal approach was used to expose the anterior aspect of the L5/S1 intervertebral disc and the presacral space. We measured the size and distance from the spinal midline at the following positions: (a) middle of the L5/S1 disc level, (b) 1 cm below the sacral promontory (SP), and (c) 2 cm below the SP. Each parameter was measured three times by two observers, and the mean value analyzed. Results: The MSA was present and originated from the left common iliac artery in all cadavers with a mean width of 2.14 mm. The position of the MSA in relation to the midline was most commonly on the left side (LS, 56%) followed by the right side (RS, 34%) and midline (ML, 10%). In the LS group, the distance from the midline is relatively constant in the three measured positions with a mean value of (a) 1.78 mm (range, 0–8.17 mm), (b) 2.08 mm (range, 0–7.10 mm), and (c) 2.06 mm (range, 0–9.76 mm). In the RS group, the distance from the midline increased from cephalad to caudad, with a mean value of (a) 1.44 mm (range, 0–9.64 mm), (b) 2.19 mm (range, 0–9.95 mm), and (c) 2.92 mm (range, 0–10.03 mm). Conclusions: Our study found the presacral anatomic path of the MSA was most commonly at the left of midline. In addition, the right-sided MSA variant had increasing distance from the midline along its anatomic path from cephalad to caudad. Our findings suggest an AxiaLif approach at the left of midline may place the MSA at greatest risk."
"Production of ethylene through ethanol dehydration on sba-15 catalysts synthesized by sol-gel and one-step hydrothermal methods  2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.The present work deals with the catalytic performance of SBA-15 supported catalysts in the gas phase catalytic dehydration of ethanol in the temperature range of 200 to 400℃. The SBA-15 support was incorporated on a zirconium (Zr) and bimetal of zirconium and lanthanum (Zr-La) prepared by sol-gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) methods. The catalysts were characterized by means of N2 physisorption, SEM/ EDX, and NH3-TPD. The experimental results demonstrated that the Zr-La/SBA-15-HT exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Ethanol conversion and ethylene selectivity were found to increase with increased reaction temperature. The best catalytic results were achieved for Zr-La/SBA-15-HT indicating values of ethanol conversion and ethylene yield of ca. 84% and 80%, respectively at 400℃. The most important parameter influencing their catalytic properties appears to be the interaction between metal and support depending on different methods. The metal dispersion inside the siliceous matrix of SBA-15 has a direct influence on their surface acidity. Meanwhile, the performance of these SBA-15 supported catalysts in ethanol dehydration is also related with the alteration of surface acidity caused by the introduction of Zr and Zr-La."
"Laundry detergency of solid non-particulate soil using microemulsion-based formulation  2018 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.Laundry detergency of solid non-particulate soil on polyester and cotton was investigated using a microemulsion-based formulation, consisting of an anionic extended surfactant (C12,13-4PO-SO4Na) and sodium mono-and di-methyl naphthalene sulfonate (SMDNS) as the hydrophilic linker, to provide a Winsor Type III microemulsion with an ultralow interfacial tension (IFT). In this work, methyl palmitate (palmitic acid methyl ester) having a melting point around 30℃, was used as a model solid non-particulate (waxy) soil. A total surfactant concentration of 0.35 wt% of the selected formulation (4:0.65 weight ratio of C12,13-4PO-SO4Na:SMDNS) with 5.3 wt% NaCl was able to form a middle phase microemulsion at a high temperature (40℃),which provided the highest oil removal level with the lowest oil redeposition and the lowest IFT, and was much higher than that with a commercial detergent or de-ionized water. Most of the detached oil, whether in liquid or solid state, was in an unsolubilized form. Hence, the dispersion stability of the detached oil droplets or solidified oil particles that resulted from the surfactant adsorption played an important role in the oil redeposition. For an oily detergency, the lower the system IFT, the higher the oil removal whereas for a waxy (non-particulate) soil detergency, the lower the contact angle, the higher the solidified oil removal. For a liquefied oil, the detergency mechanism was roll up and emulsification with dispersion stability, while that for the waxy soil (solid oil) was the detachment by wettability with dispersion stability."
"Effects of grass jelly on glycemic control: Hydrocolloids may inhibit gut carbohydrase Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate (1) the hydrocolloid properties of grass jelly on reducing glycaemic response, (2) the impact of phenolic compounds in Mesona chinensis L. on glycaemic response. Methods and Study Design: A total of 15 healthy Chinese men were recruited to this study. On each visit, subjects consumed one of the following three treatments, i.e. glucose solution (T1), grass jelly (Mesona chinensis L.) solution with glucose (T2) or grass jelly gel with glucose (T3). Capillary blood glucose and venous plasma insulin were analysed over a period of 180 min. Results: The incremental area under the curve for capillary glucose and venous plasma insulin for glucose group, grass jelly solution group and grass jelly gel was found to be statistically not significant (p > 0.05). In a previous study the co-ingestion of grass jelly with complex carbohydrate was found to reduce glycaemic response. The key difference between the two studies was the use of monosaccharide glucose in the present study, compared to complex carbohydrates in the other. The present study suggests that the glycaemic lowering effect of grass jelly may be dependent on the inhibition of carbohydrase enzymes. Conclusions: The co-ingestion of Mesona chinensis L. appears to reduce glycaemic response of only complex carbohydrates through the inhibition of carbohydrase. This conclusion was arrived at by the lack of any effect of Mesona chinensis L. on the monosaccharide glucose."

"Infrastructure in the Making: The Chao Phraya Dam and the Dance of Agency Copyright  Institute for East Asian Studies, Sogang University 2018.The article explores the process behind the construction of the Chao Phraya Dam, the first World Bank-funded water infrastructure project in Thailand, developed during the 1950s. Employing Andrew Pickering's 'dance of agency' concept in examining the process of turning financial and technical assistance into a workable project, I argue that development infrastructure, like the Chao Phraya Dam, provides a space to explore the dialectic operations - accommodation and resistance - of agency and the unstable associations among diverse actors, expertise, institutions, and materials, as well as practices. Recounting the history of the dam in the making, I explore a series of entanglements through different dances of agency, namely initiation, assessment, mobilisation, negotiation, adjustment, confrontation, and settlement. Such a multiplicity of dances inside and in the making of infrastructure reflects the techno-political entanglement encompassing the manifold negotiation and adjustment of conflicting goals, interests, recognition, and cooperation among different agencies. The dam, often portrayed as an engineering achievement of the state, is in fact the result of unanticipated relations and the responses to the temporal emerging forms of practices."

"The integration of human thermal comfort in an outdoor campus landscape in a tropical climate  2018, Int. J. of GEOMATE.The purpose of this research is to study and compare outdoor spaces with different cooling devices in the tropical climate of the city campus in the CBD of Bangkok, Thailand. The study aimed to find the most comfortable outdoor space on a green campus, referring to the UI Green Metric World University Ranking indicators, with a case study of Chulalongkorn University, which is a wet, tropical area in the city center. The ratio of the area on campus that is covered with planted vegetation (lawns, gardens) is provided as a percentage of the total site area and is the subject of comparison. In particular, the microclimate seems to be an important criterion of the physical design features of an outdoor space: a) with cooling devices, such as shading and fountains, and b) without cooling devices, such as pavement and open lawn. The cooling effect of these devices, which are evaluated by the thermal comfort measurement results, responded according to the tropical environment of the campus. This study explains the micro/macroclimatic effects of the landscape features. The survey measured the meteorological conditions of the outdoor spaces. The study determined that the shortwave solar radiation and longwave radiation from different materials should play an important role in a new paradigm for green design and planning."
"Quality evaluation of Kaempferia parviflora rhizome with reference to 5,7-dimethoxyflavone  2018 Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research.Kaempferia parviflora Wall. ex Baker is a medicinal plant found in the upper Northeastern regions of Thailand, which belongs to Zingiberaceae family. The present study aims to investigate the standardization parameters, to analyze chemical constituents of volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and to determine the content of 5,7-dimethoxyflavone in K. parviflora rhizomes by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-densitometry compared to TLC image analysis. K. parviflora rhizomes from 15 different sources throughout Thailand were investigated for morphological and pharmacognostic parameters. 5,7-Dimethoxyflavone contents were determined by TLC-densitometry with winCATS software and TLC image analysis with ImageJ software. The mobile phase for TLC development consisted of toluene: chloroform: Acetone: formic acid (5: 4: 1: 0.2). For the Results, the pharmacognostic parameters of K. parviflora rhizome were demonstrated. The loss on drying, total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water content, volatile oil content, ethanol, and water-soluble extractive values were found to be 8.979 ± 0.041, 5.127 ± 0.060, 2.174 ± 0.092, 9.291 ± 0.458, 0.028 ± 0.003, 5.138 ± 0.092, and 8.254 ± 0.191 g/100 g of dry weight, respectively. K. parviflora volatile oil showed the major components of α-copaene, dauca-5, 8-diene, camphene, β-pinene, borneol, and linalool. The 5,7-dimethoxyflavone content of K. parviflora rhizomes determined by TLC-densitometry and TLC image analysis were found to be 2.15 ± 0.64 and 1.96 ± 0.51 g/100 g of dry rhizomes, respectively. The 5,7-dimethoxyflavone contents of both methods were not significantly different (P > 0.05) using paired t-test."
"Grammatophyllum speciosum extract potentiates stemness in keratinocyte cells  2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.This study aimed to explore the effect of ethanolic extract from Grammatophyllum speciosum on stem cell markers and regulatory protein in human keratinocyte cells. After treatment with G. speciosum extract, the stem cell molecular markers CD133 and ALDH1A1, and stemness regulatory protein β-catenin were determined by western blot analysis. The present study demonstrated that the extract at the concentrations of 5-20 μg/ml promoted stem cell clonogenicity as evaluated by spheroid formation as well as anchorage-independent growth assays. Furthermore, treatment of the keratinocytes with the extract significantly up-regulated the stem cell markers. Besides, the induction of stemness was found to protect the cells against oxidative damage. As stem cells have high activity of cellular anti-oxidant mechanisms, such augmentation of stemness may protect these keratinocytes against ROS-induced cell death. This mechanistic study may benefit the development of novel active compounds for anti-aging or treatment of skin disorders."
"Pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons in proton-lead collisions at √sNN=5.02 and 8.16 TeV  2018, The Author(s).The pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons in proton-lead collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies sNN=5.02 and 8.16 TeV are presented. The measurements are based on data samples collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The number of primary charged hadrons produced in non-single-diffractive proton-lead collisions is determined in the pseudorapidity range |ηlab| < 2.4. The charged-hadron multiplicity distributions are compared to the predictions from theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo event generators. In the center-of-mass pseudorapidity range |ηcm| < 0.5, the average charged-hadron multiplicity densities 〈dNch/dηcm〉|ηcm| < 0.5 are 17.31 ± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.59 (syst) and 20.10 ± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.85(syst) at sNN=5.02 and 8.16 TeV, respectively. The particle densities per participant nucleon are compared to similar measurements in proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Transient expression of the homogentisate phytyltransferase gene from Clitoria ternatea causes metabolic enhancement of α-tocopherol biosynthesis and chlorophyll degradation in tomato leaves  2017, Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology.Homogentisate prenyltransferase (HPT) is an important enzyme involved in the α-tocopherol (vitamin E) biosynthetic pathway of all plant taxa. Tocopherol biosynthesis and chlorophyll degradation are related, but more information is needed to explain their relationship. In this study, a candidate gene for HPT from Clitoria ternatea (CtHPT) was isolated and identified via a phylogeny-based approach, and its hypothetical protein sequence was analyzed. Transient expression of CtHPT with Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration into tomato leaves was then performed and observed for the metabolic relationship between the α-tocopherol biosynthesis and chlorophyll degradation by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. In silico analysis showed that CtHPT contained a chloroplast signal peptide and nine-transmembrane α-helixes. The results showed that, the content of α-tocopherol increased in transient expression of CtHPT, with the increased pool sizes of its biosynthetic intermediates: 2-methyl-6-phythylbenzoquinol and 2,3-dimethyl-5-phythylbenzoquinol, and the increased levels of phytol and various fatty acids. Moreover, the CtHPT transient expression was observed to cause chlorophyll deficiency in the tomato leaves with simultaneous increase of phytol and fatty acids, presumably the degradative products of chlorophyll and chloroplast membranes, respectively. It was concluded that the overexpression of CtHPT may enhance the metabolic flow of the α-tocopherol biosynthetic pathway, causing the degradation of chlorophylls, thereby increasing the supply of the precursor phytol for the α-tocopherol biosynthetic pathway."
"Search for resonant and nonresonant Higgs boson pair production in the b b ¯final state in proton-proton collisions at √s=13 TeV  2018, The Author(s).Searches for resonant and nonresonant pair-produced Higgs bosons (HH) decaying respectively into , through either W or Z bosons, and b b ¯ are presented. The analyses are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Data and predictions from the standard model are in agreement within uncertainties. For the standard model HH hypothesis, the data exclude at 95% confidence level a product of the production cross section and branching fraction larger than 72 fb, corresponding to 79 times the standard model prediction. Constraints are placed on different scenarios considering anomalous couplings, which could affect the rate and kinematics of HH production. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section of narrow-width spin-0 and spin-2 particles decaying to Higgs boson pairs, the latter produced with minimal gravity-like coupling.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]."
"Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells heterologously expressing bacterial tyrosine ammonia lyase can use exogenous tyrosine for p-coumaric acid production  2017, Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology.Phototrophic cyanobacteria may be considered as an alternative host for producing numerous bioactive compounds. We demonstrate that the Synechocystis PCC 6803 expressing tyrosine ammonia-lyase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides under Ptrc1O promoter produce p-coumaric acid at a rate three times higher than that under Ptrc1Ocore promoter, accounting for 18.4 ± 1.5 μg of p-coumaric acid per 108 cells (0.36 mg L−1). Additionally, our study is the first report to show the biotransformation of tyrosine to p-coumaric acid reaching a maximum 2.4-fold increase when 0.5 mM tyrosine was supplemented to the growth medium. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed the occurrence of diverse patterns of metabolites under different concentrations of supplemented tyrosine, suggesting that it is used in additional metabolic pathways."
"A Trichosporonales genome tree based on 27 haploid and three evolutionarily conserved ‘natural’ hybrid genomes Copyright  2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.To construct a backbone tree consisting of basidiomycetous yeasts, draft genome sequences from 25 species of Trichosporonales (Tremellomycetes, Basidiomycota) were generated. In addition to the hybrid genomes of Trichosporon coremiiforme and Trichosporon ovoides that we described previously, we identified an interspecies hybrid genome in Cutaneotrichosporon mucoides (formerly Trichosporon mucoides). This hybrid genome had a gene retention rate of ~55%, and its closest haploid relative was Cutaneotrichosporon dermatis. After constructing the C. mucoides subgenomes, we generated a phylogenetic tree using genome data from the 27 haploid species and the subgenome data from the three hybrid genome species. It was a high-quality tree with 100% bootstrap support for all of the branches. The genome-based tree provided superior resolution compared with previous multi-gene analyses. Although our backbone tree does not include all Trichosporonales genera (e.g. Cryptotrichosporon), it will be valuable for future analyses of genome data. Interest in interspecies hybrid fungal genomes has recently increased because they may provide a basis for new technologies. The three Trichosporonales hybrid genomes described in this study are different from well-characterized hybrid genomes (e.g. those of Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces bayanus) because these hybridization events probably occurred in the distant evolutionary past. Hence, they will be useful for studying genome stability following hybridization and speciation events. Copyright  2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Increased indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity is associated with poor clinical outcome in adults hospitalized with influenza in the INSIGHT FLU003Plus study  The Author(s) 2018.Background. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) mediated tryptophan (TRP) depletion has antimicrobial and immuno-regulatory effects. Increased kynurenine (KYN)-to-TRP (KT) ratios, reflecting increased IDO activity, have been associated with poorer outcomes from several infections. Methods. We performed a case-control (1:2; age and sex matched) analysis of adults hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 with protocol-defined disease progression (died/transferred to ICU/mechanical ventilation) after enrollment (cases) or survived without progression (controls) over 60 days of follow-up. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between baseline KT ratio and other metabolites and disease progression. Results. We included 32 cases and 64 controls with a median age of 52 years; 41% were female, and the median durations of influenza symptoms prior to hospitalization were 8 and 6 days for cases and controls, respectively (P = .04). Median baseline KT ratios were 2-fold higher in cases (0.24 mM/M; IQR, 0.13-0.40) than controls (0.12; IQR, 0.09-0.17; P ≤ .001). When divided into tertiles, 59% of cases vs 20% of controls had KT ratios in the highest tertile (0.21-0.84 mM/M). When adjusted for symptom duration, the odds ratio for disease progression for those in the highest vs lowest tertiles of KT ratio was 9.94 (95% CI, 2.25-43.90). Conclusions. High KT ratio was associated with poor outcome in adults hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The clinical utility of this biomarker in this setting merits further exploration."
"Differences in taste perception and spicy preference: A thai-japanese cross-cultural study  The Author(s) 2017.Taste perception is influenced by several factors. However, the relation between taste perception and food culture is unclear. This study compared taste thresholds between populations with different food culture, i.e. Thai and Japanese. A matched case-control study was conducted in 168 adults (84 for each; aged between 50 and 90 years). The age, sex, systemic disease, medication, smoking, xerostomia, and oral hygiene of both groups were not different. Recognition thresholds (RTs) of sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami were measured using filter paper disc (FPD). Detection taste thresholds were measured using electrogustometry. Spicy preference was measured by calibrated questionnaires. Higher RTs of all tastes and higher detection taste thresholds were found in Thai as compared to those of Japanese (P < 0.0001). Separate analyses of healthy and unhealthy persons confirmed the significant differences between 2 countries. The average thresholds for sweet, salty, sour, and bitter in Thai and Japanese were 4 and 2, respectively. The average threshold for umami in Thai and Japanese was 5 and 3, respectively. Moreover, Thai population had stronger preference for spicy food (P < 0.0001) with 70% mild- or moderate and 10% strong lovers, compared to over 90% non- or mild-spicy lovers in Japanese. In addition, 70% of Thai consumed spicy food weekly, whilst 80% of Japanese consumed it monthly. Our findings suggested that population with stronger spicy preference such as Thai had much poorer taste sensitivity and perception than that with milder preference like Japanese. Extensive international survey is needed to conclude the influence of food culture on taste perception."
"Who Decides: Me or We? Family Involvement in Medical Decision Making in Eastern and Western Countries  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.Background. Research suggests that desired family involvement (FI) in medical decision making may depend on cultural values. Unfortunately, the field lacks cross-cultural studies that test this assumption. As a result, providers may be guided by incomplete information or cultural biases rather than patient preferences. Methods. Researchers developed 6 culturally relevant disease scenarios varying from low to high medical seriousness. Quota samples of approximately 290 middle-aged urban residents in Australia, China, Malaysia, India, South Korea, Thailand, and the USA completed an online survey that examined desired levels of FI and identified individual difference predictors in each country. All reliability coefficients were acceptable. Regression models met standard assumptions. Results. The strongest finding across all 7 countries was that those who desired higher self-involvement (SI) in medical decision making also wanted lower FI. On the other hand, respondents who valued relational-interdependence tended to want their families involved – a key finding in 5 of 7 countries. In addition, in 4 of 7 countries, respondents who valued social hierarchy desired higher FI. Other antecedents were less consistent. Conclusion. These results suggest that it is important for health providers to avoid East–West cultural stereotypes. There are meaningful numbers of patients in all 7 countries who want to be individually involved and those individuals tend to prefer lower FI. On the other hand, more interdependent patients are likely to want families involved in many of the countries studied. Thus, individual differences within culture appear to be important in predicting whether a patient desires FI. For this reason, avoiding culture-based assumptions about desired FI during medical decision making is central to providing more effective patient centered care."
"Evaluation of alcohol screening and community-based brief interventions in rural western Kenya: A quasi-experimental study  The Author 2017. Medical Council on Alcohol and Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Aims: To assess the effectiveness of community-based alcohol brief interventions (ABI) implemented by community-health workers with and without motivational talks (MT) by former drinkers, in reducing harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption.Methods: We conducted a three-arm quasi-experimental study (one control and two intervention groups) between May and December 2015 in Kakamega County, Kenya. Participants were hazardous or harmful alcohol drinkers with an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 8-19 at baseline. One intervention group received only ABI while the other received ABI + MT. The interventions' effects on AUDIT scores were analysed using linear mixed models. Logistic regression was used to analyse the interventions' effects on low-risk drinking (AUDIT score <8) after 6 months.Results: The study included 161 participants: 52 in the control group, 52 in the only ABI group and 57 in the ABI + MT group. The mean AUDIT scores were lower in the intervention groups at 1, 3 and 6 months post-intervention; the ABI + MT group showed a greater reduction. The mean AUDIT scores over a 6-month period were lower in both intervention groups compared with the control group. The odds of low-risk drinking were almost two times higher in both intervention groups than in the control group, although the effect of only ABI on low-risk drinking was not significant.Conclusions: ABI + MT and only ABI were associated with a reduced mean AUDIT score among hazardous and high-risk drinkers in this resource-limited setting. ABI + MT was also associated with low-risk drinking in this population.Short summary: Community-based alcohol brief interventions implemented by community-health workers accompanied by motivational talks by former drinkers were associated with reduced hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption in a rural setting in western Kenya."
"Neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility and neuraminidase enzyme kinetics of human influenza A and B viruses circulating in Thailand in 2010–2015  2018 Tewawong et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Amino acid substitutions within or near the active site of the viral neuraminidase (NA) may affect influenza virus fitness. In influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses circulating in Thailand between 2010 and 2015, we identified several NA substitutions that were previously reported to be associated with reduced inhibition by NA inhibitors (NAIs). To study the effect of these substitutions on the enzymatic properties of NA and on virus characteristics, we generated recombinant influenza viruses possessing either a wild type (WT) NA or an NA with a single I222V, S331G, or S331R substitution [in influenza A(H3N2) viruses] or a single D342S, A395T, A395V, or A395D NA substitution (in influenza B viruses). We generated recombinant (7:1) influenza A and B viruses on the genetic background of A/Puerto Rico/8/ 1934 (A/PR/8, H1N1) or B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (B/YAM) viruses, respectively. In contrast to the expected phenotypes, all the recombinant influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses carrying putative NA resistance substitutions were susceptible to NAIs. The Km and Vmax for the NAs of A/PR8-S331G and A/PR8-S331R viruses were higher than for the NA of WT virus, and the corresponding values for the B/YAM-D342S virus were lower than for the NA of WT virus. Although there was initial variation in the kinetics of influenza A and B viruses’ replication in MDCK cells, their titers were comparable to each other and to WT viruses at later time points. All introduced substitutions were stable except for B/YAM-D342S and B/YAM-A395V which reverted to WT sequences after three passages. Our data suggest that inferring susceptibility to NAIs based on sequence information alone should be cautioned. The impact of NA substitution on NAI resistance, viral growth, and enzymatic properties is viral context dependent and should be empirically determined."
"In vitro cytotoxicity of carbon black nanoparticles synthesized from solution plasma on human lung fibroblast cells  2018 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.Carbon black nanoparticles (CB-NPs) have been synthesized from liquid benzene by a solution plasma method at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The morphological observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed the agglomeration of aggregated fine particles. The synthesized CB-NPs were predominantly amorphous as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The in vitro cytotoxicity of CB-NPs on the human lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cell line was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and systematically compared with those of two types of commercial carbon blacks (i.e., Vulcan XC-72 and Ketjenblack EC-600JD). Cell viabilities were studied at different concentrations of 32.5, 65, 125, and 250 μg/mL. It was found that the CB-NPs derived from solution plasma exhibited a lower cytotoxicity on the MRC-5 cells than the other two comparative carbon blacks. The viability of MRC-5 cells exposed to CB-NPs remained higher than 90% even at a high concentration of 250 μg/mL. This result preliminarily confirmed the biosafety and potential use of CB-NPs in the field of biological applications."
"Degradation of chitosan hydrogel dispersed in dilute carboxylic acids by solution plasma and evaluation of anticancer activity of degraded products  2018 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.Chitosan is a polysaccharide that has been extensively studied in the field of biomedicine, especially its water-soluble degraded products called chitooligosaccharides (COS). In this study, COS were produced by the degradation of chitosan hydrogel dispersed in a dilute solution (i.e., 1.55 mM) of various kinds of carboxylic acids using a non-thermal plasma technology called solution plasma (SP). The degradation rates of chitosan were influenced by the type of carboxylic acids, depending on the interaction between chitosan and each carboxylic acid. After SP treatment, the water-soluble degraded products containing COS could be easily separated from the water-insoluble residue of chitosan hydrogel by centrifugation. The production yields of the COS were mostly higher than 55%. Furthermore, the obtained COS products were evaluated for their inhibitory effect as well as their selectivity against human lung cancer cells (H460) and human lung normal cells (MRC-5)."
"Comparison of four human papillomavirus genotyping methods: Next-generation sequencing, INNO-LiPA, electrochemical DNA Chip, and nested-PCR Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes cervical cancer, thus necessitating early detection by screening. Rapid and accurate HPV genotyping is crucial both for the assessment of patients with HPV infection and for surveillance studies. Methods: Fifty-eight cervicovaginal samples were tested for HPV genotypes using four methods in parallel: nested-PCR followed by conventional sequencing, INNO-LiPA, electrochemical DNA chip, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Results: Seven HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 56, and 58) were identified by all four methods. Nineteen HPV genotypes were detected by NGS, but not by nested-PCR, INNO-LiPA, or electrochemical DNA chip. Conclusions: Although NGS is relatively expensive and complex, it may serve as a sensitive HPV genotyping method. Because of its highly sensitive detection of multiple HPV genotypes, NGS may serve as an alternative for diagnostic HPV genotyping in certain situations."
"Exploring the effects of authentic leadership on academic optimism and teacher engagement in Thailand  2018,  Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: In the context of Thailand’s progress towards education reform, scholars have identified a lack of effective school-level leadership as an impeding factor. The purpose of this paper is to develop and validate a theoretical model of authentic leadership effects on teacher academic optimism and work engagement. Authentic leadership was considered a suitable model of school leadership in light of Thailand’s explicit recognition of the importance of developing the moral capacity of students and emphasis on ethical leadership. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional survey design. Survey data were obtained from 605 teachers in a nationally representative sample of 182 primary schools. The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicated that the model of authentic leadership effects on teachers’ academic optimism and work engagement was validated. A moderate relationship was observed between authentic leadership and the dependent measures of teacher attitudes. Practical implications: The study identified a potentially important lack of alignment between the espoused values and actions/decisions of school principals in Thailand. When combined with prior research conducted on leadership for educational reform in Thailand, our findings highlight the systemic nature of the problem faced in changing traditional patterns of behavior in Thai schools. More specifically, despite change in the nation’s educational goals, human resource management of the nation’s school leaders continues to produce administrators and managers rather than leaders, either instructional or moral. Originality/value: The study extends prior studies of school leadership in the context of Thailand’s education reform that focused more specifically on principal instructional leadership in Thailand. In addition, this study of authentic school leadership is one of only a few conducted outside of Western societies."
"Effects of High-Intensity Intermittent Training on Vascular Function in Obese Preadolescent Boys  Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.Background: High-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) may serve as an effective alternative to traditional endurance training, since HIIT has been shown to induce greater improvements in aerobic fitness and health-related markers in adult populations. Our objective was to determine whether HIIT and supramaximal high-intensity intermittent training (supra-HIIT) would improve vascular structure and function in obese preadolescent boys. Methods: Before the baseline testing, 48 obese preadolescent boys, aged 8-12 years, were randomly assigned into control (CON; n = 16), HIIT (8 × 2 minutes at 90% peak power output, n = 16), and supra-HIIT (8 × 20 seconds at 170% peak power output, n = 16) groups. Both exercise groups performed exercises on a cycle ergometer three times/week for 12 weeks. Results: After 12 weeks, both HIIT and supra-HIIT did not affect body mass, body fat percentage, and waist circumference. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) increased in both HIIT and supra-HIIT groups (p < 0.05). Both HIIT and supra-HIIT groups had higher resting metabolic rate than the control group (p < 0.05). A measure of arterial stiffness, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and carotid intima-media thickness decreased after 12 weeks of HIIT and supra-HIIT program (all p < 0.05). Flow-mediated dilation, a measure of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, increased in both HIIT and supra-HIIT groups (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: It is concluded that both HIIT and supra-HIIT have favorable effects on aerobic capacity, metabolic rate, vascular function and structure, and blood lipid profile in obese preadolescent boys. HIIT may be a time efficient and effective exercise for preventing future cardiovascular disease in obese children."

"Effectiveness of the Simultaneous Stretching of the Achilles Tendon and Plantar Fascia in Individuals With Plantar Fasciitis  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.Background: Since the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon are anatomically connected, it is plausible that stretching of both structures simultaneously will result in a better outcome for plantar fasciitis. Methods: Fifty participants aged 40 to 60 years with a history of plantar fasciitis greater than 1 month were recruited. They were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 was instructed to stretch the Achilles tendon while group 2 simultaneously stretched the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia. Results: After 4 weeks of both stretching protocols, participants in group 2 demonstrated a significantly greater pressure pain threshold than participants in group 1 (P =.040) with post hoc analysis. No significant differences between groups were demonstrated in other variables (P >.05). Concerning within-group comparisons, both interventions resulted in significant reductions in pain at first step in the morning and average pain at the medial plantar calcaneal region over the past 24 hours, while there were increases in the pressure pain threshold, visual analog scale–foot and ankle score, and range of motion in ankle dorsiflexion (P <.001). More participants in group 2 described their symptoms as being much improved to being completely improved than those in group 1. Conclusion: The simultaneous stretching of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia for 4 weeks was a more effective intervention for plantar fasciitis. Patients who reported complete relief from symptoms at the end of the 4-week intervention in the simultaneous stretching group (n = 14; 56%) were double that of the stretching of the Achilles tendon–only group (n = 7; 28%). Level of Evidence: II, lesser quality RCT or prospective comparative study."
"Male white-handed gibbons flexibly time duet contributions  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: Vocal duetting occurs when two individuals produce repeated, stereotyped vocalizations, often with alternating contributions. It evolved independently in many pair living taxa. Among hominoids, only hylobatids duet, but little is known about how mated pairs coordinate singing and if individuals adjust their song to spectral and temporal aspects of another’s song. If they do, this would demonstrate vocal flexibility not yet well documented in apes. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed duets of wild white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar), quantifying female notes and the timing of male notes relative to them. We measured changes in female notes that preceded her great call phrase and that she initiated only after her mate had stopped singing. We predicted males would suspend their own song during a female’s great call phrase in anticipation of her climax, and thus should interrupt abnormal female calls, because these typically fail to climax. We compared (1) interrupted great call phrases females aborted, (2) interrupted phrases that were completed, and (3) uninterrupted, completed phrases. We found that abnormal great call phrases were interrupted by males, likely because the male anticipated that the phrase would be abandoned before reaching its climax. Although female call phrases varied in length, we also found that males replied in close synchrony with their ending. Subtle spectral and temporal variations in song influenced the timing of a mate’s singing and thus the structure and delivery of duets. Although ape vocal behavior is thought to be largely innate, our findings show unexpected flexibility in song expression. Significance statement: Vocal duets by mated pairs occur in many animal species but only in one ape family, the hylobatids (gibbons and siamang). Although gibbon duetting has been described for many species, little is still known about how partners coordinate singing. We show that individuals rapidly and flexibly adjust their song in direct response to changes in a mate’s singing. This coordinated adjustment to a mate’s ongoing singing likely allows for precise turn-taking during duets, which centers around the female great call phrase, and especially its climax notes. Although vocalizations of nonhuman apes are thought to be largely developmentally fixed, this plasticity suggests that turn-taking duets may be an exception. Turn-taking duetting requires gibbons to adjust their singing to that of the partner, perhaps similar to vocal exchange behaviors that contributed to increased flexibility in the precursors of speech."
"Stalagmites from western Thailand: preliminary investigations and challenges for palaeoenvironmental research  2017 Collegium Boreas. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdLocating suitable caves and stalagmites for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic studies can be challenging. Isotopic geochemical analyses, albeit commonly performed for palaeoclimatic reconstruction, are also time consuming and costly. Therefore, petrographic and non-destructive morphological studies on speleothems are desirable to facilitate sample selection for further analysis. In this study, 20 caves were surveyed in Ban Rai district, Uthai Thani province in western Thailand. After external physical observations in the field, three stalagmite samples were collected from Tham Nam Cave to test their potential for palaeoclimatic research. Firstly, the stalagmites were scanned by X-ray computed tomography (CT scanning) and subsequently the CT images were compared with petrographic inspections. Columnar fabrics show the highest density, whereas closed and open dendritic fabrics have medium and the lowest densities, respectively. Layers near the top and bottom of the three stalagmites were dated by U-Th mass spectrometric techniques. All three samples were deposited between c. 87 and c. 105 ka ago; therefore, they are probably the oldest stalagmites that have been reported so far from mainland Southeast Asia. However, their physical features indicate that all the samples have suffered from postdepositional dissolution, and are unlikely to be suitable for palaeoclimatic research. The internal dissolution feature of stalagmites, however, cannot be identified by visual inspection of uncut samples. We hereby argue that CT images are useful to characterize stalagmite petrography, in particular fabric, porosity and density. Such features can be used to select the ideal plane of a stalagmite for sectioning, to maximize the chances of robust climatic reconstruction."
"The viability of single cancer cells after exposure to hydrodynamic shear stresses in a spiral microchannel: A canine cutaneous mast cell tumor model  2017 by the authors.Our laboratory has the fundamental responsibility to study cancer stem cells (CSC) in various models of human and animal neoplasms. However, the major impediments that spike our accomplishment are the lack of universal biomarkers and cellular heterogeneity. To cope with these restrictions, we have tried to apply the concept of single cell analysis, which has hitherto been recommended throughout the world as an imperative solution pack for resolving such dilemmas. Accordingly, our first step was to utilize a predesigned spiral microchannel fabricated by our laboratory to perform size-based single cell separation using mast cell tumor (MCT) cells as a model. However, the impact of hydrodynamic shear stresses (HSS) on mechanical cell injury and viability in a spiral microchannel has not been fully investigated so far. Intuitively, our computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has strongly revealed the formations of fluid shear stress (FSS) and extensional fluid stress (EFS) in the sorting system. The panel of biomedical assays has also disclosed cell degeneration and necrosis in the model. Therefore, we have herein reported the combinatorically detrimental effect of FSS and EFS on the viability of MCT cells after sorting in our spiral microchannel, with discussion on the possibly pathogenic mechanisms of HSS-induced cell injury in the study model."
"Forecasting economic, social and environmental growth in the sanitary and service sector based on Thailand's sustainable development policy The purpose of this study is to forecast the long run implementation of Thailand's sustainable development policy in three main aspects, including economic, social and environmental aspect for the the sanitary and service sectors from 2016 until 2045. According to the national data for the years 2000-2015, based on the ARIMAX model, it has been found that Thai economy system is potentially changed and growing rapidly by 25.76%, the population has grown by 7.15%, and the Greenhouse gas emissions will gradually increase by 49.65%, in the year 2045. However, based on the analysis above, if Thailand fails to run the afore-mentioned policy properly, it will be difficult to successfully implement sustainable development, because the increased emission is moving in the same direction with economy and social aspect of Thailand."
"Cycloartobiloxanthone induces human lung cancer cell apoptosis via mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway Background: Lung cancer is one of most malignant types of cancer and new anticancer agents are still required. Cycloartobiloxanthone, a flavonoid isolated from stem bark of Artocarpus gomezianus, has potential for being developed for anticancer therapy. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity of cycloartobiloxanthone was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay against four human lung cancer cell lines (H23, H460, H292 and A549) and their half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were assessed. Apoptotic induction in H460 cells was investigated by Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay and protein hallmarks of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway were examined by western blot analysis. Results: Cycloartobiloxanthone exhibited potent cytotoxic effect on both small and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Nuclear Hoechst/PI staining revealed that apoptotic cell death was the main mechanism of toxicity of cycloartobiloxanthone. The apoptosis-inducing potency of cycloartobiloxanthone was comparable to those of standard anticancer drugs cisplatin and etoposide at the same concentration. Protein analysis further showed that apoptosis was mediated via mitochondria-dependent pathway. p53 was activated in cells treated with cycloartobiloxanthone. Subsequently, pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-associated X protein (BAX) was found to be significantly increased, concomitantly with the decrease of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1). Moreover, markers of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, namely activated caspase-9, activated caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), dramatically increased in cycloartobiloxanthone-treated cells compared to the non-treated controls. Conclusion: Cycloartobiloxanthone has anticancer activity against human lung cancer cells by triggering mitochondrial apoptotic caspase-dependent mechanism. This compound might have promising effects for cancer therapy."
"Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 attenuates gut translocationinduced bacterial sepsis in murine models of leaky gut  2017 American Society for Microbiology.Gastrointestinal (GI) bacterial translocation in sepsis is well known, but the role of Lactobacillus species probiotics is still controversial. We evaluated the therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 in a new sepsis model of oral administration of pathogenic bacteria with GI leakage induced by either an antibiotic cocktail (ATB) and/or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). GI leakage with ATB, DSS, and DSS plus ATB (DSS+ATB) was demonstrated by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- dextran translocation to the circulation. The administration of pathogenic bacteria, either Klebsiella pneumoniae or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, enhanced translocation. Bacteremia was demonstrated within 24 h in 50 to 88% of mice with GI leakage plus the administration of pathogenic bacteria but not with GI leakage induction alone or bacterial gavage alone. Salmonella bacteremia was found in only 16 to 29% and 0% of mice with Salmonella and Klebsiella administrations, respectively. Klebsiella bacteremia was demonstrated in 25 to 33% and 10 to 16% of mice with Klebsiella and Salmonella administrations, respectively. Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 attenuated GI leakage in these models, as shown by the reductions of FITC-dextran gut translocation, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, bacteremia, and sepsis mortality. The reduction in the amount of fecal Salmonella bacteria with Lactobacillus treatment was demonstrated. In addition, an anti-inflammatory effect of the conditioned medium from Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 was also demonstrated by the attenuation of cytokine production in colonic epithelial cells in vitro. In conclusion, Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 attenuated the severity of symptoms in a murine sepsis model induced by GI leakage and the administration of pathogenic bacteria."
"Helicobacter pylori management in ASEAN: The Bangkok consensus report  2017 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection remains to be the major cause of important upper gastrointestinal diseases such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.

"Effect of the blow-up ratio on morphology and engineering properties of three-layered linear low-density polyethylene blown films  2017,  The Author(s) 2017.A series of linear low-density polyethylene films were produced using a three-layer co-extrusion machine. How the blow-up ratio and resin characteristics affected the final film morphology and engineering properties were studied. The crystalline morphology and orientation during the blown film process of the low-density polyethylene film were investigated using small-angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Increasing the blow-up ratio increased the transverse direction molecular orientation and decreased the machine direction orientation. The resulting low-density polyethylene morphology was a regular lamellar stacking parallel to the machine direction. The film morphology strongly influenced the mechanical properties. Increasing the blow-up ratio from 1.7 to 2.8 decreased the machine direction tensile strength by 14% and increased the transverse direction tensile strength up to 27% for both the low-density polyethylene/1-butene and low-density polyethylene/1-octene co-monomers, while the machine direction tear strength increased up to 36% and the transverse direction decreased by 16%. Moreover, the first and second heating characteristics from differential scanning calorimeter showed the inherent crystallinity change with increasing blow-up ratio for both the low-density polyethylene/1-octene and the low-density polyethylene/1-butene copolymer. The crystalline orientation changes induced with increasing blow-up ratio affected the film water vapor and oxygen permeability."
"Ability of artificial and live houseplants to capture indoor particulate matter  2016,  The Author(s) 2016.Two artificial and three live houseplants were assessed for their abilities to capture particulate matter smaller than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) generated by burning an incense stick. The test plants included polyester Boston fern, polyethylene Dieffenbachia, Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum), Painted nettle (Plectranthus scutellarioides) and Rainbow tree (Dracaena cincta Bak. ‘Tricolor’). Each plant was tested one at a time in a closed 8-m3 chamber, and the PM2.5 concentrations were continuously measured for 24 h. A loss rate constant for PM2.5 due to deposition onto leaf surface was determined by fitting measured concentrations to a mass balance model using nonlinear regression. The PM2.5 loss rates for the artificial Boston fern correlated well with its total leaf surface areas at the significant level of 0.5. All studied plants had PM2.5 loss rates ranging from 0.05 to 0.08 h−1 under the testing condition of similar total leaf surface areas, while a PM2.5 loss rate due to deposition onto the chamber surfaces was 0.03 h−1. Stereo microscope leaf images revealed the particle accumulation mostly on the midribs and veins rather than the flat blades, while the woven polyester fabric of the artificial plant acts as a filter for collecting the coarse particles."
"Dichlorocarbene modified butadiene rubber (DCBR): Preparation, kinetic study, and its properties in natural rubber/DCBR blend vulcanizates Copyright  2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Dichlorocarbene modified butadiene rubber (DCBR) was prepared via the addition of the dichlorocarbene group in the presence of 2 phase transfer agents (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and tetraethylammonium chloride). The effects of the reaction temperature and time, amount of dichlorocarbene precursor, and the type and amount of phase transfer agent on the chlorine content were investigated. The highest chlorine content (30%) in DCBR was obtained using 0.062 mol chloroform and 0.003 mol cetyltrimethylammonium bromide at room temperature for 19 hours although 27.9% was obtained after 12 hours. The kinetics of this dichlorocarbene modification was best described by the pseudo–first order rate law with 2 rate constants. For practical applications, the DCBR with chlorine contents of 10%, 20%, or 30% were blended with natural rubber (NR) and then vulcanized using the sulfur-curing system. Although the polarity of DCBR was increased, a good compatibility between NR and DCBR still existed, resulting in improved mechanical properties. The oil resistance, flame retardant, and ozone resistance properties of the NR/DCBR blend vulcanizates were enhanced compared to those of a NR/butadiene rubber blend vulcanizate, which was related to the amount of chlorine incorporated into the DCBR."
"Detecting allergens from black tiger shrimp penaeus monodon that can bind and cross-link IgE by ELISA, western blot, and a humanized rat basophilic leukemia reporter cell line RS-ATL8  Copyright The Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology.Purpose: Black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon is one of the common causes of shellfish allergy that is increasing worldwide. One of the important problems in the management of shellfish allergy is the lack of accurate diagnostic assay because the biological and immunological properties of allergens in black tiger shrimp have not been well characterized. This study aims to detect proteins with the ability to bind and cross-link immunoglobulin E (IgE) from black tiger shrimp by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and a humanized rat basophilic leukemia reporter cell line RS-ATL8. Methods: Sera from shrimp allergic subjects were subjected to ELISA and Western blots using raw or cooked shrimp extract as antigens. Pooled sera were used to sensitize the RS-ATL8 reporter cell line and cells were activated by shrimp extract. Eluted protein extracts separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were tested on the RS-ATL8 cell line and subjected to mass spectrometry to identify potential candidate allergens. Results: Allergic sera reacted stronger to raw shrimp extract than cooked shrimp extract (P=0.009). Western blot demonstrated that major IgE reactivity protein bands were at 32-39 kDa and 91-230 kDa in both raw and cooked shrimp extracts. The eluted protein bands at the molecular weight of 38 and 115 kDa from raw shrimp extract induced IgE cross-linking as assayed by the RS-ATL8 cell line. These protein bands were subjected to mass spectrometry for analysis. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme and crustacyanin were identified as potential candidate novel shrimp allergens. Conclusions: The RS-ATL8 reporter cell line can be used to identify potential new shrimp allergens that can functionally cross-link IgE and induce mast cell degranulation."
"Bringing context out of the shadows of leadership  2016,  The Author(s) 2016.Research on educational leadership and management has resulted in the accumulation of increasingly persuasive findings concerning the impact school leadership can have on school performance. Indeed, there is a growing consensus that there exists a generic set of leadership practices (e.g. goal setting, developing people) which must be adapted to meet the needs and constraints that describe different school contexts. However, to date, researchers have yet to develop a theory or report comprehensive findings on this challenge. This paper explores several types of school contexts (institutional, community, socio-cultural, political, economic, school improvement) and what we have learned about how they shape school leadership practice. The analysis leads to several conclusions and recommendations. First, it affirms, elaborates and extends the assertion made by scholars of the importance of examining leadership in context. Second, the need to contextualize leadership highlights deficiencies in modal research methods that focus on mean effects and either ignore context effects or relegate them to the shadows. Finally, the field needs to refine current research methods and explore new approaches that enable us to better study how successful leadership responds and adapts to different contexts."
"Genetic variation of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone 1931) culture of Thailand  2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdWhite spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is highly pathogenic to penaeid shrimp and has caused significant economic losses in the shrimp farming industry in Thailand. Genotyping analysis was done in 124 WSSV isolates from cultured Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. These samples were obtained during 2007–2014 from eight provinces in Thailand. We investigated five variable loci in the virus genome: deletions in two variable regions, VR14/15 and VR23/24, and three variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) located in open reading frame (ORF) 75, 125 and 94. WSSV genotype was characterized as (X14/15, X23/24) (N75-N125-N94) where X is the number of base pair deletion in the variable region and N is the number of repeat units (RUs) in a specific ORF. The deletion pattern in VR14/15 and VR23/24 regions characterized three WSSV genotypes. The most prevalent genotype was (595014/15, 1097123/24), and it was found in all studied areas. At least 33 genotypes of WSSV were analysed based on 3 VNTR loci, indicating that the VNTRs of WSSV genome are highly variable. From 124 WSSV samples, two samples presented the characteristic of all five variable loci similar to WSSV collected during 2010 in Saudi Arabia (595014/15, 1097123/24) (375-6125-794). Many different WSSV genotypes shown in this study as compared to previously reported genotypes in Thailand suggests current status of disease epidemiology, as well as probable movements of WSSV between countries."
"Spatial choice modeling using the support vector machine (SVM): Characterization and Prediction  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.We take a cursory look at the support vector machine (SVM) as a useful and effective algorithm for characterizing and predicting spatial choice problems in economics. Beginning with a discussion of the SVM for the linearly separable case as well as the nonlinear non-separable case using the soft margin SVM and kernels, we then describe how the SVM can be used to characterize and predict spatial choice models, which can be seen as a special case of discrete choice models, using examples from a simple 1-D to the more complex multi-dimensional features space."
"Ontology-Based Framework to Support Recommendation Rule Management Using Spreadsheet  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.Recommender system development for the Semantic Web data typically requires ontology, rules and rule-based inference engine to be applied over the RDF data. Rule creation is a critical process in supporting knowledge base building and typically must rely on knowledge engineers. This paper describes an ontology-based framework to support knowledge engineers and experts in managing recommendation rules using a spreadsheet application by using their own vocabulary instead of ontology terms. Decision table, ontology, vocabulary mapping configuration, and recommendation rule template are core components of the framework. The framework was successfully validated in a large-scale project using a case study of excise duty recommender system. Our work differs from existing systems in that it is designed for the Semantic Web data and uses a flexible recommendation rule template. Our framework also emphasizes the need for knowledge engineers and experts to use their own vocabulary in the decision tables. Thus, it hides the complexity both in terms of syntax and terminology, which would make rule management task more user-friendly."
"Temporal Trends Between 2010 and 2015 in Intensity of Care at End-of-Life for Patients With Chronic Illness: Influence of Age Under vs. Over 65 Years  2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative MedicineContext Recent analyses of Medicare data show decreases over time in intensity of end-of-life care. Few studies exist regarding trends in intensity of end-of-life care for those under 65 years of age. Objectives To examine recent temporal trends in place of death, and both hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, for age-stratified decedents with chronic, life-limiting diagnoses (<65 vs. ≥65 years) who received care in a large healthcare system. Methods Retrospective cohort using death certificates and electronic health records for 22,068 patients with chronic illnesses who died between 2010 and 2015. We examined utilization overall and stratified by age using multiple regression. Results The proportion of deaths at home did not change, but hospital admissions in the last 30 days of life decreased significantly from 2010 to 2015 (hospital b = −0.026; CI = −0.041, −0.012). ICU admissions in the last 30 days also declined over time for the full sample and for patients aged 65 years or older (overall b = −0.023; CI = −0.039, −0.007), but was not significant for younger decedents. Length of stay (LOS) did not decrease for those using the hospital or ICU. Conclusion From 2010 to 2015, we observed a decrease in hospital admissions for all age groups and in ICU admissions for those over 65 years. As there were no changes in the proportion of patients with chronic illness who died at home nor in hospital or ICU LOS in the last 30 days, hospital and ICU admissions in the last 30 days may be a more responsive quality metric than site of death or LOS for palliative care interventions."
"A novel frequency reuse technique for in-building small cells in dense heterogeneous networks  2017 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.In this paper, we address the important issue of reusing frequency resource in femtocells deployed in dense multi-floor buildings over a large urban macrocell coverage to enhance network capacity and spectral efficiency using almost blank subframe (ABS)-based enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) technique. Femtocell clustering and modeling an optimum number of ABS (OPNA) are, however, two major challenges to reuse frequency in femtocells deployed in buildings using ABS-based eICIC. In this paper, we address these challenges by exploiting the high external wall penetration loss of any buildings and in-between distance of neighboring buildings, and propose a femtocell clustering approach by considering all femtocells in any buildings as a femtocell cluster to avoid an additional computational complexity from clustering. We develop a frequency reuse and scheduling algorithm (FRSA) for an arbitrary number of ABSs for a multi-tier network, which consists of in-building femtocells and outdoor picocells in the coverage of an urban macrocell. We then propose a model for estimating the OPNA and derive an OPNA per femtocell cluster basis under two schemes, namely adaptive OPNA and non-adaptive OPNA, in order to vary the number of ABSs imposed on femtocells within a building dynamically based on the presence of indoor macrocell users within the building to avoid cross-tier interference with femtocells. An optimization algorithm for OPNA schemes is developed, and its implementation aspects are discussed. The impact of varying the number of ABSs and femtocells per building on the throughput performance of FRSA is analyzed through an extensive system-level simulation, and the capacity outperformance of the adaptive over the non-adaptive OPNA scheme is shown. Finally, a schematic of the scheduler implementation for FRSA is developed, and the capacity outperformance of FRSA over a number of existing works is shown.  2017 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

"Nonisothermal crystallization behavior of poly(butylene succinate)/NaY zeolite nanocomposites  2018, The Polymer Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is a biodegradable polymer widely employed in the industry and its microstructure is strongly determined by its crystallization. Consequently, this paper investigates the nonisothermal crystallization behavior of PBS nanocomposites filled with NaY zeolite. The samples were prepared by melt blending with the insertion of 1 and 2 wt% filler. The nonisothermal crystallization was investigated from differential scanning calorimetry, whereas the crystalline structure was studied by wide-angle X-ray diffraction and the morphology of spherulites was observed by Optical Microscopy. From these techniques, the crystallinity of PBS appeared to increase with the addition of zeolite and the crystals displayed a larger size. In the nonisothermal crystallization kinetics Avrami model was found to be applicable. Dobreva’s method highlighted the nucleating effect induced by the zeolite and the crystallization activation energy indicated a modification of the polymer chain diffusion. The results showed that the zeolite induced two simultaneous effects with promoting the nucleation and also the crystal chains expansion of PBS during its nonisothermal crystallization.

"Gastrointestinal Colonization of Candida Albicans Increases Serum (1 → 3)-β-D-Glucan, without Candidemia, and Worsens Cecal Ligation and Puncture Sepsis in Murine Model  Copyright 2017 by the Shock Society.The role of intestinal Candida albicans in bacterial sepsis, in the absence of candidemia, was investigated in murine models. Live C albicans or normal saline solution (NSS) was administered orally once, followed by 5 days of daily oral antibiotic-mixtures (ATB). Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was then performed to induce sepsis. Fecal Candida was detected by culture only in models with Candida administration. Oral Candida administration with/without ATB enhanced gut-pathogenic bacteria as determined by microbiome analysis. Despite negative candidemia, serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) was higher in CLP with Candida preconditioning models than in CLP-controls (NSS-preconditioning) at 6 and/or 18 h post-CLP. Blood bacterial burdens were not increased with Candida administration. Additionally, CLP with high-dose Candida (10 6 colony forming units) induced higher levels of fecal Candida, serum BG, serum IL-6, and mortality than the lowest dose (100 colony forming units). Interestingly, fluconazole attenuated fecal Candida and improved survival in mice with live-Candida administration, but not in the CLP-controls. Heat-killed Candida preparations or their supernatants reduced bone marrow-derived macrophage killing activity in vitro but enhanced cytokine production. In conclusion, intestinal abundance of fungi and/or fungal-molecules was associated with increased bacterial sepsis severity, perhaps through cytokine storm induction and/or decreased macrophage killing activity. These observations suggest that further investigation of the potential role of intestinal fungal burdens in sepsis is warranted."
"Cepharanthine exhibits a potent anticancer activity in p53-mutated colorectal cancer cells through upregulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 Cepharanthine (CEP), a biscoclurine alkaloid isolated from Stephania cepharantha Hayata, has demonstrated anticancer activity in several different types of cancer cells. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in both men and women. Mutated p53 in CRC was reported to be associated with resistance to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents including, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Many studies reported that mutation of p53 induced chemoresistance through several mechanisms, including induction of drug efflux, disruption of cell cycle regulation, evasion of apoptosis and upregulation of DNA repair. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity of CEP in p53 mutant versus p53 wild-Type colorectal cancer cells and determine its underlying mechanisms of action. Our results showed that CEP induced colorectal cancer cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Remarkably, CEP was more effective in controlling the growth of the p53 mutant colorectal cancer cell lines, HT-29 and SW-620, than the p53 wild-Type colorectal cancer cell lines, COLO-205 and HCT-116. Further studies on the underlying mechanisms revealed that CEP could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in both HT-29 and COLO-205 cells. Treatment with CEP dramatically increased p21 Waf1/Cip1expression levels of the p53 mutant cell line HT-29 and to a lesser extent, the p53 wild-Type cell line COLO-205. In addition, cyclin A and Bcl-2 expression levels of both cell lines were significantly downregulated following treatment with CEP. CEP also induced ROS formation in colorectal cancer cells. Taken together, we concluded that CEP effectively induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which may be mediated through upregulation of p21Waf1/Cip1, downregulation of cyclin A and Bcl-2 and induction of ROS production in colorectal cancer cells. These findings suggested that CEP could potentially be a novel anticancer agent for p53 mutant colorectal cancer cells which are often resistant to current chemotherapeutic agents."
"Aberrant expression of CD20 in thyroid cancer and its clinicopathologic significance  2017 Elsevier Inc.CD20 is the first-line diagnostic marker of B-cells, which serves as the target of the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. Recently, aberrant CD20 expression has been described in a small series of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). We aimed to evaluate CD20 immunoexpression and to perform clinicopathologic correlation in a large set of thyroid tumors, including a cohort of high-grade thyroid cancer. A total of 625 cases of thyroid tumor comprised tissue microarrays of 538 PTCs and 47 follicular adenomas, and whole-slide sections of 40 aggressive thyroid carcinomas (10 radioiodine-refractory PTCs and 8 poorly differentiated, 5 anaplastic, and 17 medullary thyroid carcinomas) were immunostained with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. BRAFV600E mutation was tested by direct sequencing in 478 cancers. Our study found that a small subset of PTCs (<10%, mainly of classic variant) exhibited aberrant membranous expression of CD20. These tumors displayed less aggressive histological features and had a lower prevalence of BRAFV600E mutation. We also discovered that CD20 expression was maintained in 6%-20% of aggressive thyroid cancers but not observed in follicular adenomas. All CD20-positive tumor cells were negative for CD79a and PAX5. Aberrant expression of CD20 by thyroid cancer cells may present a diagnostic pitfall in cytologic evaluation of thyroid and cervical masses. Residual expression of CD20 in aggressive cancers may offer promise for translational implications, which merits further experimental investigation."
"Scaling-up bio-hydrogen production from food waste: Feasibilities and challenges  2017Hydrogen has potential as a renewable energy source due to its outstanding clean energy content.

Currently, the knowledge of hydrogen production from food waste by dark fermentation is still limited in a laboratory scale. This article intends to provide up-to-date status quo on this technology. Factors affecting production potential, appropriate condition of production, feasibility of scaled-up production and economic value analysis of such technology is summarized and analyzed."
"Electrochemical performance assessment of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes  2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCIn this work, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on different electrolytes, i.e., the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and the samaria-doped ceria (SDC), were investigated to study their performances at low-temperature operation. The predicted performance of both SOFCs was validated with the experimental results. The verified models were implemented to study the impact of operating conditions, i.e., cell temperature, pressure, thicknesses of cathode, anode, and electrolyte, on their performances. The decrease in the operating temperature from intermediate range (800–900 °C) to low range (550–650 °C) has a considerable effect on the performance of the YSZ-based SOFC as conventional type, which dropped from 0.67–1.40 W/cm2 to 0.027–0.13 W/cm2. Under the low operating temperature range, the performance of SDC-based SOFC was superior to that of the YSZ-based SOFC, due to the lower ohmic loss. Nevertheless, the SDC-based SOFC has higher concentration overpotentials than the YSZ-based SOFC. The concentration overpotentials of the SDC-based SOFC can be reduced by the thinner anode and cathode thicknesses. In addition, the SDC-based SOFC at low operating temperature with the pressurized operation could significantly improve its power density, about 20% at 2 bar, which was close to that of YSZ-based SOFC at intermediate temperature of 800 °C."
"Analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell and a molten carbonate fuel cell integrated system with different configurations  2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCA solid oxide fuel cell with internal reforming operation is run at partial fuel utilization; thus, the remaining fuel can be further used for producing additional power. In addition, the exhaust gas of a solid oxide fuel cell still contains carbon dioxide, which is the primary greenhouse gas, and identifying a way to utilize this carbon dioxide is important. Integrating the solid oxide fuel cell with the molten carbonate fuel cell is a potential solution for carbon dioxide utilization. In this study, the performance of the integrated fuel cell system is analyzed. The solid oxide fuel cell is the main power generator, and the molten carbonate fuel cell is regarded as a carbon dioxide concentrator that produces electricity as a by-product. Modeling of the solid oxide fuel cell and the molten carbonate fuel cell is based on one-dimensional mass balance, considering all cell voltage losses. Primary operating conditions of the integrated fuel cell system that affect the system efficiencies in terms of power generation and carbon dioxide utilization are studied, and the optimal operating parameters are identified based on these criteria. Various configurations of the integrated fuel cell system are proposed and compared to determine the suitable design of the integrated fuel cell system."
"Variation in Radiologic and Urologic Computed Tomography Interpretation of Urinary Tract Stone Burden: Results From the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter  2017 Elsevier Inc.Objective To compare the measured stone burden recorded between urologists and radiologists, and examine how these differences could potentially impact stone management. As current urologic stone surgery guideline recommendations are based on stone size, accurate stone measurements are crucial to direct appropriate treatment. This study investigated the discrepant interpretation that often exists between urologic surgeons and radiologists’ estimation of patient urinary stone burden. Materials and Methods From November 2015 through August 2016, new patients prospectively enrolled into the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter (ReSKU) were included if they had computed tomography images available and an accompanying official radiologic report at the time of their urologist provider visit. Stone number and aggregate stone size were compared between the urologic interpretation and the corresponding radiologic reports. Results Of 219 patients who met the inclusion criteria, concordance between urologic and radiologic assessment of aggregate stone size was higher for single stone sizing (63%) compared with multiple stones (32%). Statistical significance was found in comparing the mean difference in aggregate stone size for single and multiple stones (P <.01). Over 33% of stone-containing renal units had a radiologic report with an unclear size estimation or size discrepancy that could lead to non–guideline-driven surgical management. Conclusion Significant variation exists between urologic and radiologic computed tomography interpretations of stone burden. Urologists should personally review patient imaging when considering stone surgical management. A standardized method for measuring and reporting stone parameters is needed among urologists and radiologists."
"The influence of emotional response to interior color on restaurant entry decision  2017 Elsevier LtdColor is one of the essential aesthetic design elements in restaurant setting due to its high impact on customer's emotional and behavioral responses. The purpose of this study is to explore the linkage between emotional response to interior color and restaurant entry decision. A total of 496 research participants evaluated eleven computer-generated restaurant scenes with different interior colors. Each participant was asked to evaluate his/her emotional responses on nine adjective pairs of the PAD emotion scale as well as his/her entry decision. Logistic regression models were derived to indicate the probability of entering the restaurant. Pleasure was found to be the best behavioral response predictor. Data analysis also showed that restaurant scenes with high value color and warm-tone color received higher scores for pleasure. This study concludes that to fully understand the effects of color on emotional and behavioral responses in restaurants, additional color attributes should be further examined."

A sample of 300 university alumni records was used to obtain their respective attribute values consisting of demographics, preferred communication channels, lifestyle, activities/interests, and expectation from university, needed information, donation willingness, and frequency of contact. The researcher used logistic regression and the k-mean clustering technique to analyze the data from the survey. Five segments could be derived from the analysis. Segment 3, the so-called “Mid Age Religious” contained the highest portion while segment 5, the so-called “Elaborate Cohort” had the least portion. Most of the population under these two segments was female. Differences were identified in age, marital status, education, occupation, position, income, experience, and field of work. The Elaborate Cohort segment represented young females having a bachelor degree, with low experience and low income, working for their first employer, and still enjoying being single. Another segment with similar values of attributes as the Elaborate Cohort was segment 1, the so-called “Activist Mainstreamer” whose field of work was computer technology. The segment called “Senior League” consisted of members older than 41 years like the Mid Age Religious segment, however all members were male. The last segment, the so-called “Passionate Learner” had members aged between 31 and 40 years. In conclusion, the results of this study can assist in formulating strategic marketing by alumni associations to satisfy and engage their alumni."
"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the quantitative/qualitative analysis of plant secondary metabolites  2017, The Author(s).Immunoassays are antibody-based analytical methods for quantitative/qualitative analysis. Since the principle of immunoassays is based on specific antigen–antibody reaction, the assays have been utilized worldwide for diagnosis, pharmacokinetic studies by drug monitoring, and the quality control of commercially available products. Berson and Yalow were the first to develop an immunoassay, known as radioimmunoassay (RIA), for detecting endogenous plasma insulin [1], a development for which Yalow was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1977. Even today, after half a century, immunoassays are widely utilized with some modifications from the originally proposed system, e.g., radioisotopes have been replaced with enzymes because of safety concerns regarding the use of radioactivity, which is referred to as enzyme immunoassay/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, progress has been made in ELISA with the recent advances in recombinant DNA technology, leading to increase in the range of antibodies, probes, and even systems. This review article describes ELISA and its applications for the detection of plant secondary metabolites."
"Uniformity of strained islands in heteroepitaxial thin film growth with patterned substrates: A fast kinetic Monte Carlo study  2017 Elsevier B.V.We study heteroepitaxial thin films grown on patterned substrates using a two-dimensional ball and spring model. Island size and its uniformity as a function of patterned substrate parameters and growth conditions are investigated in an early stage of growth using fast kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to the flat substrate, patterned substrates provide preferred sites for island formation at the beginning of growth and promote island size uniformity. A patterned substrate parameter enables us to modify island size in a considerable range. Island size uniformity is further enhanced by stress suppression at the island edges when lattice mismatch is increased. Island size, however, decreases as the growth temperature is increased due to the constraint of periodicity of patterned substrates imposed. An upper bound of a patterned substrate parameter before island size becomes less uniform seems to closely connect to island period and island edge spacing of the flat substrate."
"Ethnic differences in stratum corneum functions between Chinese and Thai infants residing in Bangkok, Thailand  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background/Objectives: Ethnic and racial differences in infant skin have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to establish whether there are ethnic differences and similarities in the stratum corneum (SC) functions of Thai and Chinese infants. Methods: Healthy infants 6 to 24 months of age (N = 60; 30 Thai, 30 Chinese) who resided in Bangkok, Thailand, were enrolled. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and SC hydration (capacitance) on the thigh, buttock, and upper arm were measured. Ceramide content was determined in the SC on the upper arm. Results: SC hydration was not remarkably different between the two ethnicities at any site measured, but TEWL was significantly higher in Chinese infants than in Thai infants at all sites. Hydration of the SC was not significantly correlated with age in either ethnicity. TEWL had significant but weak correlations with age on the thigh and upper arm in Thai infants. Ceramide content was significantly higher in Chinese SC than in Thai SC. No relationship between ceramide content and TEWL or hydration was observed in either ethnicity. Conclusion: The significant differences in TEWL and ceramide contents between Chinese and Thai infant skin could prove useful in designing skin care and diapering products that are best suited for each ethnicity."
"Molecular insights into inclusion complexes of mansonone E and H enantiomers with various β-cyclodextrins  2017 Elsevier Inc.The structural dynamics and stability of inclusion complexes of mansonone E (ME) and H (MH) including their stereoisomers with various βCDs (methylated- and hydroxypropylated-βCDs) were investigated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations. The simulation results revealed that mansonones are able to form inclusion complexes with βCDs. The guest molecules are not completely inserted into the host cavity, their preferably positions are nearby the secondary rim with the oxane ring dipping into the hydrophobic inner cavity. The encapsulation process leads to a higher rigidity of the βCDs enhancing the intramolecular hydrogen bond formation ability and decreasing the chance of glucopyranose rotation. According to the MM-PBSA binding free energy calculation, all considered inclusion complexes are stable and the binding energies are mainly caused by van der Waals interactions. Moreover, the free energy calculations showed significant differences in the complexation energies for the stereoisomers, which could enable the separation of the isomers by analytical techniques for further pharmaceutical applications."
"Reinforcement of Simulated Immature Permanent Teeth after Mineral Trioxide Aggregate Apexification  2017 American Association of EndodontistsObjectives The objectives of this study were to compare the fracture resistance of simulated human immature teeth that have undergone mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) apexification and have been root-filled with fiber post, composite resin, MTA, or gutta-percha. Methods Fifty-six human permanent maxillary incisors were selected. Ten teeth received no treatment (intact teeth group). The root canals of 46 teeth were prepared to an internal diameter of 1.75 mm. Six teeth were used as simulated immature teeth group. The remaining teeth received MTA apexification and were divided into 4 groups: MTA, fiber post, composite resin, and gutta-percha groups. The root canals of each group were filled with each test material. All teeth were thermocycled and received cyclic loading before compression testing by an Instron universal testing machine. The load to fracture was recorded. Data were subjected to statistical analysis by using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey multiple comparison test. Results All teeth fractured at the cervical area of the root. The mean load to fracture of the intact tooth, MTA, fiber post, composite resin, gutta-percha, and the simulated immature tooth groups was 1988 N, 1921 N, 1691 N, 1623 N, 1476 N, and 962 N, respectively. Statistically, load to fracture of the simulated immature tooth group was significantly lower than in the intact tooth, MTA, fiber post, and composite resin groups but was not significantly different from the gutta-percha group. Conclusions Within the limit of this study, after MTA apexification, intraradicular reinforcement with MTA, fiber post, or composite resin increased the fracture resistance of simulated immature teeth."
"Aberrant promoter methylation of the PAQR3 gene is associated with prostate cancer  2017 Elsevier GmbHMethylation markers are promising tools for diagnosis, prognosis and targeted treatment of cancer. In prostate carcinoma, aberrant promoter hypermethylation occurs earlier in the disease course and more consistently than recurrent somatic mutations. PAQR3, a tumor suppressor gene, was recently found to be downregulated in prostate cancer cell lines. We hypothesized that promoter methylation could be responsible for PAQR3 silencing in prostate cancer tissues. We aimed to investigate PAQR3 promoter methylation in prostate cancer by comparing it to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 154 human prostate tissue samples, including 92 cases with prostate cancer and 62 cases with BPH, were examined by methylation-specific PCR. Clinicopathological correlation between PAQR3 promoter methylation and prognostically relevant variables was studied by statistical analysis. Promoter methylation of PAQR3 was significantly more frequent in prostate carcinoma compared to BPH (73.9% vs. 25.8%, p < 0.01). The high prevalence of PAQR3 methylation in cancer foci was also confirmed with microdissection technique in 12 samples of prostate adenocarcinoma. PAQR3 hypermethylation was associated with perineural invasion (p = 0.03), an adverse clinicopathological feature of prostate cancer. We concluded that PAQR3 can be a promising methylation marker candidate for the detection and monitoring of prostate cancer."
"Leukocyte telomere length variation in different stages of schizophrenia  2017 Elsevier LtdRecent research has demonstrated that telomere maintenance might be a key integrating point for the cumulative effect of genetic and environmental factors in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Eighty-one participants with antipsychotic-naïve FEP, 173 with SCZ and 438 HC were enrolled in this study. Psychiatric diagnosis was assessed using the Semi-Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I (SCID-I). The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) were used to measure symptoms severity. Telomere length (TL) was determined using a multiplex qPCR assay. After adjustment for age, years of education, and smoking status, we found that patients with SCZ had longer TL (relative ratio (RR) = 1.08) than the HC group (RR = 1.00, Wald χ2 = 12.48, p = 0.002). Further, non-remitted SCZ patients presented longer TL (RR = 1.00) compared to remitted SCZ (RR = 0.88, Wald χ2 = 7.20, p = 0.007). TL in patients also correlated to psychopathology assessment in terms of total (p = 0.003) and positive PANSS scores (p = 0.001). No correlation with negative PANSS, YMRS, and CDSS or effects of medication was found on TL. Although the exact pathways underlying longer TL in SCZ patients remain unclear, these findings raise more questions than answers and suggest that TL may be of immense value on SCZ progression. Further studies are required to investigate the association of TL in FEP and SCZ."
"Synthesized amino-functionalized porous clay heterostructure as an effective thickener in waterborne polyurethane hybrid adhesives for lamination processes  2017 Elsevier LtdThe use of waterborne polyurethane (WPU) adhesives with non-volatile organic compounds (non-VOCs) has essentially expanded in laminating adhesive applications due to stringent environmental regulations, including on the release of VOCs. To function well, the inferior properties of WPUs should be overcome with good adhesion and cohesion mechanisms. High-performance WPU adhesive was synthesized by incorporating an amino-functionalized porous clay heterostructure (APCH) into the WPU to increase its internal strength via formation of urea linkages between fillers and the polymer matrix, to yield an organic/inorganic hybrid adhesive with greater cohesion. Urea linkages, as characterized by Fourier-self deconvolution of the C=O stretching vibration region (1600−1800 cm−1), increased with increasing APCH content. In addition, APCH significantly enhanced the adhesion properties of bonded joints together with an improved thermal stability of the adhesive, affirmed by the DSC analysis and higher viscosity observed by a Brookfield viscometer. The highest peel strength (126 N/m) was achieved with a WPU hybrid adhesive containing 2.0 wt% APCH, which can be used for application in untreated oriented polypropylene (OPP) lamination."
"WSSV-responsive gene expression under the influence of PmVRP15 suppression  2017 Elsevier LtdThe viral responsive protein 15 from black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (PmVRP15), is highly up-regulated and produced in the hemocytes of shrimp with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. To investigate the differential expression of genes from P. monodon hemocytes that are involved in WSSV infection under the influence of PmVRP15 expression, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) of PmVRP15-silenced shrimp infected with WSSV was performed. The 189 cDNA clones of the forward library were generated by subtracting the cDNAs from WSSV-infected and PmVRP15 knockdown shrimp with cDNAs from WSSV-infected and GFP knockdown shrimp. For the opposite subtraction, the 176 cDNA clones in the reverse library was an alternative set of genes in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes in the presence of PmVRP15 expression. The abundant genes in forward SSH library had a defense/homeostasis of 26%, energy/metabolism of 23% and in the reverse SSH library a hypothetical protein with unknown function was found (30%). The differential expressed immune-related genes from each library were selected for expression analysis using qRT-PCR. All selected genes from the forward library showed high up-regulation in the WSSV-challenged PmVRP15 knockdown group as expected. Interestingly, PmHHAP, a hemocyte homeostasis associated protein, and granulin-like protein, a conserved growth factor, are extremely up-regulated in the absence of PmVRP15 expression in WSSV-infected shrimp. Only transcript level of transglutaminase II, that functions in regulating hematopoietic tissue differentiation and inhibits mature hemocyte production in shrimp, was obviously down-regulated as observed from SSH results. Taken together, our results suggest that PmVRP15 might have a function relevant to hemocyte homeostasis during WSSV infection."
"Structural, elastic and anisotropic properties of CuZr from first-principles calculations  2017 Elsevier B.V.A systematic investigation on the structural, elastic and anisotropic properties of B19′ martensite CuZr is conducted using first principles calculations based on density-functional theory. Through geometry optimization, we observed an obvious structure change featuring a variation of the monoclinic angle β which shifts B19′ CuZr to a B33 type. In addition, the independent elastic constants of CuZr are determined by the stress-strain method, further enabling predictions of their Cauchy pressure, mechanical stability, anisotropic factor and Debye temperatures. Their anisotropic characters of linear compressibility, Young's modulus and shear modulus are analyzed in details by constructing three-dimensional models."
"Flowsheet-based model and exergy analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells for clean hydrogen production  2017 Elsevier LtdA solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) is an electrochemical technology used for hydrogen production via a steam electrolysis reaction. Because the existing SOEC models are complicated, the aim of this study is to develop a user-friendly SOEC model in a flowsheet simulator (Aspen Plus). The developed model is used to perform a parametric analysis to investigate the effects of key process parameters, i.e., operating temperature, current density, steam concentration, sweep gas type and number of cells, on the SOEC performance. The simulation results show that the voltage and the overall overpotential decrease as the cell temperature increases, whereas the opposite trends are observed when the current density increases. From the energy and exergy analyses, the total energy demand slightly increases with cell temperature, whereas the electrical energy demand decreases. Based on an operating temperature of 1273 K when the SOEC uses oxygen as the sweep gas, the highest energy and exergetic efficiencies of 78.45% and 92.20% are achieved at a current density of 2500 A m−2 and at a steam concentration of 90% in a 500-cell stack."
"Symptom prevalence, bother, and treatment satisfaction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms in Southeast Asia: a multinational, cross-sectional survey  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.Purpose: The overall objective of the survey was to systematically examine patients’ perspectives on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and their treatment in Southeast Asia. Methods: A multinational cross-sectional survey involving adult men seeking consultation at urology outpatient clinics because of LUTS in Southeast Asia was conducted using convenience sampling. Self-reported prevalence, bother, treatment and treatment satisfaction of selected LUTS including urgency, nocturia, slow stream, and post-micturition dribble were evaluated. Results: In total, 1535 eligible patients were enrolled in the survey. A majority of respondents were aged 56–75 years, not employed, and had not undergone prostate operation before. Overall, the self-reported prevalence of nocturia was 88% (95% CI 86–90%), slow stream 61% (95% CI 59–63%), post micturition dribble 55% (95% CI 52–58%), and urgency 52% (95% CI 49–55%). There were marked differences in the country specific prevalence of LUTS complaints. Frequently, symptoms coexisted and were combined with nocturia. More than half of patients felt at least some degree of bother from their symptoms: 61% for urgency, 57% for nocturia, 58% for slow stream, and 60% for post-micturition dribble. Before seeing the present urologists, nearly half of patients have received some form of prescribed treatment and more than 80% of patients indicated they would like to receive treatment. Conclusion: Men who sought urologist care for LUTS often presented with multiple symptoms. Nocturia emerged as the most common symptom amongst the four core symptoms studied."
"A Cone-beam Computed Tomographic Study of Root and Canal Morphology of Maxillary First and Second Permanent Molars in a Thai Population  2017 American Association of EndodontistsIntroduction Understanding tooth anatomy is crucial for effective endodontic treatment. This study investigated the roots and root canal morphology of maxillary first and second permanent molars in a Thai population using cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) imaging. Methods This study evaluated 476 maxillary first molars and 457 maxillary second molars receiving CBCT examination and determined the number of roots and canal morphology according to Vertucci's classification, and the prevalence of a second mesiobuccal (MB2) canal in the mesiobuccal (MB) root was correlated with sex, age, and tooth side. Results Three roots were most commonly found in maxillary first and second molars. MB2 canals in the MB root were found in 63.6% and 29.4% of first and second molars, respectively. The most common canal morphology in the first molar MB roots was type I (36.4%) followed by type II (28.8%), and type IV (25.3%). The most common canal morphology in the second molar MB roots was type I (70.6%) followed by type II (14.6%) and type IV (7.5%). Bilateral MB2 canals in the MB roots were present in 80.93% and 82.59% of the first and second molars, respectively. There was a significant correlation between males and the prevalence of MB2 canals in first molars (P <.05). Conclusions CBCT imaging is useful to determine root canal morphology. The prevalence of MB2 canals is approximately 60% and 30% in first and second molars, respectively. Furthermore, bilateral MB2 canals were commonly found. Our results can help endodontists to improve endodontic treatment outcomes."
"Food addiction: Prevalence, psychopathological correlates and associations with quality of life in a large sample  2017 Elsevier LtdObjective To determine the prevalence of food addiction in a large Brazilian non-clinical sample. Sociodemographic and psychopathological correlates of food addiction as well as associations with quality (QoL) domains were also investigated. Methods This cross-sectional study obtained data from a Brazilian anonymous web-based research platform (N = 7639; 71.3% females). Participants provided sociodemographic data and completed the modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0, PHQ-9, hypomania checklist (HCL-32), Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, AUDIT, modified Skin picking-Stanford questionnaire, Minnesota impulsive disorders interview, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised inventory (SCL-90R), early trauma inventory self report-short form, and the WHO Quality of Life instrument-Abbreviated version (WHOQOL-Bref). Associations were adjusted to potential confounders through multivariable models. Results The prevalence of food addiction was 4.32% (95%CI: 3.89–4.80%), and was more common among females. Food addiction was associated with a positive screen for a major depressive episode (OR = 4.41; 95%CI: 3.46–5.62), bipolar spectrum disorder (OR = 1.98; 95%CI: 1.43–2.75), and skin picking disorder (OR = 2.02; 95%CI: 1.31–3.09). Food addiction was also independently associated with exposure to early life psychological and sexual abuse (P = 0.008) as well as with reduced physical, psychological, social, and environment QoL (all P < 0.001). Conclusions Food addiction may be common in low and middle-income countries, though possibly less prevalent than in the US. Food addiction was associated with co-occurring mood disorders and skin picking disorder as well as with early life psychological and sexual abuse. Finally, food addiction was independently associated with broad reductions in QoL. Public health efforts towards the early recognition and management of food addiction are warranted."
"Kit W-sh Mutation Prevents Cancellous Bone Loss during Calcium Deprivation  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Calcium is essential for normal bone growth and development. Inadequate calcium intake increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Kit ligand/c-Kit signaling plays an important role in regulating bone homeostasis. Mice with c-Kit mutations are osteopenic. The present study aimed to investigate whether impairment of or reduction in c-Kit signaling affects bone turnover during calcium deprivation. Three-week-old male WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW-v/J (W/Wv) mice with c-Kit point mutation, KitW-sh/HNihrJaeBsmJ (Wsh/Wsh) mice with an inversion mutation in the regulatory elements upstream of the c-Kit promoter region, and their wild-type controls (WT) were fed either a normal (0.6% calcium) or a low calcium diet (0.02% calcium) for 3 weeks. μCT analysis indicated that both mutants fed normal calcium diet had significantly decreased cortical thickness and cancellous bone volume compared to WT. The low calcium diet resulted in a comparable reduction in cortical bone volume and cortical thickness in the W/Wv and Wsh/Wsh mice, and their corresponding controls. As expected, the low calcium diet induced cancellous bone loss in the W/Wv mice. In contrast, Wsh/Wsh cancellous bone did not respond to this diet. This c-Kit mutation prevented cancellous bone loss by antagonizing the low calcium diet-induced increase in osteoblast and osteoclast numbers in the Wsh/Wsh mice. Gene expression profiling showed that calcium deficiency increased Osx, Ocn, Alp, type I collagen, c-Fms, M-CSF, and RANKL/OPG mRNA expression in controls; however, the Wsh mutation suppressed these effects. Our findings indicate that although calcium restriction increased bone turnover, leading to osteopenia, the decreased c-Kit expression levels in the Wsh/Wsh mice prevented the low calcium diet-induced increase in cancellous bone turnover and bone loss but not the cortical bone loss."
"Different expression systems resulted in varied binding properties of anti-paclitaxel single-chain variable fragment antibody clone 1C2  2017, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK.The binding properties of recombinant antibody fragments, such as affinity and specificity, determine their usefulness for therapeutic and analytical applications. Anti-paclitaxel single-chain variable fragment clone 1C2 (anti-PT scFv1C2) was expressed using Escherichia coli cell and Bombyx mori larvae expression systems. The binding characteristics of the scFvs were evaluated using indirect competitive ELISA. The linear range of binding between anti-PT scFv1C2 and paclitaxel was significantly different between the anti-PT scFv1C2s derived from E. coli (1.056–5.700 μg/ml) and B. mori (7.813–1000 ng/ml), which indicated that different expression systems resulted in different sensitivities for paclitaxel determination. In addition, the binding specificity of anti-PT scFv1C2 varied between expression systems. This finding implied that the expression system significantly affects the binding properties of recombinant antibodies, especially antibodies against low-molecular-weight targets."
"Mesostructured natural rubber/in situ formed silica nanocomposites: A simple way to prepare mesoporous silica with hydrophobic properties  2017 Elsevier Inc.We report here a simple way to prepare mesoporous silica materials with hydrophobic properties, as natural rubber (NR)/hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) nanocomposites, via an in situ sol-gel process using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and decylamine as a silica precursor and organic template, respectively. Effects of swelling the NR sheet in TEOS, prior to dissolution in tetrahydrofuran, on the mesostructure, chemical composition and hydrophobicity of the resulting nanocomposites were investigated. The NR/HMS prepared with the pre-swelling step had superior structural and textural properties to that prepared without the pre-swelling step. The presence of rubber phase entrapped in the mesostructured silica and genuinely mesostructured NR/silica nanocomposite framework was confirmed by osmium tetroxide staining coupled with transmission electron microscopy analysis. The results obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated a good dispersion of NR molecules in the mesostructured nanocomposites, which was determined by the distribution of non-hydrolyzed ethoxy groups. The use of toluene extraction, followed by characterization of the resulting material, identified the weak nature of the NR-silica interaction. Dynamic light scattering indicated that the presence of TEOS in the pre-swollen NR matrix enhanced the diffusion of template molecules into the rubber phase, and the dispersion of NR molecules in the synthesis mixture. Finally, a plausible mechanism for the formation of NR/HMS nanocomposites via cooperative templating route, in which the remnant ethoxy groups acted as hydrophobic linkers between the rubber chains and the silica oligomers, was proposed."
"Temporal and spatial distributions of precursory seismicity rate changes in the Thailand-Laos-Myanmar border region: implication for upcoming hazardous earthquakes  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.To study the prospective areas of upcoming strong-to-major earthquakes, i.e., Mw ≥ 6.0, a catalog of seismicity in the vicinity of the Thailand-Laos-Myanmar border region was generated and then investigated statistically. Based on the successful investigations of previous works, the seismicity rate change (Z value) technique was applied in this study. According to the completeness earthquake dataset, eight available case studies of strong-to-major earthquakes were investigated retrospectively. After iterative tests of the characteristic parameters concerning the number of earthquakes (N) and time window (Tw), the values of 50 and 1.2 years, respectively, were found to reveal an anomalous high Z-value peak (seismic quiescence) prior to the occurrence of six out of the eight major earthquake events studied. In addition, the location of the Z-value anomalies conformed fairly well to the epicenters of those earthquakes. Based on the investigation of correlation coefficient and the stochastic test of the Z values, the parameters used here (N = 50 events and Tw = 1.2 years) were suitable to determine the precursory Z value and not random phenomena. The Z values of this study and the frequency-magnitude distribution b values of a previous work both highlighted the same prospective areas that might generate an upcoming major earthquake: (i) some areas in the northern part of Laos and (ii) the eastern part of Myanmar."
"Wine futures: Pricing and allocation as levers against quality uncertainty  2018, Springer International Publishing AG.This study examines the impact of using wine futures in order to mitigate the winemaker’s risk stemming from quality uncertainty. In each vintage, a winemaker harvests grapes and crushes them in order to make wine. A premium wine sits in barrels for 18–24 months. During the aging process, tasting experts take samples and establish a barrel score; this barrel score often indicates the expert’s perception of whether the wine will be a superior wine. Based on the barrel score, the winemaker can sell some or all of her/his wine in the form of wine futures and in advance of bottling. The winemaker makes three decisions: (1) the price to sell her/his wine futures, (2) the quantity of wine futures to be sold in advance, and (3) the amount of wine to be kept for retail and distribution. The wine continues to age for one more year after barrel samples. The tasting experts then provide a bottle score upon the bottling of the wine. At the time the winemaker determines the price and quantity of wine futures, this unrealized bottle score represents the uncertainty that influences the market price of the wine. This study makes two contributions to the optimization of pricing and quantity decisions and offers insightful recommendations for practicing managers. First, it develops a stochastic optimization model that integrates uncertain consumer valuations of wine both in the form of futures and in bottle, and the uncertainty associated with bottle scores. Second, it provides an empirical analysis using data collected from Bordeaux wineries engaging in wine futures. The empirical analysis demonstrates that wine futures can be used as price and quantity levers to mitigate the negative consequences of quality uncertainty. The results provide clues as to how other markets (e.g. Italy and the U.S.) can establish similar wine futures markets in order to help their small and artisanal winemakers."
"A one-pot, solid-state route for realizing highly visible light active Na-doped gC3N4 photocatalysts  2017 Elsevier Inc.The visible light photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride (gC3N4), a promising metal-free photocatalytic material, is rather low, and is not as good as expected. Herein, to realize improved photocatalytic activity, sodium-doped gC3N4 (Na-gC3N4) is prepared through a novel solid-state process based on the thermal polycondensation of urea in the presence of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride. The proposed solid-state process is simple, requires no solvent, and provides a general route for rapid and large-scale synthesis of metal-doped gC3N4. The Na species exist in + 1 oxidation state and bind N atoms in the nitride ring of gC3N4. The photocatalytic activity improvement of gC3N4 for the mineralization of 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) under visible light is seen after the Na doping. The improved photocatalytic activity is due to increased absorption of light, increased separation of charge carriers, stronger oxidation ability of valance band holes, and increased specific surface area. The typical photocatalytic activity of 0.6 wt% Na-gC3N4 for the EE2 mineralization with an initial EE2 concentration of 1 mg/L and a catalyst concentration of 1 g/L is 95.7% within 2 h of visible light irradiation. Under identical experimental conditions, the EE2 mineralization by pristine gC3N4 is only 23.5%."
"Curcuminoids in Multi-Component Synthesis  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The introduction of a 1,3-dicarbonyl unit in curcuminoid derivatives for multi-component reactions (MCRs) to furnish six-membered heterocyclic compounds has been reviewed. Attention has focused on the assembly of the three-component Biginelli reactions relating to curcumin or tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), aromatic aldehydes and urea as substrates. The hybrid molecules of two bioactive agents were designed and synthesized by using these MCRs concepts. The four-component modified Hantzsch condensation was the latest development of this synthetic route. The possible mechanism of the MCRs of both curcumin and THC were also summarized."
"Hybrid inorganic-organic complexes: Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, single crystal X-ray structure determination and antimicrobial activities of three copper(II)-diethylenetriamine-p-nitrobenzoate complexes  2017 Elsevier B.V.Three new hybrid inorganic-organic complexes: [Cu(dien)(pnb)2]·H2O, 1; [Cu(dien)2](pnb)2, 2; and [Cu(dien)(pnb)(H2O)](pnb)(Hpnb), 3 (where pnb = p-nitrobenzoate, dien = diethylenetriamine, tridenate N-donor ligand), have been synthesized at room temperature and characterized by spectroscopic (FT-IR, UV–Vis, EPR) methods. The structures of all newly synthesized complexes 1–3 have been unambiguously established by single crystal X-ray structure determination. All the complexes 1–3 showed variation in the coordination environment around copper(II) metal center obtained under slightly different reaction conditions by using same reactants but different synthetic routes at room temperature. Crystal lattices of coordination complexes 1–3 are stabilized by various non-covalent interactions such as N-H…O, C-H…O, O-H…O etc. All the three copper(II) complexes 1–3 show significant antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria."
"Factors influencing piglet pre-weaning mortality in 47 commercial swine herds in Thailand  2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.The present study aims to determine the occurrence of piglet pre-weaning mortality in commercial swine herds in Thailand in relation to piglet, sow, and environmental factors. Data were collected from the database of the computerized recording system from 47 commercial swine herds in Thailand. The raw data were carefully scrutinized for accuracy. Litters with a lactation length < 16 days or >28 days were excluded. In total, 199,918 litters from 74,088 sows were included in the analyses. Piglet pre-weaning mortality at the individual sow level was calculated as piglet pre-weaning mortality (%) = (number of littermate pigs − number of piglets at weaning) / number of littermate pigs. Litters were classified according to sow parity numbers (1, 2–5, and 6–9), average birth weight of the piglets (0.80–1.29, 1.30–1.79, 1.80–2.50 kg), number of littermate pigs (5–7, 8–10, 11–12, and 13–15 piglets), and size of the herd (small, medium, and large). Pearson correlations were conducted to analyze the associations between piglet pre-weaning mortality and reproductive parameters. Additionally, a general linear model procedure was performed to analyze the various factors influencing piglet pre-weaning mortality. On average, piglet pre-weaning mortality was 11.2% (median = 9.1%) and varied among herds from 4.8 to 19.2%. Among all the litters, 62.1, 18.1, and 19.8% of the litters had a piglet pre-weaning mortality rate of 0–10, 11–20, and greater than 20%, respectively. As the number of littermate pigs increased, piglet pre-weaning mortality also increased (r = 0.390, P < 0.001). Litters with 13–16 littermate pigs had a higher piglet pre-weaning mortality than litters with 5–7, 8–10, and 11–12 littermate pigs (20.8, 7.8, 7.2, and 11.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). Piglet pre-weaning mortality in large-sized herds was higher than that in small- and medium-sized herds (13.6, 10.6, and 11.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). Interestingly, in all categories of herd size, piglet pre-weaning mortality was increased almost two times when the number of littermates increased from 11–12 to 13–16 piglets. Furthermore, piglets with birth weights of 0.80–1.29 kg in large-sized herds had a higher risk of mortality than those in small- and medium-sized herds (15.3, 10.9, and 12.2%, respectively, P < 0.001). In conclusion, in commercial swine herds in the tropics, piglet pre-weaning mortality averaged 11.2% and varied among herds from 4.8 to 19.2%. The litters with 13–16 littermate pigs had piglet pre-weaning mortality of up to 20.8%. Piglets with low birth weight (0.80–1.29 kg) had a higher risk of pre-weaning mortality. Management strategies for reducing piglet pre-weaning mortality in tropical climates should be emphasized in litters with a high number of littermate pigs, low piglet birth weights, and large herd sizes."
"Variability of particle configurations achievable by 2-nozzle flame syntheses of the Au-Pd-TiO2 system and their catalytic behaviors in the selective hydrogenation of acetylene  2017 Elsevier B.V.Catalysts with Au and Pd supported on TiO2 (Au:Pd 1:1 wt/wt%) were prepared by 1- and 2-nozzle flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). The 2-nozzle configuration allowed to synthesize various particle configurations by separate or co-feeding of the metal precursor solutions to the two nozzles. For the Au-Pd/TiO2 system, four different catalyst particle configurations were investigated: “TiO2 + AuPd”, “Pd/TiO2 +Au”, “Au/TiO2 +Pd”, and “Pd/TiO2 + Au/TiO2”, where + separates the corresponding precursor solutions fed to the two nozzles. There were no significant differences in the specific surface areas and the average TiO2 crystallite sizes of the catalysts (100 m2/g and 16–17 nm, respectively) with the exception of “Pd/TiO2 +Au/TiO2”, which exhibited larger surface area and smaller crystallite size (152 m2/g, 12 nm) due to halving of the Ti precursor concentration in each nozzle. As revealed by CO chemisorption, XPS, and STEM-EDX results, the catalyst properties varied largely in terms of bimetallic AuPd particle compositions, the interaction between metal–metal and metal-support, and the location of Pd (or AuPd) on the TiO2. Among the catalysts studied, “TiO2 + AuPd” prepared with the 2-nozzle system exhibited the highest conversion of acetylene (∼50%) at 40 °C with high selectivity to ethylene ( > 95%). Co-feeding the noble metal precursors together with the Ti precursor afforded less active catalysts due to the formation of Ti-O species partially covering the most active bimetallic AuPd particles. Compared to the commercially available acetylene hydrogenation catalyst and the AuPd/TiO2 prepared by conventional co-impregnation and deposition-precipitation, all the FSP-AuPd/TiO2 catalysts showed superior performances under the reaction conditions used."
"Chemical state and local structure of V species incorporated in δ-Bi2O3 photocatalysts  2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.Herein, the delta phase bismuth oxide (δ-Bi2O3) with high crystallinity can be obtained at room temperature through a sol–gel route in the presence of VO3 −. The as-synthesized δ-Bi2O3 photocatalysts are characterized using synchrotron-based techniques, including ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Results show that V species plays a key role in stabilizing the δ phase of Bi2O3. With increasing V/Bi molar ratio, crystallinity, light absorption ability, and specific surface area increase. The V species predominantly exists in the +5 oxidation state, irrespective of V loading amount, and is tetrahedrally coordinated to four O atoms with a bond length of 1.716 Å. The δ-Bi2O3 photocatalysts show appreciable visible light activity for the decomposition of atenolol, an important β-blocker drug."
"Oxidative stress in urothelial carcinogenesis: Measurements of protein carbonylation and intracellular production of reactive oxygen species  Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2018.Oxidative stress contributes substantially to urothelial carcinogenesis. Its extent can be assessed by measurements of reactive species (mainly reactive oxygen species (ROS)), oxidatively modified damage products, and levels of various antioxidants. We presented herein the methods for the measurement of protein carbonyl content and intracellular production of ROS. Protein carbonyl is the most commonly used indicator of protein oxidation because it is early formed and relatively stable under oxidative stress. Determination of protein carbonyl relies on the derivatization of carbonyl groups (aldehydes: R-CHO and ketones: R-CO-R) with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) under strongly acidic conditions to yield stable dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazones. Absorbance of the DNP hydrazones at 370–375 nm is proportional to the content of carbonyl groups. To report the protein carbonyl content, it is usually normalized by total proteins. Detection of intracellular ROS production is based on oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) by ROS to produce the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Fluorescent intensity measured at 480 nm excitation and 535 nm emission is directly proportional to the amount of ROS generated."
"Enhancement of arsenite removal using manganese oxide coupled with iron (III) trimesic  2017A simultaneous removal of As(III) was investigated on a mixture of manganese oxide based octahedral molecular sieves (K-OMS2) and iron-benzenetricarboxylate (Fe-BTC). As(III) removal was stimulated by an oxidation cooperated with adsorption process. K-OMS2 and Fe-BTC were separately synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). K-OMS2 showed characters of pure cryptomelane phase, nanorod structure, and a mixed-valent manganese framework with the coexistence of Mn(IV) and Mn(III). As(III) was successfully oxidized to As(V) by K-OMS2 in a temperature range of 303–333 K. An intermediate adsorption of As(V) was carried out with Fe-BTC in the same batch. A maximum adsorption capacity, described by Langmuir isotherm model, was observed at 76.34 mg/g. With an As(III) initial concentration of 5 mg/L, when K-OMS2 and Fe-BTC were simultaneously introduced into the solution, the As(III) removal process was completed within 60 min. Thus, it shortened the process time compared to the case where K-OMS2 was added first, followed by the addition of Fe-BTC."
"Multi-objective optimization on laser solder jet bonding process in head gimbal assembly using the response surface methodology  2017 Elsevier LtdThis paper aims to investigate the effect of laser solder jet bonding parameters to the solder joints in Head Gimbal Assembly. Laser solder jet bonding utilizes the fiber laser to melt solder ball in capillary. The molten solder is transferred to two bonding pads by nitrogen gas. The response surface methodology have been used to investigate the effects of laser energy, wait time, nitrogen gas pressure, and focal position on the shear strength of solder joints and the change of pitch static attitude (PSA). The response surface methodology is employed to establish the reliable mathematical relationships between the laser soldering parameters and desired responses. Then, multi-objective optimization is conducted to determine the optimal process parameters that can enhance the joint shear strength and minimize the change of PSA. The validation test confirms that the predicted value has good agreement with the actual value."
"Dietary cation and anion difference: Effects on milk production and body fluid distribution in lactating dairy goats under tropical conditions  2017 Japanese Society of Animal Science.This study aimed to determine the effect of dietary cation and anion difference (DCAD) on milk production and body fluid distribution in lactating dairy goats. Ten dairy goats were selected and divided into two groups, five animals each. Animals received either control DCAD (control, 22.81 mEq/100 g dry matter (DM)) or high DCAD (DCAD, 39.08 mEq/100 g DM). The results indicated that rectal temperature (Tr), respiration rate, milk yield and compositions did not differ between groups. But the percentage change of Tr from the DCAD group was lower than the control group between 09.00 and 13.00 hours. DM intake tended to increase in the DCAD group. Dairy goats in the DCAD group drank more water, but urinary excretion and plasma antidiuretic hormone concentration remained unchanged. Apparent water balance was higher from the DCAD group over 24 h. There was no effect of DCAD on plasma and blood volumes, but tended to increase in extracellular fluid and thereby increased total body water. The present results indicate that animals supplemented with high DCAD increase their total body water and apparent water balance. These results have contributed to the process of adaptation for evaporative cooling and would be useful in slowing down the elevation in Tr."
"Bacterial community composition and distribution in different segments of the gastrointestinal tract of wild-caught adult Penaeus monodon  2017 John Wiley & Sons LtdBacterial community associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of aquaculture animals can play important roles in health, nutrition and disease. Compared with the GI tract of aquatic vertebrates such as fish, crustacean GI tract has unique structures and surfaces in different segments that may contribute to differences in the bacterial communities. This study examined the bacterial composition and distribution in different segments along the GI tract and in digesta of wild-caught adult Penaeus monodon using Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), real-time quantitative PCR and clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes. Thirty-nine bacterial species in four phyla including Proteobacteria (α, β, ε, γ), Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were represented in the GI tract of adult P. monodon. Proteobacteria comprised over 80% abundance of the bacterial community in most segments of the GI tract, except the middle intestine that was dominated by Firmicutes (~50% abundance). The results also showed that bacterial communities showed significant differences along the GI tract segments, particularly the hindgut (p <.001) with Vibrio and Ferrimonas as dominant genera. The knowledge about the distribution of bacteria could be useful in understanding interaction of commensal bacteria and pathogens in different segments, and its potential influence on the effectiveness of probiotic bacteria in the GI tract of shrimp."
"Apoptosis induced by Moringa oleifera Lam. pod in mouse colon carcinoma model  2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of boiled Moringa oleifera Lam. pod (bMO) in colon carcinogenesis via apoptotic pathway. Four groups of mice (eight mice/group) were induced by azoxymethane (AOM, 10 mg/kg BW i.p. at the third week) followed by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days (2% in drinking water at the fourth week), while one negative group (n = 8) received AIN-76A basal diet without AOM/DSS induction. Positive control group received basal diet with AOM/DSS induction, whereas treatment groups received basal diet containing 1.5%, 3.0%, and 6.0% of bMO at the 5th week till 20th week after AOM/DSS inductions. Mice were sacrificed and necropsied at the end of the 20th week. The results showed tumor incidence 87.5% and multiplicity 9.5 in positive control group. Subsequently, mice that received 1.5%–6.0% bMO exhibited tumor incidences and multiplicities at 25%–75% and 1.8–8.3, respectively. Pro-apoptosis protein BAX investigated by immunohistochemistry in mice treated with 3.0% bMO was significantly higher than positive control. Anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2 showed the lowest expression in mice fed with 6.0% bMO. The BAX/BCL-2 ratio proteins and the nuclear staining were found at the highest rate in mice received 3.0% bMO. This finding suggested that the bMO exhibited potent apoptosis induction through dissimilarity of BCL-2 family protein expression, thereby decreased BCL-2 protein expression and increased the BAX protein to promote cell death. Therefore, bMO has a potential as chemotherapeutic agent in colon cancer through induction of apoptosis."
"Synergistic degradation of pyrene by five culturable bacteria in a mangrove sediment-derived bacterial consortium  2017 Elsevier B.V.A pyrene-degrading microbial consortium was obtained after enrichment with mangrove sediment collected from Thailand. Five cultivable bacteria (Mycobacterium spp. PO1 and PO2, Novosphingobium pentaromativorans PY1, Ochrobactrum sp. PW1, and Bacillus sp. FW1) were successfully isolated from the consortium. Draft genomes of them showed that two different morphotypes of Mycobacterium (PO1 and PO2), possessed a complete gene set for pyrene degradation. PY1 contained genes for phthalate assimilation via protocatechuate, a central intermediate, by meta-cleavage pathway, and PW1 possessed genes for protocatechuate degradation via ortho-cleavage pathway. The occurrence of biosurfactant-producing genes in FW1 suggests the involvement in enhancing the pyrene bioavailability. Biotransformation experiments revealed that Mycobacterium completely degraded 100 mg L−1 pyrene within six days, whereas no significant degradation was observed with the others. Notably, PY1 and PW1 exhibited higher activity for protocatechuate degradation than the others. The artificially reconstructed consortia containing Mycobacterium with the other three strains (PY1, PW1 and FW1) showed three-fold higher degradation rate for pyrene than the individual Mycobacterium. The enhanced pyrene biodegradation achieved in the consortium was due to the cooperative interaction of bacterial mixture. Our findings showing that synergistic degradation of pyrene in the consortium will facilitate the application of the defined bacterial consortium in bioremediation."
"The role of hypernitrosylation in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of neuroprogressive diseases  2017 Elsevier LtdThere is a wealth of data indicating that de novo protein S-nitrosylation in general and protein transnitrosylation in particular mediates the bulk of nitric oxide signalling. These processes enable redox sensing and facilitate homeostatic regulation of redox dependent protein signalling, function, stability and trafficking. Increased S-nitrosylation in an environment of increasing oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) is initially a protective mechanism aimed at maintaining protein structure and function. When O&NS becomes severe, mechanisms governing denitrosylation and transnitrosylation break down leading to the pathological state referred to as hypernitrosylation (HN). Such a state has been implicated in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and we investigate its potential role in the development and maintenance of neuroprogressive disorders. In this paper, we propose a model whereby the hypernitrosylation of a range of functional proteins and enzymes lead to changes in activity which conspire to produce at least some of the core abnormalities contributing to the development and maintenance of pathology in these illnesses."
"Theoretical and heuristic aspects of heterogeneous system scheduling with constraints on client's multiple I/O ports  2017 Elsevier B.V.An effective scheduling algorithm for distributed computing systems is essential for assigning client's tasks to run on a set of processors at a minimum makespan. Existing algorithms permit the client tasks to be sent and received simultaneously to the processors without any possibility of collisions. This implies an unrealistic situation that there is an unlimited number of I/O ports which in fact is physically limited by the underlying architecture and technology. This paper takes this crucial constraint of I/O ports that no existing algorithm has addressed as a part of client task scheduling. Task to be scheduled are represented by a directed acyclic graph with arbitrary dependency structures and arranged by their critical paths. Two theoretical scheduling patterns under multiple I/O ports to achieve the optimal makespan with minimum latent delay are discovered and proved, namely, triangular and parallelogram patterns. They are used as the principal basis for the proposed scheduling algorithm. The focus is on collision avoidance of these tasks to be sent or received through the multiple I/O ports. Plots of task graph on performance comparison with other algorithms from the experiment show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of shorter makespan, less delay, and less number of ports used. In the real application data set, the makespan performance obtained by the proposed algorithm is better than other algorithms by 62.05%."
"Cytotoxic Flavones from the Stem Bark of Bougainvillea spectabilis Willd  Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.Five new flavones possessing a fully substituted A-ring with C-6 and C-8 methyl groups, bougainvinones I - M (1 - 5), along with three known congeners, 2′-hydroxydemethoxymatteucinol (6), 5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxy-3-methoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone (7) and 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone (8), were isolated from the EtOAc extract of the stem bark of Bougainvillea spectabilis. Their structures were established by means of spectroscopic data (ultraviolet, infrared, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and one-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance) and single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis. The in vitro cytotoxicity of all isolated compounds against five cancer cell lines (KB, HeLa S-3, MCF-7, HT-29, and HepG2) was evaluated. Compound 5 showed promising cytotoxic activity against the KB and HeLa S-3 cell lines, with IC 50 values of 7.44 and 6.68 μM. The other compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against the KB cell line."
"I'll get there because I'm great, or am I? Narcissistic vulnerability moderates the narcissistic grandiosity – goal persistence relationship  2017 Elsevier LtdAcross three studies, we examined the moderating effect of narcissistic vulnerability on the relationship between narcissistic grandiosity and persistence. In Study 1 (n = 338), narcissistic grandiosity predicted greater goal-drive persistence, but only when individuals also possessed a degree of narcissistic vulnerability. In Study 2 (n = 199), we replicated these effects and demonstrated that they were independent of socially desirable responding. In Study 3 (n = 372), narcissistic vulnerability moderated the grandiosity – persistence relationship to predict persistence for personally relevant goals and hypothetical goals. Notably, the moderating effect of vulnerability was independent of the effects of self-esteem. These results provide the first evidence that narcissistic grandiosity predicts persistence only in the presence of self-doubt regarding superiority. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the interplay between the two components of narcissism."
"Hyperspectral imaging for rapid evaluation and visualization of quality deterioration index of vacuum packaged dry-cured sausages  2017 Elsevier B.V.A rapid and nondestructive method to evaluate and visualize quality of vacuum packaged dry-cured sausages was developed using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) spectroscopy. Changes in physicochemical, microbiological and sensory attributes of the packaged dry-cured sausages were monitored during storage at 20 °C. Discriminant factor analysis (DFA) could classify samples into different groups as a function of storage time. The quality deterioration index (QDI) of the packaged dry-cured sausages was signified and assigned to the individual DFA classified groups. HSI spectroscopy was used to collect both spectral data in the wavelength range of 380–1000 nm and spatial data of 68 × 68 pixels. Partial least squares (PLS) regression model was constructed to establish the relationship between the HSI hypercube data and the QDI. Distribution maps of the QDI were then constructed to visualize the quality attributes of the sausages. The color distribution map of the QDI enabled the identification of different qualities of the vacuum packaged sausages as a function of storage time. The results demonstrated that the HSI coupled with chemometric and image processing techniques can be used as a rapid and nondestructive method to evaluate quality of the sausages."
"Analytic properties of tracy-singh products for operator matrices  2018 by Eudoxus Press, LLC. All rights reserved.We show that the Tracy-Singh product of Hilbert space operators is continuous with respect to the operator-norm topology. The Tracy-Singh product of two nonzero operators is compact if and only if both factors are compact. We provide upper and lower bounds for certain Schatten p-norms of the Tracy-Singh product of operators. It turns out that this product is continuous with respect to the topologies on norm ideals of compact operators, trace class operators, and Hilbert-Schmidt class operators. Thus the Tracy-Singh product preserves such classes of operators."

"A survey of epilepsy knowledge, attitudes and practice in school-aged children in Bangkok, Thailand  2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjectives: To estimate the level of knowledge about epilepsy, attitude towards PWE and practice in school-aged children in Bangkok, Thailand. Significant findings from this study will be employed to develop a relevant and effective tool to educate children. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand, from August 2014 to December 2015. Study population included school-aged children between 9 and 14 years (4th to 8th grade). A structured age-appropriate, Thai culture-adjusted and simple 20-item questionnaire was used for this survey. The questionnaire comprised three domains which were eight items for knowledge (K), seven items for attitudes (A), and five items for practice (P). Descriptive and analytic statistics including Pearson's correlation were used to find correlation among KAP domains and age with KAP scores. Results: A total of 1040 students from 13 schools participated in our survey study. Mean age was 11.27 (SD 0.94). Some basic knowledge about epilepsy and practice of inserting objects into mouth of seizing persons account for a high magnitude of misunderstanding. Girls and older-aged children are associated with better positive attitudes towards epilepsy. It seems that educating children with knowledge of both epilepsy and first aid is necessary to improve positive attitudes among this age group. Conclusions: Given the findings, our study suggests that a lack of knowledge in some aspects of KAP in children exists. Educational materials should contain basic knowledge about the simple pathogenesis of seizure, seizure types and seizure characteristics, and provide explanation as to why inserting objects into mouths of seizing persons is not recommended."
"Heuristic-based usability evaluation tool for android applications  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.Heuristic evaluation is a popular method for evaluating usability of user interface due to its simplicity and cost efficiency compared to other methods. Evaluation is done by evaluators by inspecting user interface on each screen of an application against usability design principles or heuristics. The evaluation depends on judgment and experience of the evaluators whether they can spot the problems, and there are many heuristics to check against. This paper attempts to assist the evaluators by automating the evaluation task against a number of design heuristics. The paper presents a development of a usability evaluation tool for Android applications by inspecting source code and reporting locations in the code where violations of heuristics are found. Although only small part of the heuristics can be checked automatically, an experiment shows that the tool can help save evaluation time and can discover usability problems that are missed by evaluators."
"Risk assessment of security requirements of banking information systems based on attack patterns  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.Security risk assessment is an important process for the implementation of any information systems including those in the banking sector. When a bank initiates or implements an information system project, requirements engineers or business analysts in the project conduct an initial validation of system security requirements to check if they comply with banking security regulations before an audit takes place. This paper presents an initial risk assessment method to assist the project team in validating security requirements of a banking information system. Text similarity analysis is used to identify which security regulations are missing from the security requirements of the bank, and a quantitative risk index model is also proposed to determine the level of risk associated with the regulations missing from the requirements. The risk level is based on the harm any potential attacks can do to the information system if the missing regulations are not implemented. Using a case study of banking in Thailand, we apply the method to assess security requirements of Thai commercial banks against the IT Best Practices of the Bank of Thailand. We evaluate the performance of security compliance checking in terms of F-measure and accuracy, and validity of risk assessment in terms of correlation with security expert judgment."
"Rome foundation-asian working team report: Asian functional gastrointestinal disorder symptom clusters  Article author(s).Objective Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are diagnosed by the presence of a characteristic set of symptoms. However, the current criteria-based diagnostic approach is to some extent subjective and largely derived from observations in English-speaking Western patients. We aimed to identify latent symptom clusters in Asian patients with FGID. Design 1805 consecutive unselected patients with FGID who presented for primary or secondary care to 11 centres across Asia completed a cultural and linguistic adaptation of the Rome III Diagnostic Questionnaire that was translated to the local languages. Principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to identify symptom clusters. Results N ine symptom clusters were identified, consisting of two oesophageal factors (F6: globus, odynophagia and dysphagia; F9: chest pain and heartburn), two gastroduodenal factors (F5: bloating, fullness, belching and flatulence; F8 regurgitation, nausea and vomiting), three bowel factors (F2: abdominal pain and diarrhoea; F3: meal-related bowel symptoms; F7: upper abdominal pain and constipation) and two anorectal factors (F1: anorectal pain and constipation; F4: diarrhoea, urgency and incontinence). Conclusion We found that the broad categorisation used both in clinical practice and in the Rome system, that is, broad anatomical divisions, and certain diagnoses with long historical records, that is, IBS with diarrhoea, and chronic constipation, are still valid in our Asian societies. In addition, we found a bowel symptom cluster with meal trigger and a gas cluster that suggests a different emphasis in our populations. Future studies to compare a non-Asian cohort and to match to putative pathophysiology will help to verify our findings."
"Prevalence of Persistent Renal Dysfunction in Perinatally HIV-infected Thai Adolescents  2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Background: Persistent renal dysfunction (PRD) has been reported in up to 22% of perinatally HIV-infected adolescents (PHAs) in the United States and Europe. There are limited data available on PRD among PHAs in resource-limited settings regarding access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) at more advanced HIV stages. Methods: We retrospectively described the prevalence of PRD and associated factors in a Thai PHA cohort. Inclusion criteria were current age ≥10 years old and at least 2 serum creatinine (Cr) measurements after ART initiation. Cr and urine examination were performed every 6-12 months. PRD was defined as having ≥2 measurements of low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); either <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or elevated Cr for age and eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2, or proteinuria (dipstick proteinuria ≥1+). Factors associated with PRD were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: This study included 255 PHAs with median (interquartile range) age of 16.7 (14.5-18.8) and ART duration of 10.3 (7.1-12.4) years. Fifty-six percentage used boosted protease inhibitor (bPI)-based regimens, and 63% used tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The overall PRD prevalence was 14.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.1-19.0]; low eGFR 6.7%, proteinuria 3.5% and both 3.9%. Among 109 users of TDF with bPI, 22.9% had PRD and 2.8% discontinued/adjusted dosing of TDF because of nephrotoxicity. Factors associated with PRD were age 10-15 years old (adjusted odd ratio (aOR): 10.1, 95% CI: 4.1-25.2), male (aOR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4-7.7), CD4 nadir <150 cells/mm3 (aOR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.1-6.1) and use of TDF with bPI (aOR: 9.6, 95% CI: 3.2-28.9). Conclusions: PRD is common among PHAs. Almost one-fifth of adolescents using TDF with bPI had PRD. These adolescents should be a priority group for renal monitoring."
"Week 96 results of the randomized, multicentre Maraviroc Switch (MARCH) study  2017 British HIV AssociationObjectives: The Maraviroc Switch (MARCH) study week 48 data demonstrated that maraviroc, a chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5) inhibitor, was a safe and effective switch for the ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) component of a two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor [N(t)RTI] plus PI/r-based antiretroviral regimen in patients with R5-tropic virus. Here we report the durability of this finding. Methods: MARCH, an international, multicentre, randomized, 96-week open-label switch study, enrolled HIV-1-infected adults with R5-tropic virus who were stable (> 24 weeks) and virologically suppressed [plasma viral load (pVL) < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL]. Participants were randomized to continue their current PI/r-based regimen (PI/r) or to switch to MVC plus two N(t)RTIs (MVC) (1:2 randomization). The primary endpoint was the difference in the proportion with pVL < 200 copies/mL at 96 weeks. The switch arm was defined as noninferior if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference was < −12% in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety endpoints (the difference in the mean change from baseline or a comparison of proportions) were analysed as key secondary endpoints. Results: Eighty-two (PI/r) and 156 (MVC) participants were randomized and included in the ITT analysis; 71 (87%) and 130 (83%) were in follow-up and on therapy at week 96. At week 96, 89.0% and 90.4% in the PI/r and MVC arms, respectively, had pVL < 50 copies/mL (95% CI -6.6, 10.2). Moreover, in those switching away from PI/r, there were significant reductions in mean total cholesterol (differences 0.31 mmol/L; P = 0.02) and triglycerides (difference 0.44 mmol/L; P < 0.001). Changes in CD4 T-cell count, renal function, and serious and nonserious adverse events were similar in the two arms. Conclusions: MVC as a switch for a PI/r is safe and effective at maintaining virological suppression while having significant lipid benefits over 96 weeks."
"Usability evaluation on learning management system  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.The learning management system (LMS) is an information and communication technology (ICT) that helps to improve efficiency of learning activities especially on higher education. Moreover, it becomes necessary for the transformation of education through digital format and virtual learning environments. The well-designed LMS interface will enrich the effectiveness of pedagogy. The myCourseVille is a LMS that use in many universities in Thailand to support teachers and students to manage their class activities. However, the problems of improper interface and complexness of using myCourseVille were also reported from end-users. While, the successful of LMS adoption and user satisfaction depend on the ease of use and user friendly interface of the system. In order to improve quality of myCourseVille and enhance user satisfaction, the details and root cause of interface problems were tested and identified. Thus, the purpose of present study was to identify the major concerned interface issues of myCourseVille by using usability evaluation method associated with five usability attributes on student’s interface and teacher’s interface. The implication of this study could be used as a guideline for LMS software developer to improve the basic features of the system and quality of user interface in term of usability."
"Comparison of UML sequence diagrams to trace technical specification change  Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.Sequence diagrams are widely used to model the interactions between objects in an information system. This paper presents a method and develops a tool for comparing UML sequence diagrams to facilitate tracing the technical specification change. The change log is generated to report all the affected elements. The traceability graph associated with the new version of sequence diagram is also constructed to illustrate the updated dependency among components. The proposed automation approach would benefit software process improvement for change impact analysis. In addition, the output generated from the implemented system could fasten the tedious documentation chore."
"An enhanced deep convolutional encoder-decoder network for road segmentation on aerial imagery  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.Object classification from images is among the many practical examples where deep learning algorithms have successfully been applied. In this paper, we present an improved deep convolutional encoder-decoder network (DCED) for segmenting road objects from aerial images. Several aspects of the proposed method are enhanced, incl. incorporation of ELU (exponential linear unit)—as opposed to ReLU (rectified linear unit) that typically outperforms ELU in most object classification cases; amplification of datasets by adding incrementally-rotated images with eight different angles in the training corpus (this eliminates the limitation that the number of training aerial images is usually limited), thus the number of training datasets is increased by eight times; and lastly, adoption of landscape metrics to further improve the overall quality of results by removing false road objects. The most recent DCED approach for object segmentation, namely SegNet, is used as one of the benchmarks in evaluating our method. The experiments were conducted on a well-known aerial imagery, Massachusetts roads dataset (Mass. Roads), which is publicly available. The results showed that our method outperforms all of the baselines in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores."
"Knee implant orientation estimation for x-ray images using multiscale dual filter and linear regression model  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.For every patient who had total knee replacement, the routine follow-up is needed for a post-operation observation. The orientations of tibia, femur and knee implants are of clinical interest to orthopedic surgeons. In a routine follow-up examination, an orthopedic surgeon has to measure the tilt angles or orientations of knee implants manually from an x-ray film which is not quite accurate and inconvenient. This paper proposes an algorithm to automatically estimate the orientations of knee implants from an x-ray image using multiscale dual filter and linear regression model. The algorithm can remove tissues and noise while preserving and enhancing the bones. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on a set of 91 frontal view X-ray images of knee with implants and the experimental results, which were verified by the orthopedic surgeons, reveal 92% acceptance rate."
"Biphasic Effect of ATP on In Vitro Mineralization of Dental Pulp Cells  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Dental pulp cells release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in response to intrapulpal pressure and the amount released depends on the magnitude of the pressure. ATP regulates the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes and osteoblasts. However, it is unknown whether extracellular ATP influences the stemness and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs). Therefore, this study investigated the effects of extracellular ATP at a low (0.1 μM) and high (10 μM) concentration on the stemness and osteogenic differentiation of SHEDs. Cells were cultured in either growth medium or osteogenic medium with or without 0.1–10 μM ATP. In growth medium, both concentrations of ATP increased the mRNA expression of pluripotent and osteogenic markers. In contrast, in osteogenic medium, 0.1 μM ATP enhanced in vitro mineralization, whereas 10 μM ATP inhibited this process. In addition, 10 μM ATP stimulated the mRNA expression and activity of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP), an enzyme that regulates the phosphate/pyrophosphate ratio. Thus, depending on the growth condition and its concentration, ATP stimulated stemness and in vitro mineralization or inhibited mineralization. In growth medium, both ATP concentrations stimulated pluripotent and osteogenic marker gene expression. However, in osteogenic medium, a biphasic effect was found on in vitro mineralization; the low concentration stimulated, whereas the high concentration inhibited, mineralization. We propose that ATP released due to mechanical stress modulates the stemness and differentiation of SHEDs. J. Cell. Biochem. 119: 488–498, 2018.  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"Design and validation of affective warning pictorials on alcohol container labels  Springer International Publishing AG 2018.Affects in warning pictorials are essential in the warning effectiveness such as comprehension and hazard perception. The purpose of this research were to design and validate emotional warning pictorials for alcohol container labels in order to increase awareness of risks from alcohol consumptions. Survey and brainstorming techniques were used to collect the idea of possible affective warning pictorials. All ideas generated through those techniques were grouped for finding candidate pictorials. Sixty affective warning pictorials were designed and categorized into three affective state groups equally as positive, neutral, and negative. Forty Thai male participants participated in this study for affective warning pictorials’ validation. Participants were asked with agreement to attend the affective manipulation by watching pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) to adjust participants’ affective state as neutral state before starting the experiment. The Self-Assessment Manikin was used to assess valence and arousal of participants after seeing each of sixty affective warning pictorials. The result showed that affective warning pictorials were able to evoke specific affective state of warning pictorials to participants such as positive, neutral, and negative state. Affective warning pictorials from this research can be implemented as the alcohol container labels. The direction of future research will be focused on the study of comprehension, risk perception, and motivation to stop drinking alcohol after participants perceive affective warning pictorials."
"Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Plus Physical Therapy on Gait in Patients with Parkinson Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial  2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Objective The aim of the study was to study the combined effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and physical therapy on the walking ability of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Study Design The study used an experimental, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Results After intervention, group 1 (only tDCS) demonstrated a significant increase in gait speed by 0.13 to 0.14 m/sec (17.8%-19.2%) and an increase in step length by 5.9 to 6.1 cm (14.0%-14.5%), whereas group 2 (tDCS and physical therapy) revealed a significant increase in gait speed by 0.10 to 0.13 m/sec (14.9%-19.4%) and step length by 4.5 to 5.4 cm (10.6%-12.8%) and group 3 (sham tDCS and physical therapy) showed a significant increase in gait speed by 0.09 to 0.14 m/sec (13.0%-20.3%) and step length by 3.0 to 5.4 cm (6.8%-12.3%). All these results lasted for at least 8 wks after intervention. Upon comparing the parameters of gait among the three groups at every follow-up visit, no significant difference was observed. Conclusions Anodal tDCS or physical therapy could be used alone or together as a combination treatment to improve the walking speed of patients with Parkinson disease. The effects lasted for approximately 8 wks. The combination treatment was not superior to the use of tDCS or physical therapy alone."
"Pressure transmission area and maximum pressure transmission of different thermoplastic resin denture base materials under impact load  2017 Japan Prosthodontic SocietyPurposes The purposes of the present study were to examine the pressure transmission area and maximum pressure transmission of thermoplastic resin denture base materials under an impact load, and to evaluate the modulus of elasticity and nanohardness of thermoplastic resin denture base. Methods Three injection-molded thermoplastic resin denture base materials [polycarbonate (Basis PC), ethylene propylene (Duraflex), and polyamide (Valplast)] and one conventional heat-polymerized acrylic resin (PMMA, SR Triplex Hot) denture base, all with a mandibular first molar acrylic resin denture tooth set in were evaluated (n = 6). Pressure transmission area and maximum pressure transmission of the specimens under an impact load were observed by using pressure-sensitive sheets. The modulus of elasticity and nanohardness of each denture base (n = 10) were measured on 15 × 15 × 15 × 3 mm3 specimen by using an ultramicroindentation system. The pressure transmission area, modulus of elasticity, and nanohardness data were statistically analyzed with 1-way ANOVA, followed by Tamhane or Tukey HSD post hoc test (α =.05). The maximum pressure transmission data were statistically analyzed with Kruskal–Wallis H test, followed by Mann–Whitney U test (α =.05). Results Polymethyl methacrylate showed significantly larger pressure transmission area and higher maximum pressure transmission than the other groups (P <.001). Significant differences were found in modulus of elasticity and nanohardness among the four types of denture bases (P <.001). Conclusions Pressure transmission area and maximum pressure transmission varied among the thermoplastic resin denture base materials. Differences in the modulus of elasticity and nanohardness of each type of denture base were demonstrated."

"The effect of iloprost on cell proliferation and angiogenesis-related gene expression in human periodontal ligament cells  2017, The Society of The Nippon Dental University.Periodontal ligament is considered a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells for pulp regeneration. This study investigated the effect of iloprost, a prostacyclin analog, on cell proliferation and the expression of angiogenesis-related genes in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLs) in vitro. The hPDLs were treated with 10−9–10−6 M iloprost for 1, 6 and 24 h. Cell proliferation was determined by an MTT assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), alpha-1 type I collagen (COL1), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA expression were determined by semi-quantitative and qPCR. ELISA was employed for assessment of VEGF expression. Immunofluorescence staining for COL1 protein expression was performed. A prostacyclin receptor (IP) antagonist was used to verify the signaling pathway. The Kruskal–Wallis and Tukey significant difference tests were used to analyze the results. From the results, iloprost treatment did not affect cell morphology or proliferation. Iloprost induced the upregulation of VEGF and COL1 mRNA levels as shown by PCR. The effect of iloprost on bFGF mRNA expression was not observed. The immunofluorescence assay revealed that COL1 protein expression was increased in the iloprost groups. Pretreating the hPDLs with the IP antagonist significantly suppressed the enhancing effect of iloprost on VEGF and COL1 mRNA expression and suppressed COL1 protein expression. In conclusion, iloprost promoted mRNA and protein expression of VEGF and COL1, but not of bFGF in hPDL cells. The increased effect of iloprost was abolished by IP receptor antagonist pretreatment. Iloprost might be a promising agent in dentin-pulp regeneration."
"Dynamic Responses of Interspersed Railway Tracks to Moving Train Loads  2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.This paper investigates novel dynamic phenomena of interspersed railway tracks. The interspersed method is commonly carried out by spot-replacing old timber sleepers with new concrete sleepers. Although this interspersed approach provides a short-term solution, such method has a negative effect on the long-term performance of railway tracks. It is evident that the performance of interspersed tracks can quickly deteriorate after some years. As a result, this paper is the first to evaluate dynamic responses of the interspersed track caused by a moving train load in order to understand the root cause of swift track deterioration. Interspersed track models in three-dimensional space have been developed using a finite element package, STRAND7. The model was validated earlier with experimental results. Parametric studies have been conducted to evaluate dynamic responses of the interspersed railway tracks, including dynamic displacement, frontal uplift, rear uplift and accelerations of rail over sleeper, rail at midspan, sleeper at rail seat, and sleeper at midspan. Dynamic amplification phenomena are highlighted as they convey a new insight into dynamic phenomena identifying the real source of track deterioration."
"Curable precursors derived from chemical recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polylactic acid and physical properties of their thermosetting (co)polyesters  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Curable precursors for production of thermosetting (co)polyesters are developed based on poly(butylene adipate) (PBA), poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(lactic acid) (PLA). The precursors are prepared from methacrylation of their hydroxyl-terminated oligomers. These include commercial HO-capped PBA prepolymer (HO-PBA), and bis-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and glycolized PLA (GPLA), which are obtained from glycolysis reactions of their post-consumer products and original resin. The optimal conditions for methacrylation of each prepolymer, i.e., molar ratios of prepolymer to methacrylic anhydride (MAAH), temperature and time, are examined. The most efficient conditions are 1:4/120 °C/3 h (HO-PBA), 1:2.5/120 °C/2 h (BHET), and 1:4/140 °C/3 h (GPLA), respectively. These conditions are justified, where the highest degree of substitution and double bond content are obtained without self-curing side reaction. The resulting methacrylated precursors from HO-PBA and BHET are isothermally cured faster than those of GPLA. Thermosetting copolyesters developed from binary mixtures of the precursors possess tunable thermal stability, and physical and mechanical properties. The degradable copolyesters can be applied in various applications, especially in packaging and agricultural fields."
"Effect of harvesting age and performance evaluation on biogasification from Napier grass in separated stages process  2017, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Napier grass is a potent source of biomass commonly grown throughout the tropics. Here the effects of harvesting age and performance evaluation on Napier grass biogasification were investigated. Three different harvesting ages of fresh Pakchong-1 Napier grass at 35, 45, and 55 days were digested. Two separated stages process, combining Completely Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) and Anaerobic Baffle Reactor (ABR), was then operated for acidification and methanation. The results depicted that the different grass harvesting ages promoted different characteristics of biomass feedstock in particular for total solid, lignin content, and C/N ratio. The different gases production potentials about 70.8–164.6 ml biogas/g VSadded and 32.9–84.5 ml CH4/g VSadded were then promoted. The acidification of 45 days harvesting age at 1.5–3.0% (VS) in CSTR generated the different acid production for 5.9–7.5 g/l. The selected solid load of 2.0% VS generated about 21.1 g CODtotal/l or 7.5 g TVA/g VSadded. This was solubilized for almost 50% and consisted of acetic acid for 77.2–82.2%. The gases production from this hydrolysate in ABR was stably operated and produced about 484.0 and 267.8 ml /g CODremoved for biogas and methane, respectively. This result depicted the possibility of biogas production from Pakchong-1 Napier grass employing two separated stages process."
"Iron deficiency anemia interfering the diagnosis of compound heterozygosity for Hb constant spring and Hb Paksé: The first case report  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Diagnosis of thalassemia or hemoglobinopathy concomitant with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is challenging. Method: We report a case of 43-year-old female whose diagnosis of compound heterozygosity for hemoglobin Constant Spring (HbCS) and Hb Paksé became apparent after the treatment of IDA. Results: Prior to treatment, Hb analysis using isoelectric focusing (IEF) showed HbA 95.6%, HbA2 2.7%, and HbCS 1.7% compatible with heterozygous HbCS. After 4 months of oral iron therapy resulting in an improved Hb level, her HbCS level was substantially increased to 8.7% on IEF suggesting homozygous HbCS. Subsequent DNA analysis using multiplex amplification refractory mutation system analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for HbCS and Hb Paksé. Conclusion: This case demonstrated that IDA can significantly reduce HbCS/Hb Paksé levels and probably mask the diagnosis of homozygous HbCS, homozygous Hb Paksé or the compound heterozygosity for both hemoglobinopathies by hemoblogin analysis. The test should be repeated after resolution of IDA, or molecular testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis."
"Association between leukocyte telomere length and angiogenic cytokines in knee osteoarthritis  2017 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdAim: The aims of this study were to compare leukocyte relative telomere length (RTL) in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients and healthy controls and to investigate associations between plasma angiogenic cytokine concentrations and leukocyte RTL. Method: Eighty knee OA patients and 60 age-matched controls were enrolled. Leukocyte RTL was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Angiogenic cytokines were measured by a multiplex immunoassay. Results: Leukocyte RTL in knee OA patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (1.1 ± 0.4 vs. 1.3 ± 0.6, P = 0.039). Plasma angiopoietin-2, follistatin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in knee OA patients were higher than those in controls (P < 0.01). Correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlations between leukocyte RTL and plasma levels of HGF (r = −0.377, P = 0.017), VEGF (r = −0.405, P = 0.009) and G-CSF (r = −0.347, P = 0.026). In contrast, plasma angiopoietin-2, follistatin, IL-8, leptin, platelet-derived growth factor-BB and PECAM-1 were not correlated with leukocyte RTL. Conclusion: Telomere length was shortened in knee OA patients compared to healthy controls. Plasma HGF, VEGF and G-CSF were negatively correlated with leukocyte RTL, suggesting involvement of telomere shortening and these cytokines in knee OA."
"Anaerobic co-digestion of hydrolysate from alkali pre-treated oil palm empty fruit bunches with biodiesel waste glycerol  2017, Springer Japan.With an attempt to utilize bio-waste, oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) were investigated as feedstock for biogas production. Bench scale experiments were carried out employing a two-stage process for the digestion of pre-treated OPEFB with and without the addition of biodiesel waste glycerol (WG). Two continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) were operated for acid and methane production. Alkali pre-treated OPEFB were initially acidified to produce an acid hydrolysate solution. Different proportions of WG, between 0.4 and 0.8% (by volume of feed), were increased stepwise. The results indicated that the acidification of these pre-treated brunches generated approximately 4.25 g/L of volatile fatty acid at an optimum pre-treatment condition with soaking in 2% of NaOH for 48 h. This was an increase of 47% compared to the acidification of raw OPEFB. The maximum methane production was achieved with the addition of 0.4% WG, which yielded a gas production of 0.542 and 0.369 L g CODrem biogas and methane, respectively. These conditions can improve the gas yield of biogas and methane by a factor of 1.67 and 2.84, respectively. However, a higher supplementation of WG seemed to promote more instability, which was reflected by a lower methane concentration and organic removal efficiency."
"Bullying at work: Cognitive appraisal of negative acts, coping, wellbeing, and performance  2016 American Psychological Association.The negative outcomes of experiencing workplace bullying are well documented, but a strong theoretical explanation for this has been relatively neglected. We draw on cognitive appraisal theory to suggest that individual's appraisals of and responses to negative acts at work will moderate the impact of said acts on wellbeing and performance outcomes. In a large study (N = 3,217) in Southeast Asia, we examine moderators in the form of (a) the extent to which individuals identify themselves as being bullied and (b) the coping strategies that individuals use to deal with negative acts. We find that these factors do moderate the impact of experiencing negative acts, in particular work-related negative acts. When individuals are subject to work-related negative acts but do not see themselves as being bullied they report higher levels of performance than those who do identify themselves as being bullied. Problemfocused coping was found to be effective for those sometimes targeted, but for persistent targets was detrimental to wellbeing. The present research has important implications for bullying research in examining factors that contribute to outcomes of bullying."
"Three-dimensional interaction diagram for the undrained capacity of inverted T-shape strip footings under general loading  2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper presents new solutions of a three-dimensional (3D) interaction diagram for the undrained capacity of inverted T-shape strip footings under general loading. The two-dimensional plane strain finite-element analysis was employed to determine the stability of this problem. Parametric studies were performed to study the interactions of the combined vertical load (V), horizontal load (H) and bending moment (M) that were applied on top of the inverted T-shape footing. The combined action of vertical forces included both tensile (upward) and compressive (downward) loadings. The results of these analyses were summarised in terms of the dimensionless factors for V, H and M. Failure mechanisms associated with different locations on the 3D interaction diagram were compared and discussed. A closed-form approximate solution of the 3D interaction diagram for inverted T-shape strip footings under the V-H-M loading was proposed and compared with the finite-element solutions."
"Changing patterns of civil-military relations and thailand’s regional outlook  1998 Taylor & Francis, except for Chapter 2, which is  by Rebecca L. Schiff.The Thai military faces new challenges with the end of the Cold War. Thailand’s external security environment has been transformed by the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia in 1990. The long-standing internal battle with the Communist Party has been resolved in the military’s favor. Moreover, the transformation of Thailand’s political ideology and institutions have wrought fundamental changes in civil-military relations. This chapter explores how the evolution of domestic and international politics has redefined Thai civil-military relations. In turn, it discusses the implications of changes in civil-military relations on Thailand’s goals and behavior in the regional context."
