['Physics and Astronomy (all)'],"Democratic Lagrangians for Nonlinear Electrodynamics  2021 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.We construct a Lagrangian for general nonlinear electrodynamics that features electric and magnetic potentials on equal footing. In the language of this Lagrangian, discrete and continuous electric-magnetic duality symmetries can be straightforwardly imposed, leading to a simple formulation for theories with the SO(2) duality invariance. When specialized to the conformally invariant case, our construction provides a manifestly duality-symmetric formulation of the recently discovered ModMax theory. We briefly comment on a natural generalization of this approach to p-forms in 2p+2 dimensions."

All rights reserved.Developing complex algorithms on 8-bit processors without proper development tools is challenging. This paper integrates a series of novel techniques to improve the development cycle for 8-bit soft-macros such as Xilinx PicoBlaze. The improvements proposed in this paper reduce development time significantly by eliminating the required resynthesis of the whole design upon HDL source code changes. Additionally, a technique is proposed to increase the maximum supported data memory size for PicoBlaze which facilitates development of complex algorithms. Also, a general verification technique is proposed based on a series of testbenches that perform code verification using comparison method. The proposed testbench scenario integrates “Inter-Processor Communication (IPC), shared memory, and interrupt” concepts that lays out a guideline for FPGA developers to verify their own designs using the proposed method. The proposed development cycle relies on a chip that has Programmable Logic (PL) fabric (to hold the soft processor) alongside of a hardened processor (to be used as algorithm verifier), therefore, a Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC is chosen which has a hardened ARM processor. The development cycle proposed in this paper targets the PicoBlaze, but it can be easily ported to other FPGA macros such as Lattice Mico8, or any non-Xilinx FPGA macros."

METHODS We conducted an open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing three-drug ART based on the HIV integrase inhibitor dolutegravir with standard care (non–dolutegravir-based ART) in children and adolescents starting first- or second-line ART. The primary end point was the proportion of participants with virologic or clinical treatment failure by 96 weeks, as estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method. Safety was assessed. RESULTS From September 2016 through June 2018, a total of 707 children and adolescents who weighed at least 14 kg were randomly assigned to receive dolutegravir-based ART (350 participants) or standard care (357). The median age was 12.2 years (range, 2.9 to 18.0), the median weight was 30.7 kg (range, 14.0 to 85.0), and 49% of the participants were girls. By design, 311 participants (44%) started first-line ART (with 92% of those in the standard-care group receiving efavirenz-based ART), and 396 (56%) started second-line ART (with 98% of those in the standard-care group receiving boosted protease inhibitor–based ART). The median followup was 142 weeks. By 96 weeks, 47 participants in the dolutegravir group and 75 in the standard-care group had treatment failure (estimated probability, 0.14 vs. 0.22; difference, –0.08; 95% confidence interval, −0.14 to −0.03; P=0.004). Treatment effects were similar with first- and second-line therapies (P=0.16 for heterogeneity). A total of 35 participants in the dolutegravir group and 40 in the standard-care group had at least one serious adverse event (P=0.53), and 73 and 86, respectively, had at least one adverse event of grade 3 or higher (P=0.24). At least one ART-modifying adverse event occurred in 5 participants in the dolutegravir group and in 17 in the standard-care group (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving children and adolescents with HIV-1 infection who were starting first- or second-line treatment, dolutegravir-based ART was superior to standard care.

The result suggests that gold generally provides a hedge for the stock market and industry indexes, and that it also works as a safe haven for stocks in some crises. However, bonds tend to offer less hedging effect. In fact, the correlations between bonds and stocks even increase in some crises, contradicting a common belief that bonds are a safe haven for stocks. A possible explanation for this striking finding is that since stocks and bonds share similar sources of companies' cash flows, bonds are viewed as risky as stocks in times of extreme market volatilities and hence market players treat them as one and the same. Finally, these hedging and safe haven effects are observed in some, but not all, industries and they do not behave consistently in every crisis."

Published by American Chemical Society.We utilized a one-step hydrothermal process for the synthesis of precious metal-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2)/graphene oxide (GO) composites. The metal-doped TiO2/GO composites, including silver–TiO2/GO (Ag–TiO2/GO), palladium–TiO2/GO (Pd–TiO2/GO), and copper–TiO2/GO (Cu–TiO2/GO), were synthesized by mixing a metal precursor, titanium butoxide, and graphene oxide in a water–ethanol mixture in an autoclave hydrothermal reactor. The photocatalytic performance of the composites was tested in the photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to ethanol. Ag–TiO2/GO, Pd–TiO2/GO, and Cu–TiO2/GO exhibited an ethanol production rate of 109, 125, and 233 μmol/gcat h, respectively. The outstanding performances of Cu–TiO2/GO can be attributed to a combined effect of key parameters, including optical band gap, crystallite size, and BET surface area."

Charge-carrier mobility is an important factor that affects the performance of tandem solar cells. However, a detailed understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of lead mixed-halide perovskites remains elusive. Here, we used LO (longitudinal optical) phonons and alloy scattering to the elucidate charge-carrier mobilities in the FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3hybrid perovskite system. It was found that these scattering mechanisms provided very good quantitative agreement with the experimental results, between 11-40 cm2V−1s−1. Our findings provide new insights into charge transport scattering in lead mixed-halide hybrid perovskites and pave the way toward design of novel semiconductor alloys for solar cell applications."

A search for long-lived particles (LLPs) produced in decays of standard model (SM) Higgs bosons is presented. The data sample consists of 137 fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at s=13 TeV, recorded at the LHC in 2016-2018. A novel technique is employed to reconstruct decays of LLPs in the end cap muon detectors. The search is sensitive to a broad range of LLP decay modes and to masses as low as a few GeV. No excess of events above the SM background is observed. The most stringent limits to date on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to LLPs subsequently decaying to quarks and τ+τ- are found for proper decay lengths greater than 6, 20, and 40 m, for LLP masses of 7, 15, and 40 GeV, respectively."

Estimated cost from food-borne illnesses is USD 110 billion per year, which is an economic burden to low- and middle-income countries. Thailand is a leading producer and consumer of seafood, but little is known about bacterial contamination in seafood. In particular, public health agencies need to know the relationship between Salmonella contamination in seafood and risk factors, as assessed with readily available culture-dependent and bacterial phenotyping methods. To address this, levels of indicator bacteria, Salmonella and Vibrio in various seafood products were determined to identify risk factors associated with Salmonella contamination. A total of 335 samples were collected from October 2018 to July 2019 at seafood markets throughout Bangkok, Thailand; overall sample composition was Pacific white shrimp (n = 85), oysters (n = 82), blood cockles (n = 84), and Asian seabass (n = 84). Prevalence was 100% for fecal coliforms and 85% for E. coli. In contrast, prevalence was 59% for V. parahaemolyticus, 49% for V. cholerae, 19% for V. alginolyticus, 18% for V. vulnificus, and 36% for Salmonella. Highest concentrations of fecal coliforms and E. coli were in oysters. Highest concentrations of Salmonella with Matopeni (31%) being the predominant serotype were in shrimp. Salmonella contamination was significantly associated with type of seafood, sampling location, retail conditions, and the presence of E. coli, V. alginolyticus and V. vulnificus. A cutoff value for E. coli concentration of 1.3 × 104 MPN/g predicted contamination of Salmonella, with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 61%. Displaying seafood products on ice, presence of E. coli and Vibrio, and seafood derived from Eastern Thailand were associated with an increased risk of Salmonella contamination."

The papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key promising target for antiviral drug development since it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and innate immunity. Here, we employed the all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations based on MM-PB(GB)SA and SIE methods to elucidate and compare the binding behaviors of five inhibitors derived from peptidomimetic inhibitors (VIR250 and VIR251) and naphthalene-based inhibitors (GRL-0617, compound 3, and compound Y96) against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The obtained results revealed that all inhibitors interacting within the PLpro active site are mostly driven by vdW interactions, and the hydrogen bond formation in residues G163 and G271 with peptidomimetics and the Q269 residue with naphthalene-based inhibitors was essential for stabilizing the protein–ligand complexes. Among the five studied inhibitors, VIR250 exhibited the most binding efficiency with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, and thus, it was chosen for the rational drug design. Based on the computationally designed ligand–protein complexes, the replacement of aromatic rings including heteroatoms (e.g., thiazolopyridine) at the P2 and P4 sites could help to improve the inhibitor-binding efficiency. Furthermore, the hydrophobic interactions with residues at P1–P3 sites can be increased by enlarging the nonpolar moieties (e.g., ethene) at the N-terminal of VIR250. We expect that the structural data obtained will contribute to the development of new PLpro inhibitors with more inhibitory potency for COVID-19."

PLWH are highly vulnerable to nutritional problems resulting from agingrelated deterioration, disease itself, and adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The comprehensive nutritional assessments are necessary to perform routinely in this population to monitor and provide appropriate interventions to reduce comorbid conditions. In this review, we focus on the untoward impacts of malnutrition and nutritional assessments on the morbidity and mortality in the older PLWH. Some predictive factors of nutritional status in this group of patients are discussed. We propose the important components for nutrition assessment tool for older PLWH on ART. Highlighted issue is the need for developing uniform standardized tools for the early diagnosis of malnutrition in this population. Applications of the nutritional assessments, proper nutritional interventions, and regular monitoring of nutritional status in older PLWH liv-ing in every clinical setting may help the patients get better well-being."

However, large thermal energy consumption for CO2 desorption during amine regeneration has limited large-scale worldwide applications. Here, we show that an efficient MCM-41-SO3H-0.6 catalyst presented a superior catalytic performance, decreasing the relative heat duty by one-third and enhancing the instantaneous desorption rate by up to 195% in comparison with the monoethanolamine (MEA) regeneration without catalysts. The excellent catalytic activity is related to the combination of the properties of mesopore surface area × total acid sites, and a possible catalytic mechanism is proposed for the MCM-41-SO3H catalysts. Furthermore, the experimental results in the MEA solution regeneration process were consistent with density functional theory calculations in revealing the catalytic desorption mechanism. This work demonstrated that MCM-41 functionalized with sulfonic acid group catalysts could play an essential role in the post-combustion CO2 capture technology using aqueous MEA for industrial applications."

This study evaluated a previously developed automatic WPG segmentation, deep attentive neural network (DANN), on a large, continuous patient cohort to test its feasibility in a clinical setting. With IRB approval and HIPAA compliance, the study cohort included 3,698 3T MRI scans acquired between 2016 and 2020. In total, 335 MRI scans were used to train the model, and 3,210 and 100 were used to conduct the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the model. In addition, the DANN-enabled prostate volume estimation was evaluated by using 50 MRI scans in comparison with manual prostate volume estimation. For qualitative evaluation, visual grading was used to evaluate the performance of WPG segmentation by two abdominal radiologists, and DANN demonstrated either acceptable or excellent performance in over 96% of the testing cohort on the WPG or each prostate sub-portion (apex, midgland, or base). Two radiologists reached a substantial agreement on WPG and midgland segmentation (κ = 0.75 and 0.63) and moderate agreement on apex and base segmentation (κ = 0.56 and 0.60). For quantitative evaluation, DANN demonstrated a dice similarity coefficient of 0.93 ± 0.02, significantly higher than other baseline methods, such as DeepLab v3+ and UNet (both p values < 0.05). For the volume measurement, 96% of the evaluation cohort achieved differences between the DANN-enabled and manual volume measurement within 95% limits of agreement. In conclusion, the study showed that the DANN achieved sufficient and consistent WPG segmentation on a large, continuous study cohort, demonstrating its great potential to serve as a tool to measure prostate volume."

Converting lignocellulosic biomass to sugar is a complicated system involved in the bioconversion process. There are indeed a variety of techniques that have been utilized in the bioconversion process consisting of physical, chemical, and biological approaches. However, most of them have drawbacks when used on a large scale, which include the high cost of processing, the development of harmful inhibitors, and the detoxification of the inhibitors that have been produced. These constraints, taken together, hinder the effectiveness of current solutions and demand for the invention of a new, productive, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable technique for LB processing. In this context, the approach of nanotechnology utilizing various nanomaterials and nanoparticles in treating lignocellulose biomass and bioenergy conversion has achieved increased interest and has been explored greatly in recent times. This mini review delves into the application of nanotechnological techniques in the bioconversion of lignocellulose biomass into bioenergy.

Most developing countries are facing significant challenges associated with recycling practices. In Thailand, 90% of the plastic recycling businesses are categorized as small-scale enterprises. There is still a dearth of research on health risk assessments associated with indoor exposure in small-scale waste recycling. This research aims to apply a holistic approach of integrated health risk and life cycle assessment concepts in investigating occupational exposure to all potential hazards in small-scale polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) recycling plants in Thailand. The results indicated that all exposure levels of heat stress in wet bulb globe temperature in the melting/extrusion stage exceeded the Thai and global Occupational safety and health (OSH) threshold limits for workers with heavy workloads. For workers’ exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the average total VOCs concentrations emitted from PP and PE recycling were 1625 μg/m3 and 1190 μg/m3, respectively. Hexane and toluene were remarkably found in the extrusion process. The non-cancer hazard quotients (HQs) and hazard indices (HIs) were higher in PP than in PE. The adverse non-cancer risks were concerned in plants that recycle only PP wastes at full capacity (100%) loaded operation (HQs and HIs >1). Recycling facility concentrating more on PE recycling tends to reduce risk to workers. By integrating the revised one box model into the life cycle impact assessment, the results demonstrate that the health impact from indoor VOCs exposure due to the production of 1 kg of recycled PP or PE resin was significantly greatest. Workers in the extrusion process were considered at higher risk of exposure to VOCs and heat. This research makes important contributions to the literature by providing insights into environmental health management and implications for cleaner production in plastic waste recycling. The promotion of effective engineering controls and development of collaborative circular business models in plastic waste recycling sector were highly recommended to increase resource efficiency and promote sustainable production patterns."

Global estimation of mangrove soil organic carbon (SOC) storage requires detailed regional studies, but estimates of SOC data in deep soils are currently missing in many countries. Furthermore, little is explored on the molecular composition of mangrove SOC. Here, we assessed the SOC stock in a Trat mangrove forest (Thailand) by collecting deep soils (3.5 m) and analyzed the SOC composition for better understanding its potential sources and influencing factors. The Trat mangrove forest had four times higher SOC stock than has been considered for Thai mangrove forests, with the per-area SOC stock of nearly 1000 Mg C ha–1 which rivals that of Indo-Pacific mangrove forests. The SOC composition analyzed by C/N ratios and spectroscopic techniques differed by tree species and depth. Compositional data principal component analysis revealed that a biological factor (root abundance) had stronger influences than the soil texture (sand versus clay) on the abundance and composition of mangrove SOC. Although surface soil (~1 m) C density was largely controlled by the recent vegetation, deep soil C density reflected other historical processes. This study contributed to a refined estimate of Thailand mangrove SOC stock and revealed that factors influencing SOC abundance and composition differ by tree species and depth."

"['Pharmacology', 'Biological Psychiatry']","Translational evidence for the Inflammatory Response System (IRS)/Compensatory Immune Response System (CIRS) and neuroprogression theory of major depression  2021 Elsevier Inc.Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, severe and disabling neuropsychiatric disorder with a heterogenous etiology. Among the most widely recognized etiological models, immunopathogenesis is a predominant one. Numerous studies have demonstrated aberrant levels of inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain of patients with MDD. Multiple studies including meta-analyses have reported increased peripheral levels of acute phase proteins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in MDD. Postmortem brain studies similarly demonstrated upregulated expressions of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. This along with evidence of monocytic, lymphocytic and microglial activation, suggest an activated inflammatory response system (IRS) in MDD. A few studies show increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines or defective inflammatory pathways and a deficit in T cell maturation and responses in MDD patients. This suggests the presence of a Compensatory Immune Response System (CIRS), which can counterbalance the effects of IRS in major depression. More recently, simultaneously increased levels of both the pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines are reported in the brain of MDD patients; this indicates activity of both the IRS and CIRS in MDD. The IRS and CIRS are the evolutionarily conserved and integral elements of an overarching system. The relevance of a dysregulated IRS-CIRS system in the neurobiological construct of MDD is just beginning to be understood. Speculation is rife that the disrupted IRS-CIRS elements might determine the onset, episodes, neuroprogressive processes, treatment response as well as recovery of patients with MDD. Notably, the signatures of an activated IRS-CIRS might emerge as potential biomarkers of MDD. Herein, an attempt has been made to highlight the biology and pathobiological relevance of IRS-CIRS activation in MDD and provide an insight into the role of these components in pharmacological therapy."

The persistence of parasites and the recurrence of the disease after treatment are challenges in controlling the disease. To explore efficient prophylaxis and therapy, this study aimed to investigate infection outcome and organ-specific immune responses after inoculation with L. martiniquensis (MHOM/TH/2011/PG; 5 x 106 promastigotes) in BALB/c mice via intravenous and intraperitoneal routes. A quantitative PCR technique, targeting L. martiniquensis ITS1, was primarily established to estimate the parasite burden. We found that the infection in the liver resolved; however, persistent infection was observed in the spleen. Histopathology with Leishmania-specific immunostaining revealed efficient hepatic granuloma formation, while splenic disorganization with parasitized macrophages at different locations was demonstrated. The mRNA expression of Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12p40) and iNOS in the liver and spleen was upregulated. In addition, high expression of IL-10 was observed in the spleen in the chronic phase, revealing a significant moderate correlation with the parasite persistence [r(12) = 0.72, P = 0.009]. Further clarification of the mechanisms of persistent infection and experimental infection in immunosuppressed murine models are warranted."

However, there has been little synthesis of the strength and quality of this evidence in aggregate to date. Objective: To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of RCTs that assessed the associations of IF (zero-calorie alternate-day fasting, modified alternate-day fasting, the 5:2 diet, and time-restricted eating) with obesity-related health outcomes. Evidence Review: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched from database inception to January 12, 2021. Data analysis was conducted from April 2021 through July 2021. Meta-analyses of RCTs investigating effects of IF in adults were included. The effect sizes of IF were recalculated using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence per association by applying the GRADE criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) as high, moderate, low, and very low. Findings: A total of 11 meta-analyses comprising 130 RCTs (median [IQR] sample size, 38 [24-69] participants; median [IQR] follow-up period, 3 [2-5] months) were included describing 104 unique associations of different types of IF with obesity-related health outcomes (median [IQR] studies per association, 4 [3-5]). There were 28 statistically significant associations (27%) that demonstrated the beneficial outcomes for body mass index, body weight, fat mass, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and blood pressure. IF was found to be associated with reduced fat-free mass. One significant association (1%) supported by high-quality evidence was modified alternate-day fasting for 1 to 2 months, which was associated with moderate reduction in body mass index in healthy adults and adults with overweight, obesity, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease compared with regular diet. Six associations (6%) were supported by moderate quality evidence. The remaining associations found to be significant were supported by very low (75 associations [72%]) to low (22 associations [21%]) quality evidence. Conclusions and Relevance: In this umbrella review, we found beneficial associations of IF with anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes supported by moderate to high quality of evidence, which supports the role of IF, especially modified alternate-day fasting, as a weight loss approach for adults with overweight or obesity. More clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to investigate the effects of IF on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality."

All Rights Reserved.The source area of the Yellow River (SAYR) contributes over one third of the basin discharge and bears disproportionate significance to water conservation in China. Hydroclimate changes in the SAYR, therefore, have potential far-reaching socioeconomic consequences. However, the major drivers of the SAYR hydroclimate remain poorly understood, largely due to limited hydroclimatic records. Here, we analyzed the organic, carbonate contents and stable isotopes of 14C-dated sediments from Ngoring Lake to reconstruct regional hydroclimate spanning the last ∼2,000 years. The results suggest that the SAYR experienced a near-millennium-long drying trend since the Medieval Warm Period, regardless of temperature changes and meltwater inputs. This trend, coherent with hydroclimate records from north China, is likely forced by a reduction in tropical Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient. Furthermore, our records have significant implications for other parts of the Tibetan Plateau that will likely develop similar hydroclimate conditions to the SAYR in the future."

Herein, kinetics of CO2 methanation over Ni/ZrO2 was studied using a tubular quartz reactor at 0.9 MPa. The Sabatier reaction (CO2 + 4H2 = CH4 + 2H2O, ΔHr298K = – 165 kJ mol–1) was carried out under stoichiometric gas feeding (CO2/H2 = 1/4 v/v to CH4/H2O = 1/2 v/v), and its reaction rate was determined. The exothermic nature of CO2 methanation and extremely high catalytic activities increased the reaction temperature to 400–600 °C even when the feed-gas temperature was as low as 250–400 °C, and the gas hourly space velocity was as high as 3 × 106 h–1. Nonlinear regression analyses based on one- and multistep kinetic models were used to investigate the reaction rates to estimate the kinetic parameters. Both models with optimized parameters can reproduce the experimentally obtained CH4 formation rates for the entire range of the feed-gas conversion with a coefficient of determination (R2) of over 0.98."

All rights reserved.Background:This study investigated the sustained virologic responses (SVRs) among prisoners with hepatitis C virus (HCV) using universal test-and-treat approach by prison health care workers in a central male prison in Thailand.Methods:A universal HCV screening was conducted in a maximum-security central prison (Klong Prem Central Prison) in Thailand. HCV RNA-confirmed prisoners were treated with generic sofosbuvir/velpatasvir by prison health care workers, regardless of their HCV genotypes and duration of prison sentences. We evaluated the SVR rates at 12 weeks after completing direct acting antivirals (DAA) treatment.Results:A total of 68 prisoners with detectable HCV RNA received DAA treatment. The median age and duration of prison sentences were 44 years (interquartile range, 41-53) and 25 (interquartile range, 19-33) years, respectively. Twenty-five percentage of the participants was coinfected with HIV, and 6% of the participants was coinfected with hepatitis B virus. Among all prisoners who received DAA treatment, 20 (29%) had genotype (GT)-1a, 3 (4%) had GT-1b, 22 (32%) had GT-3a, 3 (4%) had GT-3b, and 7 (10%) had GT-6. Overall, improvements in liver biomarkers were seen after HCV treatment, and SVR was achieved in 97% of the participants with per-protocol analysis and in 90% of the participants with intention-to-treat analysis.Conclusions:HCV treatment using DAA among prisoners through universal test-and-treat approach led by prison health care workers is highly effective and safe, and such model can potentially help to facilitate the goals of HCV microelimination among prisoners in Thailand."

The results suggest that, regardless of pressure, 2H-W(Se1−xTex)2 exhibits a tendency toward local phase segregation into 2H-WSe2 and 2H-WTe2 (or 1Td-WTe2) as the temperature approaches 0 K. The critical temperature, at which 2H-W(Se1−xTex)2 is stable as a single-phase random solid solution over the entire composition range is, on the other hand, predicted to increase with the applied pressure. Upon increasing the pressure, the electronic band gap of 2H-W(Se1−xTex)2 shrinks, and it finally undergoes the semiconductor-to-semimetal transition. The magnitude and the shrinkage rate of the band gap are found to be affected both by the degree of compression and by the alloy composition. These findings offer a possibility to engineer the electronic properties of 2H-W(Se1−xTex)2 by varying its composition and also the pressure applied on it for future utilization of the alloy in electronic devices operating in a high-pressure environment."

All rights reserved.The insight in structures of the blood vessels is a basis for study of blood flows to help understanding the abnormalities of blood vessels that can cause vascular diseases. Basic concept used for constructing structures of blood vessels in organs is arterial branching, which is usually characterized by fractal similarity in the bifurcation pattern. In this work, the concept of Lindenmayer system (L-system) is modified for three-dimensional (3D) tree-like structures to model structures of blood vessels in organs, and then, applied to construct and visualize structural blood vessels via our software created based on openGL and Lazarus program. The structure of blood vessels is constructed based on the physiological law of arterial branching proposed Murray (Murray’s law) under additional assumptions and constraints such as the spreading of blood vessels to cover all directions, the angle condition and the non-overlapping vessels condition. The concept is applied to simulate structures of blood vessels in 3 study cases, including symmetric arterial branching, non-symmetric arterial branching and structure of blood vessel on different domains. The results of structures of blood vessels generated from all cases are measured based on the number of segments, the total blood volume and the fractal dimension. The results of modeling and simulation in this work are illustrated by comparing with other results appeared literature. Moreover, the constructed structures of the blood vessels based on this 3D L-system could be useful for future research such as blood flow, pressure and other properties involving in structures of blood vessels in different organs of human and animals."

In dental aspect, reconstruction of the resorbed alveolar bone after tooth extraction plays an important role in the success of dental substitution, especially in dental implant treatment. The hydroxyapatite (HA)-incorporated fibroin-alginate composite injectable hydrogel was fabricated to be used as scaffold for bone regeneration. HA was synthesized from eggshell biowaste. Fibroin was extracted from Bombyx mori cocoon. The synthesized HA, fibroin and alginate hydrogel were characterized. HA-incorporated fibroin-alginate hydrogel had decreased pore size and porosity compared with pure alginate hydrogel. Thermal analysis showed that hydrogel had a degradation peak of approximately 250 °C. Hydrogel could absorb water, with a swelling ratio of around 300% at 24 h. Hydrogel was degraded as time passed and almost completely degraded at day 7. Its compressive Young's modulus was approximately 0.04 ± 0.02 N/mm2 to 0.10 ± 0.02 N/mm2. Primary cytotoxicity test indicated non-toxic potential of the fabricated hydrogel. Increased ALP activity was observed in MC3T3-E1 cultured in HA-incorporated fibroin-alginate hydrogel. Results suggested the potential use of injectable HA fibroin-alginate hydrogel as dental scaffolding material.

This study enhanced the LR-CDs production by Thermus filiformis amylomaltase (TfAM) enzyme by starch pretreatment using glycogen debranching enzyme from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgGDE). CgGDE pretreated tapioca starch gave LR-CD conversion of 31.2 ± 2.2%, compared with LR-CDs produced from non-treated tapioca starch (16.0 ± 2.4%). CgGDE pretreatment enhanced amylose content by approximately 30%. Notably, a shorter incubation time of 1 h is sufficient for CgGDE starch pretreatment to produce high LR-CD yield, compared with 6 h required for the commercial isoamylase. High-Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography coupled with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD) and Gel Permeable Chromatography (GPC) revealed that CgGDE is more efficient than the commercial isoamylase in debranching tapioca starch and gave lower molecular weight products. In addition, lower amount of by-products (linear oligosaccharides) were detected in cyclization reaction when using CgGDE-pretreated starch. In conclusion, CgGDE is a highly effective enzyme to promote LR-CD synthesis from starch with a shorter incubation time than the commercial isoamylase."

The simulated results revealed that scandenin preferentially located within all the studied βCDs nanocavities by inserting its hydroxyphenyl ring and pyran terminal close to the narrow and wider rims (conf-A), respectively. In another feasible orientation (conf-B), the guest substance was deeply included into the lipophilic cavity of only 6-HPβCD and 2,6-DMβCD, but not in the other cyclodextrins. The favored inclusion formation of scandenin/2,6-DHPβCD occurred when the guest interpolated its hydroxyphenyl terminal into CD hydrophobic interior. Binding free energy calculation based on the MM-PBSA approach indicated that the modified βCDs (except for 2,6-DHPβCD) showed the stronger binding affinity to scandenin than did the parent host molecule. The results could help in selecting suitable βCD derivatives to enhance the stability of such guest molecules prior to in vitro testing."

Herein, we report a simple two-step surface modification method for commercially available PEDOT:PSS films printed on a flexible substrate. The derivatization process involves: (1) the introduction of an ethylenediamine linker for conjugation with the biorecognition element by activating the sulfonate group in PSS with an acid chloride reaction; and (2) the introduction of FPBA into the ethylenediamine linker. As a proof of concept, 4-carboxy-3-fluorophenylboronic acid (carboxy FPBA) is covalently introduced to the side chain of the PSS dopant in the conductive layer. FPBA serves as a selective molecular recognition element for diol compounds, including glucose, at neutral pH. Continuous glucose monitoring is achieved by label-free potentiometry using FPBA-functionalized commercial PEDOT:PSS films. Negative potential responses with glucose are successfully achieved in ideal and realistic buffer solutions with or without 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) because of the complexation of FPBA. The dynamic range of the enzyme-free sensor covered physiologically relevant blood glucose levels of 70–140 mg/dL. The developed method is suitable and cost effective for the mass production of biosensors as it can be applied to a large surface area at once. Furthermore, various ligands and receptors can be introduced onto commercial PEDOT:PSS films using this technique. Hence, the proposed method has potential applications in wearable and implantable biosensors."

Nevertheless, membrane fouling in AnMBRs has been a major concern. In this study, the surfaces of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes were modified with tannic acid (TA) and Cu(II) at various molar ratios of TA to Cu(II), including 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. The hydrophilicity, morphology, chemical structure, elemental composition, and antibacterial properties of the unmodified and modified membranes were analyzed using water contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), SEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX), and the clear zone method, respectively. The modified membrane with a TA-to-Cu(II) molar ratio of 1:3 had high hydrophilicity with certain antibacterial properties; therefore, it was selected to be further tested in an AnMBR along with an unmodified membrane. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of the unmodified membrane and modified membrane were 92.2 ± 3.6% and 91.8 ± 4.0%, respectively. The modified membrane had higher permeability after backwashing with less chemical cleaning (CC) than the unmodified membrane.

The elemental composition, phase structure, and morphology of the FB powder were investigated and compared with commercial hydroxyapatite powder (SM powder). The FB-powder exhibited 1.01 at. % of Mg while the SM-powder showed Mg in ppm-level. Carbonate groups were detected in the two powders. Both HAp and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) structures were found in the FB powder, but the SM powder exhibit only the HAp phase. Irregular-shaped particles were observed in the FB powder. After the two HAp powders were sintered at 1200 °C and 1250 °C for 2 h (FB-1200, FB-1250, SM-1200, and SM-1250), the β-TCP intensity peaks of the FB-ceramic samples significantly increased with increasing sintering temperature. The highest relative density, well-packed grains, and β-TCP stabilization by Mg at the Ca5 site of the FB-1250 structure were the dominant factors governing the highest mechanical properties. Although high density was observed in the SM-1200 sample, Vickers hardness of the SM-1200 sample is lower than the FB-1250 sample. This may be attributed to the partial decomposition of HAp into β-TCP, α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP), and Ca10(PO4)6O phases. In addition, the increase of grain size was the main factor that governs the increasing compressive strength and Young's modulus instead of density and phase decomposition of the SM-ceramic samples."

However, the projects have often failed to achieve positive public responses due to their unattractive and unkempt appearances. This study provides empirical insights into public perception of urban LID practices by studying user reactions to 16 sites located in the San Francisco Bay Area—eight with LID design and eight with conventional landscape design. Most of the 502 respondents, although expressing some misconceptions and limited stormwater knowledge, showed their appreciation and recognition of the LID landscapes. This finding implies that the implementation of new LID facilities can be continued and expanded without serious concern about strong public resistance, and suggests that the design of these existing LID sites can serve as models for the future projects in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with other urban areas. The study confirms the important role of picturesque beauty, naturalness, and neatness in satisfying public expectations, especially for aesthetic and ecological landscapes. Interestingly, interpretive signs appeared to be the preferable means for motivating stormwater education and the powerful means for producing positive public reactions to LID sites, suggesting the potential of urban LID projects as the venues for public education and outreach. The study not only emphasizes the alignment of aesthetics and ecology to enhance public satisfaction, but also promotes the aesthetic qualities and didactic opportunities as the essential components of LID implementation."

The mast structure is a basic aspect of the overhead line electrification equipment (OHLE) used in railway systems. This structure is very important as the failure of structure leads to the failure of an electric system that supplies the power to the train. To ensure structural safety and reliability, this paper thus analyses the reliability index of the mast, stay tube, and bracket tube structures. According to Eurocode, buckling resistance under compression of these parts were calculated based on specific material properties, and the load condition of these structures is based on Australian Railcorp document TMC331. In this paper, the strength load combination with the wind loading on the wire at 45° on the track is considered in particular as being the worst load combination for structures to bear, and the random variables used to affect reliability probabilistic analysis. Various parameters including self-weight, wind load, dimension parameters, materials, geometrical properties are taken into consideration. Statistical models of these parameters are taken from previous studies. The reliability index value was calculated via quantification of structure reliability using the first-order reliability method (FORM). Finally, a sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impacts of yield strength, length, cross-section, density, and load combination on reliability. The obtained results show that increasing length of structure can potentially reduce the reliability of mast structure to buckling resistance while the density of material also plays a major role in the reliability index. The findings will provide the structural safety criteria of the railway mast structure and improve the standard design to mitigate the risks and unplanned maintenance due to the uncertainties."

The potential health benefits of CQAs have been well-documented. While sprouts are widely recognized as health-promoting foods owing to their high phytonutrient content, our knowledge regarding the effect of cooking and storage, commonly practiced by consumers, on the CQA content remains limited. First, sunflower sprouts were found to have the highest total CQA content (~ 22 mg/g dry weight) out of 11 commonly available sprouts. Then, the effect of variety, cooking, and low-temperature storage on the CQA profile of sunflower sprouts was investigated. Among the four different varieties of sunflower sprouts, variety 1 harbored the highest total CQA content. Notably, cooking adversely affected the CQA content of sunflower sprouts relative to the uncooked samples in a time-dependent manner, possibly due to the heat sensitivity of CQAs. Under simulated home-refrigeration storage conditions, we observed a significant decline in the content of major CQA compounds (5-monoCQA and 3,5-diCQA) at days 10 and 13 of storage. The results obtained herein provide consumers and food industrialists with increased insight into the effect of cooking and refrigeration on the CQA content of sunflower sprouts."

However, the performance of hybrid supercapacitor is limited by the imbalance kinetics between the anode and cathode due to sluggish Faradic reaction of anode materials and less charge storage capacity of cathode materials. The design and development of lithium ion hybrid supercapacitor (LIC) can be possible by engineering anode, cathode and electrolyte materials. In this review, we focus on the evolution of anode materials for LICs fabrication. Different strategies to balance the kinetics between the cathode and the anode have already been reported, such as the engineering of novel materials and fabrication of different nanoarchitectures. LICs have been fabricated by tailoring different nanoarchitectures such as particles (0D), nanorods/nanowires/nanotubes (1D), thin sheets (2D) and hierarchical architectures (3D). The fabrication of nanostructured active materials with desired morphology (0D, 1D, 2D and 3D) and sizes with high aspect ratios facilitate fast lithium-ion insertion and extraction. The anode materials are divided into three types (i) lithium insertion reaction mechanism (ii) conversion reaction mechanism (iii) and the alloying reaction mechanism. The lithium insertion reaction-based materials have high stability whereas less capacity and energy density. In contrast to this, the conversion type electrodes have high energy density but low stability. Alloying type materials have ultra-high energy density while very low stability and reversibility. Hence, for getting high performance LIC all above mentioned aspects are required to be considered."

This research aims to design the conversion process of ethanol into a more versatile and valuable product, e.g., diethyl ether (DEE). To produce DEE, two types of ethanol can be utilized. Previously, the anhydrous ethanol was tested experimentally via catalytic dehydration on the Ru-HBZ catalyst. Satisfactory results were obtained, particularly acetaldehyde was not formed in the reaction. Herein, the catalytic experiment is extended using hydrous ethanol as feed resulting in an observable amount of acetaldehyde. These experimental results are implemented in the design of DEE production processes. Three production cases are investigated including the utilization of the anhydrous ethanol (Case I) and the utilization of the hydrous ethanol (Cases II and III). The most profitable process is obtained in Case I with the pay-out period of 4 years and % IRR (percentage of internal rate of return) of 55%. Acetaldehyde appears problematic in the DEE purification in Case II – the process is not profitable if distillation is selected for acetaldehyde removal. By implementing adsorption for the acetaldehyde removal, the process in Case III becomes profitable which is comparable to Case I. In addition, about a 5% reduction in the CO2 emission and a 7% gain in the energy utilization efficiency are observed in Case III. Finally, the utilization of hydrous ethanol (Case III) can be more attractive when the difference in selling prices of the hydrous and the anhydrous ethanols is more than 50%."

Field emission scanning electron microscope and Raman spectroscopy with a 532-nm laser wavelength were used to investigate the DI-water–exposed IrMn surface. The intensity of the Raman laser beam, varied from 0.05 to 50 mW, was carefully optimized to avoid laser-induced heat effects on the manganese oxide layer and IrMn thin film. The results showed that the laser-induced heat produced an α-Mn3O4 phase on the IrMn surface and a manganese oxide layer at 25 mW. Raman optimization was used to investigate the DI-water corrosion and manganese oxide structures on different areas of the IrMn surface."

Due to the worldwide agreement, the Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 has one of the priority actions to understand the risk before taking further steps to plan and operate. Furthermore, the knowledge of the emergency management has the topic of the critical infrastructure that needs to be protected to make it operate as usual during the emergency to prevent the worst case. The public healthcare system is one of these critical infrastructures. This research followed this concept and focused on the disaster problem in Thailand, which its major disaster type is a flood. The data from the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, Ministry of Interior, reported that during the fiscal year of 2010-2019, 48,543 THB of government expenditure on the emergency help cost was used to ease the flood disasters. Thus, this research paid attention to the development of the disaster risk profile in the public healthcare system during the flood situation. The study area was Nakhon Sawan Municipality, Nakhon Sawan Province, Thailand, one of the significantly affected areas from the 2011 Thailand floods. The main target referred to the operation during the 2011 floods in the study area. This research applied the!BPMN 2.0 to understand the operation process and the cooperation during the flood situation. The model could explain the function and responsibility of each organization and the disaster risk profile, by focusing on the operational level during the flood situation. The outcome of this was the risk profile and the suggestion to conduct the policy in the next step."

The arteries beneath the glabellar lines were investigated by meticulous dissections in 30 geriatric embalmed cadavers with latex injections into the arterial system. The results showed that the supratrochlear artery, a direct branch of the ophthalmic artery, ascended from the muscular layer of the medial eyebrow along the medial canthal vertical line of the intercanthal vertical zone (53 in 60 hemifaces, or 88%). The dominant single paracentral artery from the radix artery was found within the radix vertical zone (eight out of 30 glabellae, or 27%). Among these, the dominant paracentral artery was near the midline in two cadavers and arose along the radix vertical line in six cadavers. The dominant paracentral artery may be the cause of ocular complications during injections of glabellar lines between the medial eyebrows, especially at the radix vertical lines. The supratrochlear artery might cause ocular complications when an injection is performed close to the medial eyebrows. Pinching to create a skin crest and evert glabellar line for a precise injection is recommended to temporarily occludethe paracentral artery."

MIPs have been applied for chemical and biological templates due to properties such as chemical and thermal stability, high specificity, high selectivity, reusability, and reproducibility. These attractive properties have resulted in MIPs being considered materials for template separation and determination in complex samples. Water-soluble vitamins are important compounds that are involved in many metabolic processes to maintain body homeostasis. Insufficiency/deficiency of these vitamins, especially in underdeveloped/developing countries, leads to many health problems. In this review, we present the progression of each water-soluble vitamin imprinted polymer in terms of MIP-based extraction, magnetic MIP-based extraction and MIP-based sensors from 2001 to 2020.

All rights reserved.Objective:Sarcopenia is associated with high morbidity and mortality in older women. Early detection and intervention during the postmenopausal period were hypothesized to help maintain muscle mass and performance. Although the Asian Working Group has developed guidelines for sarcopenia management, the condition has not been sufficiently investigated in the middle-Aged cohort of the Asian population. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of pre-sarcopenia and sarcopenia in middle-Aged postmenopausal women and to determine the factors associated with low muscle mass.Methods:In this cross-sectional study conducted in the Menopause Clinic, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, we used the bioelectrical impedance analysis method to determine the appendicular muscle mass using a body composition analyzer (TANITA MC980 Plus). Appendicular muscle mass index, handgrip strength, and 6-m gait speed were measured in 340 women aged 45 to 65 years. Hormonal profiles, anthropometric data, and relevant history were recorded.Results:The mean age of the study participants and time since menopause were 57.8 ± 4.5 years and 9.4 ± 5.5 years, respectively. The proportion of pre-sarcopenic, sarcopenic, and nonsarcopenic women were 11.8%, 2.7%, and 85.6%, respectively. A body mass index ≤ 20 kg/m2had the strongest correlation with low muscle mass (odds ratio 7.1; 95% confidence interval 3.0-16.8, P < 0.001).Conclusion:Nearly 12% of Thai middle-Aged postmenopausal women were pre-sarcopenic.

Historical data in 2021 perform the Telescope problem that occurs when transporting ships for a long time and the cumulative heat is a catalyst of Telescoping. The Six Sigma approach was applied to improve the process under five phases (DMAIC) to remedy this problem. Therefore, the researcher studied the process, analyzed the results from the cause-and-effect matrix, analyzed the potential causes of issues, and FMEA prioritized the rationales to solve. The experiment results revealed that adjusting the adhesive thickness and nip-pressure in the coating process were causes of high winding tension and Telescoping. Moreover, ageing temperature and time before cutting into tape can inhibit Telescope movement. After improvement by adjusting parameters in the process, the height of the core is downshifted and is in the manufacturing standard. Besides, the process capability was improved to Cp = 2.14 and Cpk = 1.35, which passed the 1.33 acceptance criteria of the factory. As a result, the improvement can reduce the occurrence of Telescope tape from 40% to 0% of the current waste."

This so-called Macbeth effect demonstrated that washing one’s hands protected against physical contamination and also alleviated guilt after unethical behaviour. This moral cleansing behaviour retrieved moral self-worth as a means to take responsibility for past misdeeds and bridged the gap between moral self-concepts and perceived self-imagery as a counter-balance to elicit well-being. Extant research on moral cleansing presents a huge gap in the literature. A systematic review was undertaken to examine empirical studies that addressed the link between physical cleanliness and morality. Results showed that physical cleansing and the feeling of cleanliness have the capability to ameliorate one’s guilt after immoral behaviour, reduce prosocial behaviour by changing ethical standards and even promote a clean slate effect. However, failure studies of the Macbeth effect also exist due to disparities in culture, moral identity and methodological limitations. Future research scenarios are offered."

This procedure can reconstruct a 5-digit hand with stable thumb for opposition. As the viable epiphyseal plate is included in this transfer, the potential for future growth can be expected from this type of reconstruction. This article describes details of the surgical procedures. The outcomes of this reconstruction are shown in a 7-year-old girl who presented with hypoplastic thumb type IV. Initially, her thumb was unstable, nonmobile, and had no function. The skin pedicle of this thumb had a diameter of about 3 mm. Preoperative radiography showed floating thumb without first metacarpal bone. The vascularized metatarsophalangeal joint from the opposite second toe was used for her hypoplastic thumb reconstruction. During the procedure, the flail thumb was preserved. The intraoperative bone gap that was needed for reconstruction was 3.5 cm. The artery was anastomosed with common digital artery from the third web space. Two dorsal veins were joined with the subcutaneous vein at the dorsum of the hand. Total operative time was 6 hours.

To prevent salinity effects on rice yields, genetic diversity concerning salt tolerance must be evaluated. In this study, we investigated the salinity responses of rice (Oryza sativa) to determine the critical genes. The transcriptomes of ‘Luang Pratahn’ rice, a local Thai rice variety with high salt tolerance, were used as a model for analyzing and identifying the key genes responsible for salt-stress tolerance. Based on 3' Tag-Seq data from the time course of salt-stress treatment, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify key genes in gene modules. We obtained 1,386 significantly differentially expressed genes in eight modules. Among them, six modules indicated a significant correlation within 6, 12, or 48h after salt stress. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the co-expressed genes of interesting modules to reveal which genes were mainly enriched within important functions for salt-stress responses. To identify the key genes in salt-stress responses, we considered the two-state co-expression networks, normal growth conditions, and salt stress to investigate which genes were less important in a normal situation but gained more impact under stress. We identified key genes for the response to biotic and abiotic stimuli and tolerance to salt stress. Thus, these novel genes may play important roles in salinity tolerance and serve as potential biomarkers to improve salt tolerance cultivars."

Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Purpose Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor approved for stroke prophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Real-world data about patient preference, satisfaction and convenience in patients in Asia are not available. The study aimed to explore the perception of patients with newly diagnosed NVAF regarding dabigatran versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), when used for stroke prevention. Patients and methods This was a multinational, multicentre, non-interventional study involving 49 sites across 5 countries in South East Asia and South Korea where 934 patients newly diagnosed with NVAF were initiated on either dabigatran (N=591) or VKA (N=343). Data were collected at baseline and over two follow-up visits across 6 months. Treatment satisfaction and patient convenience were evaluated using the Perception on Anticoagulant Treatment Questionnaire-2 (PACT-Q2). Results The mean age of the patients was 65.9±10.4 years, and 64.2% were male. Mean CHA 2 DS 2-VASc score was 2.4±1.5, and mean HAS-BLED score was 1.2±0.9. At baseline, patients initiated on dabigatran had higher stroke risk, bleeding risk, creatinine clearance and proportion of patients with concomitant illnesses compared with patients initiated on VKAs. Treatment convenience was perceived to be significantly better with dabigatran versus VKAs at visits 2 and 3 (p=0.0423 and 0.0287, respectively). Treatment satisfaction was significantly better with dabigatran compared with VKAs at visit 3 (p=0.0300). Conclusion In this study, dabigatran is associated with better patient perception in terms of treatment convenience and satisfaction compared with VKAs when used for stroke prevention in newly diagnosed NVAF patients from South East Asia and South Korea. Plain language summary Patient satisfaction with dabigatran versus VKAs in South East Asia. Patients with atrial fibrillation are at high risk of stroke and require anticoagulants for stroke prevention. Two such anticoagulants are dabigatran and VKAs. We wanted to compare the extent of satisfaction and treatment convenience among newly diagnosed patients with atrial fibrillation from the South East Asian region when they were given either dabigatran or VKAs. Consenting patients filled out a standardised questionnaire called the PACT-Q2 over three visits after they were started on either dabigatran (591 patients) or VKAs (343 patients). We found that satisfaction and convenience were significantly higher when patients received dabigatran than when they received VKAs."

Data of Landrace (LR), Large White (LW) and Duroc (DR) sows from one nucleus farm were analyzed. Data used in this study were 28,809 records of sows farrowing during 2006 to 2019. The factors effecting traits were examined by using GLM procedure in SAS program. Variance and covariance components were estimated using AIREMLF90 program. The model was applied with fixed effects for contemporary group, breed and parity, and random effects for animal, permanent environmental effect and residual effect. Heritabilities ranged from 0.26 to 0.32, 0.05 to 0.13, 0.07 to 0.12 and 0.01 to 0.03 for GL, TB, BA and SB, respectively. Genetic correlations between TB and BA were high (0.99) in all breeds. Genetic correlations of GL with TB and BA were negative. Genetic correlations between TB, BA and SB were positive. All the results suggest that selection for larger TB will increase BA and SB in LR and DR as well as decrease GL in DR. However, in LR and LW, selection for larger TB would probably result in a correlated decrease in GL. In regards to the positive genetic correlation between TB and SB, piglet mortality should be considered as a selection criterion to improve piglet survival.

The dog has a history of an internal implant fixation for the right femoral fracture at 5 months ago. Physical examination revealed a dome shape, hard consistency, non-movable, painless, subcutaneous mass with size 5x6 cm. Radiography and ultrasonography showed a well-circumscribed, calcified soft tissue mass at craniolateral aspect of the right proximal femur without cortical bone reaction. Computed tomography (CT) scan was not performed in this case because metal fixation was implanted at the right femur. Cytology was obtained by the fine needle aspiration which revealed numerous transplant unstained granular crystals material with few neutrophils and macrophage. Whereas blood profile revealed normal ranges of serum calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels. Surgical excision was subsequently done to remove the calcified mass. On the gross, cross section of the calcified mass revealed variable sizes of chalky-like appearance that accumulated in the dermis and epidermis.

All rights reserved.Small-scale commercial chicken farming represents an important source of income to rural households in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. A wide range of vaccines are currently administered to flocks, but is not based on empirical knowledge on pathogen circulation. We collected serum samples and vaccination data from a random sample of 267 small-scale native chicken flocks in Dong Thap to determine serological profiles by ELISA against 8 pathogens: Avian Influenza (AI), Chicken Anaemia virus (CAV), Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) virus, Infectious Bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle Disease virus (NDV), O. rhinotracheale (ORT), P. multocida (PM) and M. gallisepticum (MG). The aims were: (1) to describe the vaccines used; (2) to investigate the relationship between titres and vaccination status; and (3) to identify diseases most likely to be circulating in the area by investigating the seroprevalence in unvaccinated flocks. A total of 33 commercial vaccines against 6 different pathogens had been used, and flocks had been vaccinated against a median of 4 [IQR 3-5] pathogens each. In decreasing order, the highest titres among unvaccinated flocks corresponded to CAV (97.0%), followed by IBD (88.6%), IBV (66.5%), ORT (56.9%), NDV (45.5%), MG (50.9%), AI (21.4%) and PM (2.7%). Given the frequency of clinical cases confirmed in diagnostic laboratory, results support maintaining vaccination programmes against IBD, IBV, NDV and AI. Since MG is commonly detected, inclusion of vaccination against MG is recommended. Ongoing serological monitoring of chicken flock should be carried in conjunction with vaccination data in order to adapt disease control measures to circulating pathogens."

In addition to traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, antiretroviral therapy, lifestyle, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related factors may contribute to future CV events in persons with HIV (PWH). Methods. Among participants in the global REPRIEVE randomized trial, we characterized demographics and HIV characteristics relative to ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations (PCE) for atherosclerotic CV disease predicted risk and CV health evaluated by Life’s Simple 7 (LS7; includes smoking, diet, physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and glucose). Results. Among 7382 REPRIEVE participants (31% women, 45% Black), the median PCE risk score was 4.5% (lower and upper quartiles Q1, Q3: 2.2, 7.2); 29% had a PCE score <2.5%, and 9% scored above 10%. PCE score was related closely to known CV risk factors and modestly (<1% difference in risk score) to immune function and HIV parameters. The median LS7 score was 9 (Q1, Q3: 7, 10) of a possible 14. Only 24 participants (0.3%) had 7/7 ideal components, and 36% had ≤2 ideal components; 90% had <5 ideal components. The distribution of LS7 did not vary by age or natal sex, although ideal health was more common in low sociodemographic index countries and among Asians. Poor dietary and physical activity patterns on LS7 were seen across all PCE scores, including the lowest risk categories. Conclusions. Poor CV health by LS7 was common among REPRIEVE participants, regardless of PCE. This suggests a critical and independent role for lifestyle interventions in conjunction with conventional treatment to improve CV outcomes in PWH."

Specimens from the Andaman islands form a mixed clade together with individuals from the mainland and differ from the latter by genetic distances of 0.2–0.5% (except for 1.7% from a single mainland specimen that also differs from other mainland samples of F. piscator by 1.4–1.5% genetic distance). The genetic distances between individuals of F. piscator and its supposed sister taxon F. flavipunctatus vary from 4.8 to 7.3%. In pholidosis, F. tytleri and F. piscator are essentially identical. Based on the evidence from mtDNA and morphological data (the latter taken from the literature), we formally place Fowlea tytleri (Blyth, 1863) in the synonymy of F. piscator (Schneider, 1799)."

The turtle is well adapted to agricultural areas, making them vulnerable to population decline as their nesting grounds are not in protected areas. This study aimed to examine the nesting ecology and estimated number of reproductive females. Nests of M. macrocephala were surveyed in a 16-hectare rice field at central Thailand. Turtle nests were searched for and monitored on two consecutive days per fortnight during December 2013 to May 2014. The nesting season of M. macrocephala in this area was from early December to early April. A total of 74 clutches of 3–9 eggs each were found in this area. Turtle nests were covered by ground vegetation and mainly found on the rice-field ridge with the distance less than 5 m from the water source. All the turtle eggs were collected for incubation at the laboratory until hatching. In addition, adult turtles were trapped by mesh traps placed in canals within the study area. Mitochondrial DNA samples of juvenile turtles and trapped adult females were analyzed for haplotype variation in the cytochrome b gene. From 71 clutches and six adult females found within this study period, seven haplotypes were found. This indicates that seven or more females reproduced. Given the assumption that a reproductive female lays only one clutch per night, eggs with the same haplotype in multiple new nests in one night were laid by different females. Based on this, our field records of newly formed nests revealed that at least 10 different females reproduced in this 16-hectare area. Our results show that combining field and molecular techniques allows for determining a minimum number of female turtles that reproduce in a particular area, which is useful for conservation planning in the future."

Here we analyse environmental DNA from microbial communities preserved in known tsunami and storm-deposited sediments and intercalating soils and non-marine sediments near Cuddalore, India, and Phra Thong Island, Thailand. Both sites were impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and a subsequent storm flooding event (2011 Cyclone Thane at Cuddalore and a 2007 storm at Phra Thong Island). We show that the microbial communities in the overwash deposits are significantly different from soil and sediments that are not derived by overwash processes at both locations. Our method also successfully discriminates between modern tsunami deposits and storm deposits. We suggest molecular techniques have the potential to accurately discriminate overwash deposits from catastrophic natural events."

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), production and hosting by Kasetsart University of Research and Development Institute on behalf of Kasetsart University.Palmitoleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid that has been shown to have many important health benefits, with broad applications in medicines and cosmetics. Intracellular oils accumulated in yeast cells are mostly in the form of triacylglycerols, of which some are contain palmitoleic acid. This work investigated oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) as a potential feedstock for the production of oils with a high palmitoleic acid content using Cyberlindnera subsufficiens NG8.2. The low sugar concentration of the OPEFB hydrolysate (OPEFBH) was overcome by the co-utilization of cassava starch hydrolysate (CSH). The maximum oil titer of Cy. subsufficiens NG8.2 at 30°C was almost the same in a mixture of either OPEFBH plus CSH (OPEFBH-CSH) or OPEFBH plus glucose (OPEFBH-G) at the same final glucose concentration (50 g/L). However, the oil produced using OPEFBH-CSH contained a higher palmitoleic acid content (18.51% weight per weight, w/w) than from OPEFBH-G (10.41%, w/w). Supplementation of OPEFBH-CSH with 1 g/L KH2PO4, 0.05 g/L MgSO4∙7H2O and 0.01 g/L CaCl2∙2H2O (pH 5.0) increased the oil titer from 1.17 g/L to 1.96 g/L. Reducing the incubation temperature from 30°C to 25°C increased the palmitoleic acid content from 18.03% (w/w) to 21.49% (w/w) without any significant effects on the oil titer and oil composition."
"['Geography, Planning and Development', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","The origins of the Cold War in Southeast Asia: Pre-Second World War Siamese cooperation with foreign powers against communism Copyright  The National University of Singapore, 2022.The origins of the Cold War in Southeast Asia are most often located in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, in the late 1940s. Historians sometimes trace its origins to Japan's expansionist phase in the 1930s, which accelerated the decline of the European and American colonial order in this part of Asia. However, the necessity of the fight against communism appeared very clearly in the minds of the leaders of the major colonial powers well before the 1930s. Focused on the case of Siam, this article aims to show that the origins of the Cold War in Southeast Asia dated back to as early as the 1920s with the emergence of international cooperation in the fight against communism and the Thai elite's manipulation of imperialist powers to further their own political agenda and support their dominance in the domestic political arena. The Cold War in Southeast Asia was not only about the postwar fight against the spread of communism, but also closely intertwined with the decolonisation and nation-building efforts of every country in the region-including of the so-called un-colonised Thailand."
['Veterinary (all)'],"Development of multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for differentiation of strains of infectious bursal disease virus and primary screening of the virus in Thailand  2021 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.Background and Aim: A new set of primers (400 base pairs partial of VP2) was designed and used for the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) screening test. Using this new primer set, the enzymes MboI and BstNI were unable to differentiate the field and vaccine strains. As a result, a new simple, cheap, and appropriate tool for strain differentiation is required. The objective of this study was to develop the appropriate restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the differentiation of classic IBDV (cIBDV) strains and very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strains in Thailand. Materials and Methods: Ninety seven bursa of Fabricius from 16 farms were collected from farms in the eastern and central regions of Thailand. RT-PCR screening showed that 82 samples were positive for IBDV and 15 samples were negative. Then, selected samples were sequenced from each farm with a positive test. Results: The sequencing results showed that samples from six of the farms were vvIBDV and samples from the other six farms were cIBDV. Although the whole genome sequencing was incomplete, both the sequencing results of segment A and segment B showed high similarity between cIBDV and vvIBDV. Restriction enzyme cutting site and primers for multiplex RT-PCR were hard to design. An RT-PCR-RFLP method was developed, but it failed to differentiate IBDV strains. However, the multiplex RT-PCR was able to differentiate cIBDV from vvIBDV. Four primers were used in the multiplex RT-PCR. Conclusion: These four primers were used together in one reaction at an annealing temperature of 45°C. Therefore, multiplex RT-PCR is a less complicated, cheaper, and less time-consuming method for the differentiation of cIBDV and vvIBDV strains."

IgG levels vary depending on several factors, including breed, disease status, colostrum management, handling, and collection time postpartum. A handheld optical refractometer, an affordable instrument that is simple to use in the field, is used widely in dairy farms to measure total solids. However, it can also be applied to estimate colostrum IgG content on the basis of comparison with standard measurement methods, usually radial immunodiffusion. Studies comparing %Brix values in relation to IgG concentration measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in goats are limited. The present study aimed to evaluate the use of a handheld optical Brix refractometer for the measurement of IgG concentration in goat colostrum, compare results with those using ELISA, and estimate the %Brix cutoff value equating to low-quality colostrum. Materials and Methods: Colostrum samples were collected on day 0 from 21 goats (nine Black Bengal, six Saanen, and six of their crossbred offspring) and were frozen. Subsequently, they were analyzed for IgG concentration using a goat-specific ELISA test and Brix percentage using a handheld refractometer. The optimum %Brix cutoff value for the evaluation of colostrum quality was evaluated. Results: The mean IgG concentration and %Brix in colostrum were 10.60±2.92 mg/mL and 25.0±3.9, respectively. There was a significant (p<0.01) correlation between %Brix and IgG concentration. For an IgG concentration of 6.9 mg/dL, the cutoff value for %Brix was 18.5, equating to high specificity (100%) but low sensitivity (50%). A higher %Brix cutoff value of 21.5 showed high specificity (95%) and high sensitivity (100%). Conclusion: A Brix refractometer can be used to estimate goat colostrum quality with a proposed %Brix cutoff value of <18.5%-21.5% for poor-quality colostrum."

Upfront systemic treatment followed by surgery and radiation therapy or ""Tri-modality"" treatment is a standard of care for newly diagnosed IBC. Due to its rarity, the data of systemic treatment for IBC has been extrapolated mostly from non-IBC clinical trials. Methods: We summarized the recent data of systemic treatment stratified by concerning topics and breast cancer subtypes. Some topics are less likely to have strong data from IBC clinical trial to supports. Therefore, we interpolate the non-IBC data to support our review.

A fourth-order nonlocal strain gradient model based on a thermodynamic approach is employed to represent the small-scale effect (nonlocal effect) while the Gurtin-Murdoch continuum model based on the surface elastic theory is used to account for the size-dependent effect (surface energy effect). The proposed model is derived from the virtual displacement principle, leading to the governing differential equations and its associated natural boundary conditions. The analytical solutions of the sixth-order governing differential equation for the nanowire-substrate element are provided, and were employed in numerical simulations. Two numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the performance and to investigate the characteristics of the fourth-order nonlocal strain gradient model on nanowire responses, when compared to the classical model and the second-order nonlocal strain gradient model. The first simulation investigates the influences of nonlocal and surface effects on the responses of a nanowire embedded in an elastic substrate, while the second simulation study assessed the sensitivity of system stiffness on parameters in the nanowire-substrate model."

Methods: EDI-OCT images of eyes with active and quiescent intermediate uveitis were retrospectively reviewed and binarized using ImageJ software. Choroidal parameters including CVI, total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA), and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) were measured and compared between baseline and follow-up visits among eyes with active and quiescent intermediate uveitis. Results: Thirty-eight eyes from 21 patients with active intermediate uveitis and 30 eyes from 17 patients with quiescent intermediate uveitis were included. CVI in eyes with active intermediate uveitis significantly increased from baseline (66.50% ± 3.40%) with resolution of inflammation on follow-up (68.82%±3.90%; P<0.001). In eyes with quiescent intermediate uveitis at baseline eyes, CVI did not significantly change after follow-up (66.34% ± 3.19% to 66.25% ± 3.13%; P = 0.850). Conclusions: CVI significantly increased when active inflammation in intermediate uveitis resolved while CVI remained unchanged at follow-up in quiescent intermediate uveitis.

The measurements are performed in a fiducial volume defined at the particle level. Events with an isolated, highly energetic lepton, at least three jets from the hadronization of quarks, among which at least one is b tagged, and one isolated photon are selected. The inclusive fiducial tt ¯ γ cross section, for a photon with transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV and pseudorapidity |η| < 1.4442, is measured to be 798 ± 7(stat) ± 48(syst) fb, in good agreement with the prediction from the standard model at next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics. The differential cross sections are also measured as a function of several kinematic observables and interpreted in the framework of the standard model effective field theory (EFT), leading to the most stringent direct limits to date on anomalous electromagnetic dipole moment interactions of the top quark and the photon.

BRII-179 induced anti-HBs responses in >30% patients in all treatment cohorts, however, moderate anti-Pre-S1 or anti-Pre-S2 antibody responses were only observed in patients receiving BRII-179 with IFN-α. BRII-179 also restored S-, Pre-S1-, Pre-S2-specific IFN-γ-producing T-cells in the majority of treated patients. Overall, no notable reduction of HBsAg was observed after BRII-179 treatment. Conclusion: In patients with CHB under NA therapy, BRII-179 with/without IFN-α exhibited a good safety profile and induced HBV-specific B- and T-cell immune responses. These data support further clinical evaluation of BRII-179 in combination with other therapies. Clinical Trial Number: ACTRN12619001210167 Lay summary: BRII-179 is a therapeutic vaccine designed to improve the immune response in patients with chronic hepatitis B. In this study, BRII-179 alone or with a low dose of interferon-α was safe, well tolerated, and induced enhanced HBV-specific antibody and T-cell responses in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, BRII-179 treatment alone had minimal effect on patient's virological status. The potential of BRII-179 to achieve a functional cure in conjunction with other agents is being evaluated in the clinic."
"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)']","Research priorities for an HIV cure: International AIDS Society Global Scientific Strategy 2021  2021, Springer Nature America, Inc.Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV, lifelong treatment is required and there is no cure. HIV can integrate in the host genome and persist for the life span of the infected cell. These latently infected cells are not recognized as foreign because they are largely transcriptionally silent, but contain replication-competent virus that drives resurgence of the infection once ART is stopped. With a combination of immune activators, neutralizing antibodies, and therapeutic vaccines, some nonhuman primate models have been cured, providing optimism for these approaches now being evaluated in human clinical trials. In vivo delivery of gene-editing tools to either target the virus, boost immunity or protect cells from infection, also holds promise for future HIV cure strategies. In this Review, we discuss advances related to HIV cure in the last 5 years, highlight remaining knowledge gaps and identify priority areas for research for the next 5 years."

Then, the raw materials were sulfonated and further activated by a microwave-induced reactor. Characteristics of sulfonated oil palm kernel shell (OPS-AC), corncob (CK-AC), and diatomaceous earth (DE-AC) were analysed using FTIR, XPS, NH3-TPD, XRD, SEM, BET, and TGA to establish their physical and chemical properties. The CK-AC and DE-AC showed high potential to be used as solid acid catalysts consisting of the strong acid site (-SO3H and -COOH) with 2344 and 3098 μmol/g for CK-AC and DE-AC, respectively. The DE-AC exhibited better thermal stability by only 7% of mass loss observed. The ester yields of 54.2 and 60.4% were achieved over CK-AC and DE-AC, respectively. Moreover, DE-AC shows the outstanding reusability for five successive times, which is promising as the potential solid catalysts for ethyl propanoate production."

In many constructions, the top cement surface is coated with a stucco system. In this study, we present experimental results on the corrosion behavior of a rapid-set stucco composite consisting of calcium sulfoaluminate cement (CSA). The rapid-set stucco is a new product on the market and was designed to improve the practicality of stucco use, which typically requires three coatings. Our test results indicate that the structure is not influenced by the fine aggregate (FA) content but is affected by the water-to-cement (w/c) ratio. The w/c ratio affects the apparent diffusivity (Da) of chloride ions penetrating the structure. The pH results indicate that the passivation layer is not formed, leaving a doubt that the CSA stucco should be in use, especially for non-galvanized steel reinforced system. To reduce the negative effect of absence of passivation layer, uniform mixing and casting mixture having good workability is needed which can prolong its serviceability up to 3 times. The use of galvanized steel is also essential which can be increase its service life for at least 5 to 10 times. This is because zinc layer from galvanization process also greatly decreases the corrosion rate by 475% less than that of steel layer itself."

Before a computed tomography (CT) scanner can be used in clinical practice, it must pass a quality assurance process. Objective: To assess the performance of MobiiScan before it can be further evaluated in human subjects. Materials and Methods: Images from scanning of an imaging phantom by MobiiScan were compared to a commercial 64-slice (GE Discovery CT750 HD) and a mobile (Neurologica CereTom) CT scanner, which were used as controls. Spatial resolution, uniformity, noise, accuracy of CT number, and geometric accuracy were examined by three investigators. Results: According to the bone scanning protocol, spatial resolution of the images produced by MobiiScan was comparable to the mobile scanner, but it was less than the 64-slice scanner. In addition, the signal uniformity of MobiiScan was poorer compared to the controls. MobiiScan produced more noise than the mobile and the 64-slice scanners at the 120-kVp mode, but less noise than the 64-slice scanner at the 80-kVp mode. Using the brain protocol, the spatial resolution from the MobiiScan was higher than the mobile scanner, but comparable to the 64-slice scanner. Although the signal uniformity of the MobiiScan was superior compared to the controls, the noise production was more than the controls. At all settings, the MobiiScan gave underrated distances and inaccurate CT numbers. However, it delivered very low radiation doses. Conclusion: MobiiScan had a good spatial resolution and delivered low radiation dose, which suggested that it could be used for bone examination as intended by the creator. However, its noise production and inaccurate CT numbers suggest that MobiiScan should not be used to diagnose soft tissue problems. It is recommended that the hardware and software should be adjusted to provide a better signal uniformity, lower noise level, accurate CT number, and geometric accuracy."

However, their knowledge, attitudes, and practices may be influenced by certain cultures and beliefs. This study explored the factors associated with the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among the Muslim army conscript in three deep southern provinces of Thailand. Methods: The cross-sectional study design was conducted among 360 Muslim army conscripts. A researcher made questionnaire on knowledge of HIV/STI transmission, attitude toward condom use, and sexual behavior was distributed to the participants in a camp base. The association between the potential predictor variables and the risk of HIV/STI was analyzed using the multiple logistic regression. Statistically significant of the association considered a P value ≤ 0.05. Results: The results suggest that most Muslim army conscripts had a poor knowledge level of HIV/STI transmission (78.7%) and that their attitude toward condom use was at a moderate level (60.0%). The predicted factors were marital status [aOR = 0.078, 95% CI = 0.035-0.172], substance use before having sex [aOR = 8.044, 95% CI = 1.288-50.230], stimulant use before having sex [aOR = 3.632, 95% CI = 1.080-12.211], vaginal sexual intercourse [aOR = 26.228, 95% CI = 8.370-82.189], and oral sexual intercourse [aOR = 2.256, 95% CI = 1.106-4.601].

['Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine'],"The analgesic efficacy of anterior femoral cutaneous nerve block in combination with femoral triangle block in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial  The Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2021.Background: Ultrasound-guided femoral triangle block (FTB) can provide motor-sparing anterior knee analgesia. However, it may not completely anesthetize the anterior femoral cutaneous nerve (AFCN). We hypothesized that an AFCN block (AFCNB) in combination with an FTB would decrease pain during movement in the immediate 12 h postoperative period compared with an FTB alone. Methods: Eighty patients scheduled to undergo total knee arthroplasty were randomized to receive either FTB alone (FTB group) or AFCNB with FTB (AFCNB + FTB group) as part of the multimodal analgesic regimen. The primary outcome was pain during movement at 12 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, incidence of surgical incision site pain, intravenous morphine consumption, immediate functional performance, patient satisfaction, and length of hospital stay. Results: The NRS pain scores on movement 12 h postoperatively were significantly lower in the AFCNB + FTB group than in the FTB group (mean difference: –2.02, 95% CI: –3.14, –0.89, P < 0.001). The incidence of pain at the surgical incision site at 24 h postoperatively and morphine consumption within 48 h postoperatively were significantly lower (P < 0.001), and quadriceps muscle strength at 0° immediately after surgery was significantly greater in the AFCNB + FTB group (P = 0.04). Conclusions: The addition of ultrasound-guided AFCNB to FTB provided more effective analgesia and decreased opioid requirement compared to FTB alone after total knee arthroplasty and may enhance immediate functional performance on the day of surgery."

Methods: A 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up was conducted in 193 healthy but high-risk office workers. Participants in the intervention groups received custom-designed apparatus to facilitate either active breaks or postural shifts to reduce sitting discomfort at work. Participants in a control group received a placebo seat pad. Incidence of neck and low back pain with pain intensity and disability level was recorded monthly. Main outcome measures were recovery time and recurrent rate of neck and low back pain. Analyses were performed using log rank test and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Median time to recovery in those receiving active break and postural shift interventions (1 month) was significantly shorter than those in the control group (2 months). Neck and low back pain recurrent rates for the active break, postural shift, and control groups were 21%, 18%, and 44%, respectively. Hazard rate (HR) ratios after adjusting for biopsychosocial factors indicated a protective effect of active break and postural shift interventions for neck and low back pain recurrence (HRadj 0.22, 95% CI 0.06–0.83 for active breaks and HRadj 0.35, 95% CI 0.16–0.77 for postural shift).

A distinct empirical phenomenon, mass atrocities are events of enormous scale, severity, and brutality, occur in wartime and in peacetime, are geographically widespread, occur with surprising frequency, under various systems of governance, and can be long-lasting in their effects on economic and human development, wellbeing, and wealth, more so when nonfatal physical injuries and mental trauma also are considered. As such, mass atrocities are a major economic concern. Given the multidisciplinary nature of the subject matter, the pertinent conceptual, theoretical, and empirical literatures are voluminous and widely dispersed, and have not been synthesized before from an economics point of view. We address two gaps: a “mass atrocities gap” in the economics literature and an “economics gap” in mass atrocities scholarship. Our goals are, first, to survey and synthesize for economists a broad sweep of literatures on which to base further work in this field and, second, for both economists and noneconomists to learn how economic inquiry contributes to understanding the causes and conduct of mass atrocities and, possibly, to their mitigation and prevention. In drawing on standard, behavioral, identity, social network, and complex systems economics, we find that the big puzzles of the “how” and “why” of mass atrocities, and mass participation therein, are being well addressed.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Despite our ageing populations, elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical research, and ageing research is often separate from that of Parkinson's disease (PD). To our knowledge, no previous study has focused on the most elderly ('old-old', age ≥ 85 years) patients with PD to reveal how age directly influences PD clinical progression. Objective We compared the clinical characteristics and pharmacological profiles, including complications of levodopa treatment, disease progression, disabilities, and comorbidities of the oldold with those of comparable younger ('young-old', age 60-75 years) PD patients. In addition, within the old-old group, we compared those with a short disease duration (< 10 years at the time of diagnosis) to those with a long disease duration ≥10 years to investigate whether prognosis was related to disease progression or aging. Methods This single-centre, case-control study compared 60 old-old to 92 young-old PD patients, matched for disease duration. Patients in the old-old group were also divided equally (30:30) into two subgroups (short and long disease duration) with the same mean age. We compared the groups based on several clinical measures using a conditional logistic regression. Results By study design, there were no differences between age groups when comparing disease duration, however, the proportion of men decreased with age (p = 0.002). At a comparable length of PD duration of 10 years, the old-old PD patients predominantly had significantly greater postural instability and gait disturbance (p = 0.006), higher motor scope of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III, p<0.0001), and more advanced Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage (p<0.0001). The Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest) score was also significantly higher among the old-old (p<0.0001) compared to the young-old patients. Moreover, the distribution of NMS also differed between ages, with features of gastrointestinal problems (p<0.0001), urinary problems (p = 0.004), sleep disturbances and fatigue (p = 0.032), and cognitive impairment (p<0.0001) significantly more common in the old-old group, whereas sexual problems (p = 0.012), depression, and anxiety (p = 0.032) were more common in the young-old. No differences were found in visual hallucinations, cerebrovascular disease, and miscellaneous domains. While young-old PD patients received higher levodopa equivalent daily doses (p<0.0001) and developed a significant greater rate of dyskinesia (p = 0.002), no significant difference was observed in the rate of wearing-off (p = 0.378). Old-old patients also had greater disability, as measured by the Schwab and England scale (p<0.0001) and had greater milestone frequency specifically for dementia (p<0.0001), wheelchair placement (p<0.0001), nursing home placement (p = 0.019), and hospitalisation in the past 1 year (p = 0.05). Neither recurrent falls (p = 0.443) nor visual hallucinations (p = 0.607) were documented significantly more often in the old-old patients. Conclusions Age and disease duration were independently associated with clinical presentation, course, and progression of PD. Age was the main predictor, but disease duration also had a strong effect, suggesting that factors of the ageing process beyond the disease process itself cause PD in the most elderly to be more severe."

In several cases, the implementation of agroecological practices has grown beyond isolated, local experiences to be employed by ever-greater numbers of families and communities over ever-larger territories and to engage more people in the processing, distribution, and consumption of agroecologically produced food. To understand the nonlinear, multidimensional processes that have enabled and impelled the bringing to scale of agroecology, we review and analyze emblematic cases that include the farmer-to-farmer movement in Central America; the national peasant agroecology movement in Cuba; the organic coffee boom in Chiapas, Mexico; the spread of Zero Budget Natural Farming in Karnataka, India; and the agroecological farmer-consumer marketing network “Rede Ecovida,” in Brazil. Based on our analysis, we identify eight key drivers of the process of taking agroecology to scale: 1) recognition of a crisis that motivates the search for alternatives; 2) social organization; 3) constructivist learning processes; 4) effective agroecological practices; 5) mobilizing discourses; 6) external allies; 7) favorable markets, and 8) favorable policies. This initial analysis shows that organization and social fabric are the growth media on which agroecology advances, with the help of the other drivers.

Several reports have suggested that biting midges might be a potential vector of Leishmania parasites. In this study, we screened for Leishmania and Trypanosoma DNA in biting midges collected from near the home of a leishmaniasis patient in Lamphun province, northern Thailand by using UV-CDC light traps. The identification of biting midge species was based on morphological characters and confirmed using the Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The detection of Leishmania and Trypanosoma DNA was performed by amplifying the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes, respectively. All the amplified PCR amplicons were cloned and sequenced. The collected 223 biting midges belonged to seven species (Culicoides mahasarakhamense, C. guttifer, C. innoxius, C. sumatrae, C. huffi, C. oxystoma, and C. palpifer). The dominant species found in this study was C. mahasarakhamense (47.53%). Leishmania martiniquensis DNA was detected in three samples of 106 specimens of C. mahasarakhamense tested indicating a field infection rate of 2.83%, which is comparable to reported rates in local phlebotomines. Moreover, we also detected Trypanosoma sp. DNA in one sample of C. huffi. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular detection of L. martiniquensis in C. mahasarakhamense as well as the first detection of avian Trypanosoma in C. huffi. Blood meal analysis of engorged specimens of C. mahasarakhamense, C. guttifer, and C. huffi revealed that all specimens had fed on avian, however, further studies of the host ranges of Culicoides are needed to gain a better insight of potential vectors of emerging leishmaniasis.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Lung cancer is recognized as a major cause of mortality worldwide owing to its metastatic activity. Given the lack of solid information regarding the possible effects of caffeine, one of the most consumed natural psychoactive substances, on molecular signaling pathways implicated in the aggressive behavior of lung cancer, our study aimed to evaluate the effect and mechanism of caffeine on metastasis-related mechanisms. The results revealed that caffeine treatment at concentrations of 0-500 μM caused no direct cytotoxic effects on NCI-H23 cells. Treatment of cells with caffeine showed good potential to inhibit cell proliferation at 48 h and induced significant cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Concerning metastasis, caffeine was shown to reduce filopodia formation, inhibit migration and invasion capability, and reduce the ability of cancer cells to survive and grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Moreover, caffeine could attenuate the formation of 3D tumor spheroids in cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched populations. With regard to mechanisms, we found that caffeine significantly altered the integrin pattern of the treated cells and caused the downregulation of metastasis-associated integrins, namely, integrins αv and β3. Subsequently, the downstream signals, including protein signaling and transcription factors, namely, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), and c-Myc, were significantly decreased in caffeine-exposed cells. Taken together, our novel data on caffeine-inhibiting mechanism in relation to metastasis in lung cancer could provide insights into the impact of caffeine intake on human diseases and conditions."

All rights reserved.This research aimed to analyze the relationship of the defense, conservation, and recovery of seeds with the scaling of agroecology. Through a qualitative case study design, information was collected from two local organizations in Colombia: Custodios de Semillas de Riosucio (department of Caldas) and the Red Agroecológica del Caribe or RECAR (departments of Córdoba and Sucre), both belong to the Network of Free Seeds of Colombia (RSLC). The field work was carried out between 2016 and 2017, semi-structured interviews and focus groups were carried out with seed custodians, community leaders and specialists on the subject. Some findings indicate that in the processes of conservation, recovery and defense of creole and native seeds, two types of agroecology escalation are established: One horizontal, due to the activities that link the knowledge, principles, and practices between the custodians of seeds, their communities, the organizations, and networks in which they participate. Another is a deep escalation, which is given by 1) the custody of seeds that generates and/or reaffirms indigenous and peasant identities in their vital spaces; 2) because these processes of conservation, recovery and defense of seeds make up a multidimensional process both technically, politically and symbolically that provides cultural and territorial roots (seen as cultural revaluation, ecological regeneration and a political-economic repositioning), and 3) the strengthening of the social-organizational fabric through the collective actions and strategies carried out in their territories for the defense of native and creole seeds. These processes provide the conditions for the scaling of agroecology and contribute to the construction of seed sovereignty, which is an essential aspect in the struggle to preserve and reproduce native and creole seeds."

All rights reserved.Actinobacteria are a promising source of novel antibiotics. The study of diverse actinobacteria from Sichang Island may lead to a discovery of new microbes with pharmaceutical applications. Some actinobacteria, especially those in the genus Nocardia, can cause infection in humans and animals. A total of 55 actinobacteria were isolated from six soil samples collected from Sichang Island, Chonburi Province, Thailand. Based on the morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene analysis, the actinobacterial isolates were classified into three genera including Streptomyces (32 isolates), Nocardia (22 isolates), and Saccharothrix (1 isolate). Most of the Streptomyces and the Saccharothrix isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity, with none observed among the Nocardia strains. The 16S rRNA gene similarity suggested three strains represented candidates of novel taxa. Moreover, most of the Nocardia were rare environmental species. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that amoxicillin/clavulanate (2/1), imipenem, and linezolid were active against Nocardia strains, but they were not susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

All rights reserved.Mafic-ultramafic rocks and other types of rocks were collected from Sa Kaeo and Pattani sutures. Both sutures are suspected to be a connection between the Nan suture in Northern Thailand and the Bentong-Raub suture that runs across the southern border of Thailand to Malaysia. Rocks were collected from four locations along Sa Kaeo suture: Khao Priwan (Location 1), Wang Somboon (Location 2), Khao Pun-Soi Dao (Location 3), and Pong Nam Ron (Location 4) and one location from Sai Buri River along Pattani suture (Location 5). Both Sa Kaeo and Pattani sutures mainly consist of serpentinite, gabbro, diabase, basalt, pillow basalt, limestone interbedded with sandstone, and shale. Geochemically, the basalts (found in Locations 2, 3) are believed to erupt from the back-arc basin, which is related to within-plate alkali composition; the serpentinite (found in Location 1) is believed to be originated similarly through the process of mafic magma; whereas the pillow basalt taken from Pattani suture (Location 5) is tholeiitic MORB derived from the mantle. All the collected rocks from Sa Kaeo suture appear to be originated from a back-arc basin that had undergone ancient subduction during the Permian-Triassic period. While rock suits in Pattani suture show a similar serpentinized peridotite accumulation process, the found pillow basalts also suggest a possible close relationship to MORB and the ocean floor."

The study is based on proton- proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1, recorded at s = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016. Candidate events are selected by requiring an isolated high-momentum lepton (muon or electron) and exactly two jets, of which one is identified as originating from a bottom quark. Multivariate discriminants are designed to separate the signal from the background. Optimized thresholds are placed on the discriminant outputs to obtain an event sample with high signal purity. The top quark mass is found to be 172.13−0.77+0.76 GeV, where the uncertainty includes both the statistical and systematic components, reaching sub-GeV precision for the first time in this event topology. The masses of the top quark and antiquark are also determined separately using the lepton charge in the final state, from which the mass ratio and difference are determined to be 0.9952−0.0104+0.0079 and 0.83−1.35+1.79 GeV, respectively. The results are consistent with CPT invariance. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."

All rights reserved.Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a hyperglycemic condition occurring due to insulin resistance or impaired insulin secretion. Structural modifications of natural products are a promising way to discover new lead compounds for DM management. Oxyresvertrol, abundantly found in Artocarpus lacucha Buch. - Ham. heartwood and Morus alba L. wood, exhibited biological activities against metabolic syndromes associated with diseases including DM. Hence, in this study, oxyresveratrol was used as the precursor for its synthetic derivatives. Then, the compound and its nineteen derivatives were investigated for their glucose uptake activities in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells. The results showed that oxyresveratrol and its derivative, 5-carboxy-2,30,4,50-tetrahydroxystilbene, possess a higher glucose uptake activity than metformin. They also elevated AMPK alpha-1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, their binding energy against AMPK active sites was reported, and the finding would be applicable to further investigations of oxyresveratrol, including structure-activity relationship and structural modification."

HPV16 E1, a helicase required for HPV replication exhibits increased expression in association with cervical cancer progression, suggesting that E1 has a similar effect on the host as the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins. This study aimed to determine whether expression of HPV16 E1 correlated with carcinogenesis by modulating cellular pathways involved in cervical cancer. HEK293T cells were transfected with pEGFP, pEGFPE1 or truncated forms of HPV16 E1. Cell proliferation, cell death, and the impact of HPV16 E1 on host gene expression was then evaluated. HPV16 E1 overexpression resulted in a significant reduction of cell viability and cellular proliferation (p-value<0.0001). Moreover, prolonged expression of HPV16 E1 significantly induced both apoptotic and necrotic cell death, which was partially inhibited by QVD-OPH, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. Microarray, real time RT-PCR and kinetic host gene expression analyses revealed that HPV16 E1 overexpression resulted in the downregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis (RPL36A), metabolism (ALDOC), cellular proliferation (CREB5, HIF1A, JMJDIC, FOXO3, NFKB1, PIK3CA, TSC22D3), DNA damage (ATR, BRCA1 and CHEK1) and immune response (ISG20) pathways.

Health Science Reports published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Background and Aims: Mental illness among medical students is common. Identifying at-risk students can be beneficial in terms of prevention and treatment. This study examined the association between preadmission mental health evaluation and mental health service utilization among Thai medical students. Methods: The authors collected data from all first- to sixth-year students at one university hospital and three affiliated hospitals during the 2014 to 2019 academic year (n = 1642). Preadmission mental health was evaluated using the Thai Mental Health Indicators 66 (TMHI-66) questionnaire. Data from mental health service utilization included the dates of service and the clinical diagnosis. Data were analyzed using Cox regression, adjusted for sex, hometown, and affiliated hospital. Results: The prevalence of poor mental health was found to be 3.7% based on TMHI-66 results. The proportion of all students who sought mental health services was 8.3%, and they were mostly diagnosed with depressive disorder (3%), adjustment disorder (1.9%), and anxiety disorder (1.9%). Students with positive TMHI-66 results were more likely to seek out services at the faculty counseling center for one or more mental health problems (Hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, 95% CI 1.11-4.04, P =.024). Conclusion: Preadmission mental health was found to be associated with mental health service utilization. Depressive disorder was the most frequent mental illness among Thai medical students utilizing the faculty counseling services. Still, the number was far lower than the reported prevalence of mental disorders due to various reasons. Further studies are needed to investigate risk and protective factors for mental disorders to better promote mental health and encourage mental health service utilization in targeted students throughout medical education."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) is one of the many acoustic transducers. It is the most popular and widely used acoustic transducer for sensor applications. It has found wide applications in chemical and biosensing fields owing to its high sensitivity, robustness, small sized-design, and ease of integration with electronic measurement systems. However, it is necessary to coat QCM with a sensing film. Without coating materials, its selectivity and sensitivity are not obtained. At present, this is not an issue, mainly due to the advancement of oscillator circuits and dedicated measurement circuits. Since a new researcher may seek to understand QCM sensors, we provide an overview of QCM from its fundamental knowledge. Then, we explain some of the recent QCM applications both in gas-phase and liquid-phase. Next, the theory of QCM is introduced by using piezoelectric stress equations and the Mason equivalent circuit, which explains how the QCM behavior is obtained. Then, the conventional equations that govern QCM behaviors in terms of resonant frequency and resistance are described. We show the behavior of QCM with a viscous film based on the acoustic wave equation and Mason equivalent circuit. Then, we present various existing QCM electronic measurement methods. Furthermore, we describe the experiment on QCM with viscous loading and its interpretation based on the Mason equivalent circuit. Lastly, we review some theoretical models to describe QCM behavior with various models."

A simulation-based model is a viable option to help instructors and learners make understanding the accounting system components and monitoring the accounting transactions easier. This paper proposes a colored Petri net (CPN)-based model for the instruction of an accounting system focused on the journal entries processes, accounting modules, and accounting transaction flows. The CPN-based language and the model checking tool named CPN are used to represent the accounting system components: a chart of accounts, an account mapping profile, the journal and ledgers system, and the financial report creations. We evaluated the designed CPN models by creating the simulation cases from ground truth data of the retail department store system and the mortgage loan system, using the decision-table-based testing technique. The results show that the designed CPN model and provided simulation cases help the learners to animate, verify, trace back accounting transactions and data flows, and increase the learner’s understanding."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is a competitive solution for the durability of reinforced structures. This paper aims to observe the moment redistribution behavior occurring due to flexural and shear loading in Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer-(GFRP) reinforced continuous concrete beams. A rectangular cross-section was adopted in this study with dimensions of 200 mm in width and 300 mm in depth with a constant shear span-to-depth ratio of 3. The reinforcement ratio for the top and bottom were equal at sagging and hogging moment regions. A finite element model was created using Analysis System (ANSYS) and validated with the existing experimental results in the literature review. Based on the literature review, the parametric study was conducted on twelve beam specimens to evaluate the influence of concrete compressive strength, transversal GFRP stirrups ratio, and longitudinal reinforcement ratio on the redistribution of the moment in beams. Several codes and guidelines adopted different analytical models. The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) S806 adopted the modified compression field theory in predicting the shear capacity of the simply supported beams. Recently, various researchers encountered several factors and modifications to account for concrete contribution, longitudinal, and transverse reinforcement. A comparison between the predicting shear capacity of the generated finite element model, the analytical model, and the existing data from the literature was performed. The generated finite element model showed a good agreement with the experimental results, while the beam specimens failed in shear after undergoing significant moment redistribution from hogging to sagging moment region. The moment distribution observed about 21.5% from FEM of beam specimen GN-1.2-0.48-d, while the experimental results achieved 24% at failure load. For high strength concrete presented in beam specimen GH-1.2-0.63-d, the result showed about 20.2% moment distribution, compared to that achieved experimentally of 23% at failure load."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae has globally emerged as an urgent threat leading to the limitation for treatment. K. pneumoniae carrying blaOXA-48, which plays a broad magnitude of carbapenem susceptibility, is widely concerned. This study aimed to characterize related carbapenem resistance mechanisms and forage for new antibiotic combinations to combat blaOXA-48-carrying K. pneumoniae. Among nine isolates, there were two major clones and a singleton identified by ERIC-PCR. Most isolates were resistant to ertapenem (MIC range: 2–>256 mg/L), but two isolates were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem (MIC range: 0.5–1 mg/L). All blaOXA-48-carrying plasmids conferred carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli transformants. Two ertapenem-susceptible isolates carried both outer membrane proteins (OMPs), OmpK35 and OmpK36. Lack of at least an OMP was present in imipenem-resistant isolates. We evaluated the in vitro activity of an overlooked antibiotic, azithromycin, in combination with other antibiotics. Remarkably, azithromycin exhibited synergism with colistin and fosfomycin by 88.89% and 77.78%, respectively. Bacterial regrowth occurred after exposure to colistin or azithromycin alone. Interestingly, most isolates were killed, reaching synergism by this combination. In conclusion, the combination of azithromycin and colistin may be an alternative strategy in dealing with blaOXA-48-carrying K. pneumoniae infection during a recent shortage of newly effective antibiotic development."

Non-invasive diagnostic modalities including ultrasonography and clinical scoring systems have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy but with limited performance. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being integrated with conventional diagnostic methods in the hopes of performance improvements. We aimed to estimate the performance of AI-assisted systems for diagnosing NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver fibrosis. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify studies integrating AI in the diagnosis of NAFLD, NASH, and liver fibrosis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated. Results: Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis of 13 studies showed that AI significantly improved the diagnosis of NAFLD, NASH and liver fibrosis. AI-assisted ultrasonography had excellent performance for diagnosing NAFLD, with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91–0.99), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.89–1.00), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93–1.00), and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88–0.98), respectively.

Herein, four composite decks categorized into two types with shear span-to-depth ratios of 2.5 and 4.6 are designed for an experimental program. The decks then undergo the four-point bending tests until failure to investigate the structural responses, such as the load, displacement, crack mechanism, and failure mode. Conventional section analysis is used to derive the flexural strength of composite decks in comparison with the test results. Additionally, the ductility of the composite decks is assessed based on the displacement indices. The analysis results demonstrate that the stiffness and capacity of the composite deck increase with the decrease in the shear span length. However, the ductility of the composite slabs increases with the shear span length. The flexural strengths predicted by section analysis overestimate the actual test results. The shear span-to-depth ratio affects the crack mechanism of the composite decks."

In comparison with placebo, 2 weeks administration of the extract from Thai chili in mice caused loose feces and induced intestinal permeability defect as indicated by FITC-dextran assay and the reduction in tight junction molecules (occludin and zona occludens-1) using fluorescent staining and gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, the chili extracts also induced the translocation of gut pathogen molecules; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1!3)-β-D-glucan (BG) and fecal dysbiosis (microbiome analysis), including reduced Firmicutes, increased Bacteroides, and enhanced total Gram-negative bacteria in feces. Both L34 and LGG attenuated gut barrier defect (FITC-dextran, the fluorescent staining and gene expression of tight junction molecules) but not improved fecal consistency. Additionally, high concentrations of capsaicin (0.02–2 mM) damage enterocytes (Caco-2 and HT-29) as indicated by cell viability test, supernatant cytokine (IL-8), transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transepithelial FITC-dextran (4.4 kDa) but were attenuated by Lactobacillus condition media (LCM) from both probiotic-strains. The 24 h incubation with 2 mM capsaicin (but not the lower concentrations) reduced the abundance of LGG (but not L34) implying a higher capsaicin tolerance of L34. However, Lactobacillus rhamnosus fecal abundance, using qRT-PCR, of L34 or LGG after 3, 7, and 20 days of the administration in the Thai healthy volunteers demonstrated the similarity between both strains. In conclusion, high dose chili extracts impaired gut permeability and induced gut dysbiosis but were attenuated by probiotics. Despite a better capsaicin tolerance of L34 compared with LGG in vitro, L34 abundance in feces was not different to LGG in the healthy volunteers. More studies on probiotics with a higher intake of chili in human are interesting."

Screening of effective concentrations from 0.01 to 0.16% was conducted for each essential oil. The results showed that, of the essential oil treatments tested, a kaffir lime oil coating of 0.01% could best maintain the quality of fruits, reducing both weight loss and browning of the peel and spinterns. However, essential oil concentrations exceeding 0.04% severely damaged the fruit pericarp, in which scores of spintern browning were higher than those of peel browning. These results suggest that kaffir lime oil can maintain the postharvest quality of ‘Rongrien’ rambutan fruit as a supplement in some edible coatings."

The analysis is performed using data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb−1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is focused on heavy resonances, where the decay products of each top quark or W boson are expected to be reconstructed as a single, large-radius jet with a distinct substructure. The production of an excited bottom quark, b*, is used as a benchmark when setting limits on the cross section for a heavy resonance decaying to a top quark and a W boson. The hypotheses of b* quarks with left-handed, right-handed, and vector-like chiralities are excluded at 95% confidence level for masses below 2.6, 2.8, and 3.1 TeV, respectively.

Natural river sand was replaced with the granite waste at 25% and 50% by weight. The effect of moisture conditions of fine aggregates on the properties of the geopolymer concrete were also investigated. The fine aggregates were prepared in three different moisture states: saturated surface dry (SSD), air-dry (AD) and oven-dry (OD). It was found that the slump flow of the geopolymer concrete increased with the increasing proportion of the granite waste in the mixture. Meanwhile, the initial and the final setting times were not influenced by the inclusion of the granite waste except when the fine aggregates were saturated. The presence of angular shaped particles enhanced the early compressive strength of geopolymer concrete with 50% replacement of natural sand by the granite waste. Furthermore, the fire test results showed that the geopolymer concrete with the granite waste had a similar spalling behavior to the one made entirely with the natural sand, but tended to show inferior post-fire residual strengths, particularly when the oven-dried aggregates were used."
"['Genetics (clinical)', 'Pharmacology (medical)']","Gaucher disease: clinical phenotypes and refining GBA mutational spectrum in Thai patients  2021, The Author(s).Background: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia, with or without neurologic involvement. The disorder is categorized into three phenotypes: GD type 1 or nonneuronopathic GD; GD type 2 or acute neuronopathic GD; and GD type 3 or chronic neuronopathic GD. The purposes of this study were to describe clinical characteristics of Thai GD in patients diagnosed and/or followed up during 2010–2018 and to perform re-genotyping including analysis of GBA recombinant alleles which had not been investigated in Thai patients before. Results: There were 27 patients from seven medical centers, enrolled in the study. All the cases had pediatric onset. GD3 (44.5%) was the most common phenotype, followed by GD2 (40.7%) and GD1 (14.8%), with one case of neonatal GD. The median age of onset for GD1, GD2, and GD3 was 72, 4 and 12 months, respectively, suggesting relatively earlier onset of GD1 and GD3 in Thai patients. All patients with GD1 and most patients with GD3 received ERT. Four patients with GD3 had ERT followed by HSCT. Patients with GD3 who received no or late ERT showed unfavorable outcomes. We identified 14 variants including two novel (p.S384F and p.W533*) and 12 reported pathogenic variants: p.L483P, p.N409S, p.R159W, p.P305A, p.A175G, p.D448H, p.V414L, IVS2+1G>A, IVS6-1G>C, IVS7+1G>C, IVS9-3C>G, and Rec1a. The p.L483P was the most prevalent allele found in this study, at 66% (33/50 alleles), followed by IVS2+1G>A, Rec1a, and IVS6-1G>C. Twenty-four percent of patients were reassigned with validated genotypes, most of whom (4 of 6) were patients with GD2. The [p.S384F + p.W533*] being compounded with p.L483P, was found in the patient with neonatal GD, suggesting that the p.S384F could potentiate the deleterious effect of the p.W533*, and/or vice versa. Conclusions: Neuronopathic GD was strikingly prevalent among Thai affected population. Homozygous p.L483P was the most common genotype identified in Thai patients. Recombinant allele Rec1a and splicing mutations were associated with GD2 and severe cases of GD3. Mutation spectrum could be useful for designing stepwise molecular analysis, genetic screenings in population, and new therapeutic research for neuronopathic GD."

Using ex vivo porcine and rat skins, here we demonstrate that a detachable dissolvable microneedle (DDMN) array, a special dissolvable microneedle that allows needle detachment from the base within 2 min post administration, can effectively embed a model compound into epidermis and dermis. Diffusion of the compound from the needle embedding sites to the nearby skin tissue is demonstrated at various post administration periods. The relationship between the time that a conventional dissolvable microneedle array is left on skin without needle detachment from the base and the degree of skin surface abrasion at each microneedle penetration spot is also demonstrated on skin of human volunteers. Co-loading glutathione with vitamin C (vitC) can stabilize vitC in the DDMN. DDMN loaded with vitC and glutathione can help erasing post-acne-hyperpigmentation spots."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Transformers have demonstrated remarkable accomplishments in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks as well as image processing tasks. Herein, we present a deep-learning (DL) model that is capable of improving the semantic segmentation network in two ways. First, utilizing the pre-training Swin Transformer (SwinTF) under Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone, the model weights downstream tasks by joining task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Secondly, decoder designs are applied to our DL network with three decoder designs, U-Net, pyramid scene parsing (PSP) network, and feature pyramid network (FPN), to perform pixel-level segmentation. The results are compared with other image labeling state of the art (SOTA) methods, such as global convolutional network (GCN) and ViT. Extensive experiments show that our Swin Transformer (SwinTF) with decoder designs reached a new state of the art on the Thailand Isan Landsat-8 corpus (89.8% F1 score), Thailand North Landsat-8 corpus (63.12% F1 score), and competitive results on ISPRS Vaihingen. Moreover, both our best-proposed methods (SwinTF-PSP and SwinTF-FPN) even outperformed SwinTF with supervised pre-training ViT on the ImageNet-1K in the Thailand, Landsat-8, and ISPRS Vaihingen corpora."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Many agronomical wastes are produced annually in significant amounts after cultivation, especially in agricultural countries. This study applied biochar produced from the pyrolysis of cassava stems to improve soil with low fertility for maize cultivation. The effect of soil biochar incorporation on maize yield and productivity was also investigated. Eight experimental plots, each with four replicates, were applied with cassava stem biochar (CSB) at different rates of 0.5 kg/m2 (TB0.5), 2.5 kg/m2 (TB2.5) and 3.0 kg/m2 (TB3.0), fertilizer at 0.56 kg/m2 (TM), fertilizer at 0.56 kg/m2 mixed with CSB at 0.5 kg/m2 (TMB0.5), 2.5 kg/m2 (TMB2.5), 3.0 kg/m2 (TMB3.0) and untreated soil (TC). Pyrolysis of cassava stems at 450–500◦C produced strongly alkaline CSB with pH 9.6 and increased nutrient contents. Specific surface area and total pore volume increased, and pores were classified as mesoporous, while average pore diameter decreased. CSB had a highly stable carbon content of 58.46%, with high aromaticity and polarity obtained from O/C and H/C ratios. Results indicated that CSB enhanced and supported maize growth by improving soil physicochemical properties to suit cultivation. Applying CSB into the soil gave higher maize yield and productivity than cultivation using fertilizer. The highest yield and nutrition contents were obtained in seed from cultivation using fertilizer mixed with biochar at 3.0 kg/m2. Biochar production from cassava stems generated a useful commodity from waste material."

['Multidisciplinary'],"Investigating the role of the carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) in Leptospira spp.  2021 Phoka et al.Carbon Storage Regulator A (CsrA) is a well-characterized post-transcriptional global regulator that plays a critical role in response to environmental changes in many bacteria. CsrA has been reported to regulate several metabolic pathways, motility, biofilm formation, and virulence-associated genes. The role of csrA in Leptospira spp., which are able to survive in different environmental niches and infect a wide variety of reservoir hosts, has not been characterized. To investigate the role of csrA as a gene regulator in Leptospira, we generated a L. biflexa csrA deletion mutant (ΔcsrA) and csrA overexpressing Leptospira strains. The ΔcsrA L. biflexa displayed poor growth under starvation conditions. RNA sequencing revealed that in rich medium only a few genes, including the gene encoding the flagellar filament protein FlaB3, were differentially expressed in the ΔcsrA mutant. In contrast, 575 transcripts were differentially expressed when csrA was overexpressed in L. biflexa. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed the RNA-seq data in the ΔcsrA mutant, showing direct binding of recombinant CsrA to flaB3 mRNA. In the pathogen L. interrogans, we were not able to generate a csrA mutant. We therefore decided to overexpress csrA in L. interrogans. In contrast to the overexpressing strain of L. biflexa, the overexpressing L. interrogans strain had poor motility on soft agar. The overexpressing strain of L. interrogans also showed significant upregulation of the flagellin flaB1, flaB2, and flaB4. The interaction of L. interrogans rCsrA and flaB4 was confirmed by EMSA. Our results demonstrated that CsrA may function as a global regulator in Leptospira spp. under certain conditions that cause csrA overexpression. Interestingly, the mechanisms of action and gene targets of CsrA may be different between non-pathogenic and pathogenic Leptospira strains."

This is an open access article under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Viral marketing is one of the most effective and imperative marketing strategies. The prominence of digital technology and social media has elevated the importance of viral marketing campaigns by increasing their cost efficiency and enabling them to reach targeted audiences rapidly. This study aimed to examine the influence of viral marketing strategies on brand recognition and brand preference by developing a framework for the effectiveness of viral marketing (7I’s) in social media contexts and testing the associations among the 7I’s, brand recognition and brand preference. A quantitative research method with a structured questionnaire as the research tool was employed to collect data from a total of 286 respondents in Thailand. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilized to test the proposed hypotheses. The results showed that effective viral marketing relates positively to brand recognition (b = 0.440) and preference (b = 0.298). The mediation analysis also revealed that brand recognition partially mediates the relationship between effective viral marketing and brand preference. In terms of the moderating effects, the results indicated a stronger influence for effective viral marketing on brand preference among younger respondents (b = 0.336) than among older respondents (b = 0.278). This research makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by validating a theory-driven framework based on the novel concept of the 7I’s and its potential effect on customers’ brand perceptions."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Cement–clay Interlocking Hollow Brick Masonry (CCIHBM) walls are characterized by poor mechanical properties of bricks and mortar. Their performance is observed to be unsatisfactory under both gravity and seismic loads. There is an urgent need to develop sustainable, environmentally friendly, and low-cost strengthening materials to alter the structural behaviour of brick masonry walls in terms of strength and ductility. The results of an experimental investigation conducted on the diagonal compressive response of CCIHBM walls are presented in this study. In this experimental study, a total of six CCIHBM walls were constructed using cement–clay interlocking hollow bricks. One was tested as a control or reference wall, whereas the remaining walls were strengthened using cement mortar. In some walls, the cement mortar was also combined with the wire mesh. The research parameters included the type of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) (Type 1 and Type 2), thickness of cement mortar (10 mm and 20 mm), and layers of wire mesh (one and three layers). The experimental results indicate that control or unstrengthened CCIHBM walls failed in a very brittle manner at a very low ultimate load and deformation. The control CCIHBM wall, i.e., W-CON, failed at an ultimate load of 247 kN, and corresponding deflection was 1.8 mm. The strength and ductility of cement mortar and wire mesh-strengthened walls were found to be higher than the reference CCIHBM wall. For example, the ultimate load and deformation of cement-mortar-strengthened wall were found to be 143% and 233% higher than the control wall, respectively. Additionally, the ultimate failure modes of cement mortar and wire mesh strengthened were observed as ductile as compared to the brittle failure of reference wall or unstrengthened CCIHBM wall, which increased by 66% and 150% as compared with the control wall."

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is the only common antigen across most viral families. Anti-dsRNA immunofluorescence has shown promising results in vitro; however, its diagnostic value in respiratory specimens has not been evaluated. Methods: Consecutive inpatient cases of suspected respiratory viral infections were prospectively enrolled. Respiratory samples were collected and divided for anti-dsRNA immunofluorescence (index test) and 19-subtypes respiratory virus microarray (reference standard). Using fluorescence microscopy, positive or negative anti-dsRNA IF results were determined independently by two raters. Results: By microarray, 108 and 87 samples were positive and negative for viruses, respectively. The anti-dsRNA IF sensitivity was 83.3% (95%CI 76.1%–90.2%), while specificity was 87.4% (95%CI 80.8%–93.7%). Conclusions: Anti-dsRNA IF is simple to perform, with acceptable accuracy, and suitable for point-of-care respiratory virus screening. Unlike most molecular techniques, known viral genome sequences are not required."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.An anterior open bite is one of the most difficult malocclusions in orthodontic treatment. For such malocclusion, orthodontic miniscrew insertion into both buccal and palatal alveolar regions has been indicated for molar intrusion, but it involves a risk of tooth root injury. To solve the problem, a midpalatal miniscrew-attached extension arm (MMEA) is adopted. However, this method causes palatal tipping of the molar because intrusive loads were applied only from the palatal side. Currently, a transpalatal arch is added to avoi0d tipping movement, but it induces the patient’s discomfort. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the loading conditions for maxillary molar intrusion without tipping movement, only by MMEA through finite element (FE) analysis. FE models of maxillary right first molar and surrounding tissues were created. Three hook positions of MMEA were set at 6.0 mm perpendicular intervals in the occluso-apical direction along the mucosal contour. An intrusive unit load was applied from the palatal side of the molar, and various counter loads were applied from the buccal side. An optimal counter load for molar intrusion without palatal tipping was observed in each hook position. In conclusion, an ideal maxillary molar intrusion can be achieved only by MMEA with an optimal counter load."

It affects the stabilities of individual oscillators as well as the characteristics of their response to external forces. In the auditory system, the mechanical coupling between sensory hair cells has been proposed as a mechanism that enhances the inner ear's sensitivity and frequency discrimination. While extensive studies investigate the effects of coupling on the detection of a sinusoidal signal, the role of coupling underlying the response to a complex tone remains elusive. In this study, we measured the acoustic intermodulation distortions (IMDs) produced by the inner ears of two frog species stimulated simultaneously by two pure tones. The distortion intensity level displayed multiple peaks across stimulus frequencies, in contrast to the generic response from a single nonlinear oscillator. The multiple-peaked pattern was altered upon varying the stimulus intensity or an application of a perturbation tone near the distortion frequency. Numerical results of IMDs from a chain of coupled active nonlinear oscillators driven by two sinusoidal forces reveal the effects of coupling on the variation profile of the distortion amplitude. When the multiple-peaked pattern is observed, the chain's motion at the distortion frequency displays both a progressive wave and a standing wave. The latter arises due to coupling and is responsible for the multiple-peaked pattern. Our results illustrate the significance of mechanical coupling between active hair cells in the generation of auditory distortions, as a mechanism underlying the formation of in vivo standing waves of distortion signals."

Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park (CU 100) was established to mitigate the effects of climate change, especially flood prevention. This study focused on quantifying the ecosystem services provided by the trees in the park in terms of regulating and provisioning services. A publicly available tool, the i-Tree Eco international software, was used with data obtained from a local weather station as proxies to determine the accuracy of the analysis. Services, quantified in terms of monetary value, included avoided runoff, carbon storage, carbon sequestration, pollution removal, and timber price. The total monetary benefits, obtained from 697 trees (56 species, 49 genera, and 22 families), were estimated at USD 101,400. Of the total services, provisioning services contributed 75% to the total monetary value. Among all regulating services, the avoided runoff contributed about 60%, which was considered as the goal achieved by the park design. Azadirachta indica A.

Workers switched over to safely work from home. Our findings bring out the changes required to be affected in the three broad environmental dimensions to limit their vulnerability status experienced during the pandemic. Office building designs should be fundamentally oriented to provide certain safety protective measures to the workers, such as touch-free technologies, open working layouts, and workplace flexibilities to diminish the probability of getting infected.

The objective of the survey is to determine the level of knowledge and clinical practices related to POD among anesthesiologists in different Asian countries. A questionnaire of 22 questions was designed by members of the Asian focus group for the study of POD, and it was sent to anesthesiologists in Singapore, Thailand, and South Korea from 1 April 2019 through 17 September 2019. In total, 531 anesthesiologists (Singapore: 224, Thailand: 124, Korea: 183) responded to the survey. Half the respondents estimated the incidence of POD to be 11–30% and believed that it typically occurs in the first 48 h after surgery. Among eight important postoperative complications, POD was ranked fifth. While 51.4% did not perform any test for POD, only 13.7% monitored the depth of anesthesia in all their patients. However, 83.8% preferred depth of anesthesia monitoring if they underwent surgery themselves. The results suggest that Asian anesthesiologists underestimate the incidence and relevance of POD. Because it increases perioperative mortality and morbidity, there is an urgent need to educate anesthesiologists regarding the recognition, prevention, detection, and management of POD."

The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present a Spitzer/IRAC survey of H-faint (H 160 ⪆ 26.4, < 5σ) sources in 101 lensing cluster fields. Across a CANDELS/Wide-like survey area of ∼648 arcmin2 (effectively ∼221 arcmin2 in the source plane), we have securely discovered 53 sources in the IRAC Channel-2 band (CH2, 4.5 μm; median CH2 = 22.46 ± 0.11 AB mag) that lack robust HST/WFC3-IR F160W counterparts. The most remarkable source in our sample, namely ES-009 in the field of Abell 2813, is the brightest H-faint galaxy at 4.5 μm known so far (CH2 = 20.48 ± 0.03 AB mag). We show that the H-faint sources in our sample are massive (median M star = 1010.3±0.3 M o˙), star-forming (median star formation rate 100-40+60 M o˙ yr-1), and dust-obscured (A V = 2.6 ± 0.3) galaxies around a median photometric redshift of z = 3.9 ± 0.4. The stellar continua of 14 H-faint galaxies can be resolved in the CH2 band, suggesting a median circularized effective radius (R e,circ; lensing corrected) of 1.9 ± 0.2 kpc and <1.5 kpc for the resolved and whole samples, respectively. This is consistent with the sizes of massive unobscured galaxies at z ∼ 4, indicating that H-faint galaxies represent the dusty tail of the distribution of a wider galaxy population. Comparing with the ALMA dust continuum sizes of similar galaxies reported previously, we conclude that the heavy dust obscuration in H-faint galaxies is related to the compactness of both stellar and dust continua (R e,circ ∼ 1 kpc). These H-faint galaxies make up 16-7+13% of the galaxies in the stellar-mass range of 1010 - 1011.2 M o˙ at z = 3 ∼ 5, contributing to 8-4+8% of the cosmic star formation rate density in this epoch and likely tracing the early phase of massive galaxy formation."

In Asia, serological evidence indicated that CHIKV first emerged in 1954. From the 1950’s to 2005, sporadic CHIKV infections were attributed to the Asian genotype. However, the massive outbreak of CHIKV in India and the Southwest Indian Ocean Islands in 2005 has since raised chikungunya as a worldwide public health concern. The virus is spreading globally, but mostly in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South and Southeast Asia. The emergence of the CHIKV East/Central/South African genotype-Indian Ocean lineage (ECSA-IOL) has caused large outbreaks in South and Southeast Asia affected more than a million people over a decade. Notably, the massive CHIKV outbreaks before 2016 and the more recent outbreak in Asia were driven by distinct ECSA lineages. The first significant CHIKV ECSA strains harbored the Aedes albopictus-adaptive mutation E1: A226V. More recently, another mass CHIKV ECSA outbreak in Asia started in India and spread beyond South and Southeast Asia to Kenya and Italy. This virus lacked the E1: A226V mutation but instead harbored two novel mutations (E1: K211E and E2: V264A) in an E1: 226A background, which enhanced its fitness in Aedes aegypti. The emergence of a novel ECSA strain may lead to a more widespread geographical distribution of CHIKV in the future. This review summarizes the current CHIKV situation in Asian countries and provides a general overview of the molecular virology, disease manifestation, diagnosis, prevalence, genotype distribution, evolutionary relationships, and epidemiology of CHIKV infection in Asian countries over the past 65 years. This knowledge is essential in guiding the epidemiological study, control, prevention of future CHIKV outbreaks, and the development of new vaccines and antivirals targeting CHIKV."

Zewde et al  2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular TherapyAcute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of mortality in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. The skin is the most commonly involved organ in GVHD. Elafin, a protease inhibitor overexpressed in inflamed epidermis, was previously identified as a diagnostic biomarker of skin GVHD; however, this finding was restricted to a subset of patients with isolated skin GVHD. The main driver of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in HCT recipients is gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD. Two biomarkers, Regenerating islet-derived 3a (REG3α) and Suppressor of tumorigenesis 2 (ST2), have been validated as biomarkers of GI GVHD that predict long-term outcomes in patients treated for GVHD. We undertook this study to determine the utility of elafin as a prognostic biomarker in the general population of acute GVHD patients in whom GVHD may develop in multiple organs. We analyzed serum elafin concentrations as a predictive biomarker of acute GVHD outcomes and compared it with ST2 and REG3α in a large group of patients treated at multiple centers. A total of 526 patients from the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) who had received corticosteroid treatment for skin GVHD and who had not been previously studied were analyzed. Serum concentrations of elafin, ST2, and REG3α were measured by ELISA in all patients. The patients were divided at random into equal training and validation sets, and a competing-risk regression model was developed to model 6-month NRM using elafin concentration in the training set. Additional models were developed using concentrations of ST2 and REG3α or the combination of all 3 biomarkers as predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using the validation set to evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model and to stratify patients into high- and low-risk biomarker groups. The cumulative incidence of 6-month NRM, overall survival (OS), and 4-week treatment response were compared between the risk groups. Unexpectedly, patients in the low-risk elafin group demonstrated a higher incidence of 6-month NRM, although the difference was not statistically significant (17% versus 11%; P = .19). OS at 6 months (68% versus 68%; P > .99) and 4-week response (78% versus 78%; P = .98) were similar in the low-risk and high-risk elafin groups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.55 for elafin and 0.75 for the combination of ST2 and REG3α. The addition of elafin to the other 2 biomarkers did not improve the AUC. Our data indicate that serum elafin concentrations measured at the initiation of systemic treatment for acute GVHD did not predict 6-month NRM, OS, or treatment response in a multicenter population of patients treated systemically for acute GVHD. As seen in previous studies, serum concentrations of the GI GVHD biomarkers ST2 and REG3α were significant predictors of NRM, and the addition of elafin levels did not improve their accuracy. These results underscore the importance of GI disease in driving NRM in patients who develop acute GVHD."
"['Parasitology', 'Infectious Diseases']","Genetic population of Plasmodium knowlesi during pre-malaria elimination in Thailand  2021, The Author(s).Background: Thailand is committed to eliminating malaria by 2024. From 2013 to 2020, the total number of malaria cases have decreased, from 37,741 to 4474 (an 88.1% reduction). However, infections with Plasmodium knowlesi, a monkey malarial pathogen that can also infect humans, have been increasingly observed. This study focused on the molecular analysis of P. knowlesi parasites causing malaria in Thailand. Methods: Under Thailand’s integrated Drug Efficacy Surveillance (iDES), which includes drug-resistance monitoring as part of routine case-based surveillance and responses, specimens were collected from malaria patients (n = 966) between 2018 and 2020. Thirty-one mono P. knowlesi infections (3.1%), most of which were from eastern and southern Thailand, were observed and confirmed by nested PCR assay and DNA sequencing. To evaluate whether these pathogens were from different lineages, cluster analysis based on seven microsatellite genotyping markers and the merozoite surface protein 1 (pkmsp1) gene was carried out. The P. knowlesi pyrimethamine resistance gene dihydrofolate reductase (pkdhfr) was sequenced and homology modelling was constructed. Results: The results of analysing the seven microsatellite markers and pkmsp1 sequence demonstrated that P. knowlesi parasites from eastern Thailand were of the same lineage as those isolated in Cambodia, while the parasites causing malaria in southern Thailand were the same lineage as those isolated from Malaysia. The sequencing results for the pkdhfr genes indicated the presence of two mutations, Arg34Leu and a deletion at position 105. On analysis with homology modelling, the two mutations were not associated with anti-malarial drug resistance. Conclusions: This report compared the genetic populations of P. knowlesi parasites in Thailand from 2018 to 2020 and have shown similar lineages as those isolated in Cambodia and Malaysia of P. knowlesi infection in Thailand and demonstrated that the P. knowlesi parasites were of the same lineages as those isolated in Cambodia and Malaysia. The parasites were also shown to be sensitive to pyrimethamine."

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).The effects of the ultra-high-molecular-weight (UHMW) component of polypropylene (PP) on its rheological properties, crystallization behavior, and solid-state mechanical properties were investigated using various measurement techniques. The terminal relaxation time—determined by measuring the linear viscoelasticity—was increased by adding the UHMW component. The increase in the melt elasticity produced by adding the UHMW component was observed by measuring the steady-state shear flow, although the shear viscosity was not greatly affected. Owing to the long characteristic time of the Rouse relaxation of the UHMW component, PP with the UHMW component formed highly oriented structures through a shear-induced crystallization process. The addition of the UHMW component enhanced the orientation and regularity of crystalline structure for extruded films. Therefore, the Young’s modulus, yield stress, and strength were higher in the PP film containing the UHMW component than in one without the UHMW component, irrespective of the direction of tensile deformation."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). BPA exposure dysregulates ASD-related genes in the hippocampus and neurological functions of offspring. However, whether prenatal BPA exposure has an impact on genes in the prefrontal cortex, another brain region highly implicated in ASD, and through what mechanisms have not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts the transcriptome–interactome profiles of the prefrontal cortex of neonatal rats. Interestingly, the list of BPA-responsive genes was significantly enriched with known ASD candidate genes, as well as genes that were dysregulated in the postmortem brain tissues of ASD cases from multiple independent studies. Moreover, several differentially expressed genes in the offspring’s prefrontal cortex were the targets of ASD-related transcription factors, including AR, ESR1, and RORA. The hypergeometric distribution analysis revealed that BPA may regulate the expression of such genes through these transcription factors in a sex-dependent manner. The molecular docking analysis of BPA and ASD-related transcription factors revealed novel potential targets of BPA, including RORA, SOX5, TCF4, and YY1. Our findings indicated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts ASD-related genes in the offspring’s prefrontal cortex and may increase the risk of ASD through sex-dependent molecular mechanisms, which should be investigated further."

Anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulin G (anti-N IgG) titer in serum samples collected at a single (N = 302) or multiple time points (N = 229) 3–12 months after COVID-19 symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens was measured by semiquantitative chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. The 531 patients (966 specimens) were classified according to the presence or absence of pneumonia symptoms. Anti N IgG was detected in 87.5% of patients (328/375) at 3 months, 38.6% (93/241) at 6 months, 23.7% (49/207) at 9 months, and 26.6% (38/143) at 12 months. The anti-N IgG seropositivity rate was significantly lower at 6, 9, and 12 months than at 3 months (P < 0.01) and was higher in the pneumonia group than in the non-pneumonia/asymptomatic group at 6 months (P < 0.01), 9 months (P = 0.04), and 12 months (P = 0.04). The rate started to decline 6–12 months after symptom onset. Anti-N IgG sample/cutoff index was positively correlated with age (r = 0.192, P < 0.01) but negatively correlated with interval between symptom onset and blood sampling (r = − 0.567, P < 0.01).

['Multidisciplinary'],"The effects of oral Aloe vera on the efficacy of transplanted human endothelial cells and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases in diabetic wound healing  2021 The Author(s)Background: Diabetic wounds are characterized by delayed healing and impaired angiogenesis. Aloe vera and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are reported to facilitate wound healing, and the former also has hypoglycemic property. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that play a role in diabetic wound pathogenesis. Objective: To investigate whether oral Aloe vera can enhance the efficacy of HUVEC transplantation and inhibit the expression of matrix metalloproteinases in wound healing of diabetic mice. Materials and methods: BALB/c nude mice were randomly assigned into five groups: normal control group, diabetic group (DM), DM transplanted with HUVECs, DM treated with oral Aloe vera, and DM treated with combined HUVECs and oral Aloe vera. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Bilateral full-thickness excision cutaneous wounds were created. At days 7 and 14 post-wounding, the following parameters were determined: blood glucose, wound area, wound perfusion, capillary vascularity, re-epithelialization rate and tissue VEGF levels. Tissue expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were compared between the DM mice and those treated with oral Aloe vera. Results: Over days 7 and 14, Aloe vera exerted glucose-lowering effect in diabetic mice. Higher wound closure rate, blood flow and capillary vascularity, and lower MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions were observed at both time points in DM treated with Aloe vera group compared with DM group (P < 0.05). Moreover, combined therapy of HUVECs and oral Aloe vera was more effective than Aloe vera or HUVECs alone in increasing VEGF levels, capillary vascularity and wound perfusion. Blood glucose levels were negatively correlated with angiogenesis (P = 0.000. Conclusion: It is suggested that oral Aloe vera enhances the efficacy of HUVEC transplantation on diabetic wound angiogenesis, partly through improving glycemic control. Oral Aloe vera also promotes diabetic wound healing via inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions."

The genus Mucuna produces papilionaceous flowers and has an explosive flower-opening step. Explosive opening rapidly exposes stamens and pistil from keel petals and releases pollen. The flower of this species depends completely on animals to perform this step, essential for pollination success. Using a camera trap survey, we revealed that non-flying mammals, such as squirrels (Callosciurus sp.) and masked palm civets (Paguma larvata), opened flowers explosively. Thus, these mammals contribute to the pollination of M. thailandica. This is the first report of non-flying mammals contributing to pollination in montane forests in tropical Asia."

All rights reserved.Background/Aim: Cancer metastasis is the main cause of mortality in cancer patients. As lung cancer patients are mostly detected at metastatic stages, strategies that inhibit cancer metastasis may offer effective therapies. Activation of FAK and Akt/mTOR pathways promotes the highly metastatic phenotypes of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We unraveled EMT inhibitory action of pongamol and the mechanism controlling cell dissemination in lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of pongamol were determined by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis and necrosis induction in response to pongamol treatment was observed and visualized by nuclei staining assay. Wound healing migration, invasion, and anchorage-dependent growth assay were conducted to evaluate metastatic behaviors. EMT protein expression and FAK pathway were detected by western blot analysis. Results: Pongamol at 0-100 μM exhibited significant inhibition on migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Regarding anoikis resistance potential, the compound significantly inhibited survival and growth of cancer cells in an anchorage-independent manner, as indicated by the depletion of growing colonies in pongamol-pretreated cells. Protein level analysis further showed that pongamol exerted its anti-metastasis effect by inhibiting EMT, as indicated by a decrease of several mesenchymal proteins (N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, and Slug). Regarding the up-stream mechanisms, we found that pongamol inhibited activation of FAK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Conclusion: Pongamol exhibits potent anti-metastatic activity through suppressing key potentiating factors of cancer metastasis EMT and FAK."

All rights reserved.Background: Despite previous reports suggesting that pressure support ventilation facilitates weaning from mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, few studies have assessed its effects on recovery from anesthesia. The authors hypothesized that pressure support ventilation during emergence from anesthesia reduces postoperative atelectasis in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery using the Trendelenburg position. Methods: In this randomized controlled double-blinded trial, adult patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy or robot-assisted prostatectomy were assigned to either the pressure support (n = 50) or the control group (n = 50). During emergence (from the end of surgery to extubation), pressure support ventilation was used in the pressure support group versus intermittent manual assistance in the control group. The primary outcome was the incidence of atelectasis diagnosed by lung ultrasonography at the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). The secondary outcomes were Pao2at PACU and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry less than 92% during 48 h postoperatively. Results: Ninety-seven patients were included in the analysis. The duration of emergence was 9 min and 8 min in the pressure support and control groups, respectively. The incidence of atelectasis at PACU was lower in the pressure support group compared to that in the control group (pressure support vs. control, 16 of 48 [33%] vs. 28 of 49 [57%]; risk ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.91; P = 0.024). In the PACU, Pao2in the pressure support group was higher than that in the control group (92 ± 26 mmHg vs. 83 ± 13 mmHg; P = 0.034). The incidence of oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry less than 92% during 48 h postoperatively was not different between the groups (9 of 48 [19%] vs. 11 of 49 [22%]; P = 0.653). There were no adverse events related to the study protocol. Conclusions: The incidence of postoperative atelectasis was lower in patients undergoing either laparoscopic colectomy or robot-assisted prostatectomy who received pressure support ventilation during emergence from general anesthesia compared to those receiving intermittent manual assistance."

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background A previous review on hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence in 2005 categorized Southeast Asia as a low HAV endemicity region. In 2010, the World Health Organization modified this from low to low/medium endemicity, pointing out that these estimates were based on limited evidence. Since then, there has been no attempt to review HAV epidemiology from this region. We conducted a systematic review of literature to collect information on HAV incidence and seroprevalence in select countries in the Southeast Asian region, specifically, The Association of Southeast Asian Nations over the last 20 years. Methodology This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. From the relevant articles, we extracted data and conducted a risk of bias assessment of individual studies. Results The search yielded 22 and 13 publications on HAV seroprevalence and incidence, respectively. Overall, our findings point to a very low HAV endemicity profile in Thailand and Singapore and evidence of a shift towards low HAV endemicity in Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Only Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines have existing HAV disease surveillance and reported incidence rates below 1 per 100,000. Several outbreaks with varying magnitude documented in the region provide insights into the evolving epidemiology of HAV in the region. Risk of bias assessment of studies revealed that the individual studies were of low to medium risk. Conclusions/Significance The available HAV endemicity profiles in Southeast Asian countries, aside from Thailand, are limited and outdated, but suggest an endemicity shift in the region that is not fully documented yet. These findings highlight the need to update information on HAV epidemiology through strengthening of disease surveillance mechanisms to confirm the shift in HAV endemicity in the region."

Tree-ring analysis can provide important information for understanding long-term trends in carbon-fixation capacity under climate change. However, tree-ring studies in tropical regions are limited. We carried out a tree-ring analysis to investigate the dendrochronological potential of the tropical forest tree Choerospondias axillaris (Anacardiaceae) in east-central Thailand. Our study focused on growth-climate relationships and long-term growth trends. A chronology was constructed covering the period from 1932 to 2019. The tree-ring width index of C. axillaris was positively correlated with precipitation in June, July, and October. Furthermore, growth of C. axillaris was positively correlated with the Standard-ized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) from July to October, indicating that growth of C. axillaris is mainly limited by moisture availability in the late monsoon season. Moving correlation analysis further revealed the consistency and temporal stability of the relationship of tree growth with monsoon season precipitation and SPEI during the period under study. There was a significant increasing trend in long-term growth from 1932 to 2002 (slope = 0.017, p < 0.001); however, long-term growth decreased from 2003 to 2019 (slope = −0.014, p < 0.001).

Copyright  2021 by the Association of Bone and Joint SurgeonsBackground Previous studies have shown that intraoperative cerebral desaturation in patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the beach chair position varies widely, from 0% to 80%. To our knowledge, the risk of intraoperative cerebral desaturation is not known after all identified intraoperative modifiable physiologic parameters that influence cerebral blood flow have been controlled for. Questions/purposes (1) What is the risk of intraoperative cerebral desaturation during shoulder surgery with the patient in the beach chair position when patients received combined general anesthesia and an interscalene block, and what other factors associated with intraoperative cerebral desaturation can be identified? (2) Is intraoperative cerebral desaturation associated with 24-hour cognitive decline? (3) What factors are associated with intraoperative hypotension? Methods Between April and December 2020, 51 patients underwent elective shoulder surgery in the beach chair position at one center. Nine patients were excluded: four patients refused to participate, two patients were unable to receive an interscalene brachial plexus block, and three patients were operated on in less than 70° upright position. A total of 42 patients (aged 63 ± 10 years, of whom 52% [22 of 42] were female) were prospectively recruited into this study. Each patient was diagnosed with a rotator cuff tear and underwent arthroscopic repair in the beach chair position, which was performed in an upright position of 70° to 80°. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor regional cerebral oxygen saturation. The mean arterial pressure was monitored and controlled so that it was more than 70 mmHg in patients without hypertension and within 20% from the baseline mean arterial pressure in patients with hypertension. All patients received the standardized anesthesia protocol, which consisted of an interscalene brachial plexus block and general anesthesia. Intraoperative cerebral desaturation was defined as a decrease in the regional cerebral oxygen saturation level of more than 20% from the baseline value that lasted longer than 15 seconds after induction of anesthesia. Patients’ clinical characteristics such as age, sex, BMI, preoperative hemoglobin level, preexisting medical conditions, and continuing antihypertensive medications on the morning of surgery were analyzed to identify the association with intraoperative cerebral desaturation. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to assess cognitive function at preoperative and 24 hours postoperative. Episodes of hypotension and its treatment after maximum head elevation were recorded. The patients’ clinical characteristics were analyzed to determine their association with hypotensive events. Results In this study, intraoperative cerebral desaturation occurred in 43% (18 of 42) of patients, and female sex was identified as an associated risk (odds ratio 4.3 [95% confidence interval 1.2 to 16.2]; p = 0.03). The median (interquartile range) duration of intraoperative cerebral desaturation was 19 minutes (5 to 38). There was no association between intraoperative cerebral desaturation and 24-hour postoperative cognitive decline (OR 0.6 [95% CI 0.1 to 2.4]; p = 0.44). Risk factors for intraoperative hypotension were a history of hypertension, regardless of whether or not the patient took antihypertensive drugs on the morning of surgery (OR 4.9 [95% CI 1.3 to 18.1]; p = 0.02), and dyslipidemia (OR 4.3 [95% CI 1.2 to 16.3]; p = 0.03). Conclusion The intraoperative cerebral desaturation risk in the beach chair position was high. Female sex was an intraoperative cerebral desaturation risk factor. However, there was no association between intraoperative cerebral desaturation and postoperative cognitive decline. Patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia are at risk of intraoperative hypotension after positioning. Further large-scale studies are required to identify intraoperative cerebral desaturation–associated adverse neurologic outcome."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Binary-blended hydrogels fabricated from Bombyx mori silk fibroin (SF) and recombinant spider silk protein eADF4(C16) were developed and investigated concerning gelation and cellular interactions in vitro. With an increasing concentration of eADF4(C16), the gelation time of SF was shortened from typically one week to less than 48 h depending on the blending ratio. The biological tests with primary cells and two cell lines revealed that the cells cannot adhere and preferably formed cell aggregates on eADF4(C16) hydrogels, due to the polyanionic properties of eADF4(C16). Mixing SF in the blends ameliorated the cellular activities, as the proliferation of L929 fibroblasts and SaOS-2 osteoblast-like cells increased with an increase of SF content. The blended SF:eADF4(C16) hydrogels attained the advantages as well as overcame the limitations of each indi-vidual material, underlining the utilization of the hydrogels in several biomedical applications."

Glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel production that could react with SCM, producing glycerol ethers (GEs). Simultaneous conversion of triglycerides and glycerol in SCM is promising to reduce the glycerol surplus. These GEs are completely miscible with biodiesel and work as fuel enhancer. In a batch reactor, the glycerol reaction with SCM was investigated between 325 °C and 400 °C. The methanol-to-glycerol molar ratios and reaction time were varied from 3:1 to 9:1 and 8 min to 12 min, respectively. It was observed that the reactions of glycerol and SCM were etherification, dehydration, and thermal decomposition of glycerol. At molar ratios of 3:1 and 6:1, the temperature and reaction time significantly enhanced the glycerol conversion, especially by the thermal decomposition reaction. The increasing methanol-to-glycerol molar ratios reduced the overall glycerol conversion. The maximum glycerol conversion of 46.40% was observed at reaction temperature of 400 °C, methanol-to-glycerol molar ratio of 3:1, and reaction time of 12 min. Besides, the effects of GEs-to-neat biodiesel (B100) volumetric ratios on the fuel properties were investigated. The blending of GEs positively improved the viscosity and cloud point, whereas it had no impact on the heating value and flash point."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (S. pseudintermedius) infected wounds can cause seriously delayed wound healing processes in animals. Antimicrobial agents that have antimicrobial and wound healing efficacy have become an essential tool for overcoming this problem. In our previous study, anisotropic AgNPs have been reported to have antimicrobial efficiency against animal and human pathogens, and could be suitable as antimicrobial agents for infected wounds. Here, antimi-crobial and wound healing activities of anisotropic AgNPs gels were assessed in vivo. BALB/cAJcl mice wounds were infected by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). Then, antibacterial and wound healing activities were evaluated by bacterial cell count, wound contraction, digital capture, and histology. The results show that anisotropic AgNPs gels could eliminate all bacterial cell infected wounds within 7 days, the same as povidone iodine. Wound healing activity was evaluated by wound contraction (%). The results showed 100% wound contraction in groups treated with anisotropic AgNPs gels within 14 days that was not significantly different from povidone iodine and control gel without AgNPs. However, the digital capture of wounds on day 4 showed that anisotropic AgNPs gel prevented pus formation and reduced scar appearance within 21 days. The histology results exhibit improved collagen fiber alignment that supports scar disappearance. In conclusion, these results indicate that anisotropic AgNPs gels are suitable for treating infected wounds. The gel is effective in eliminating bacteria that supports the natural process of wound repair and also causes reduced scar formation."
"['Chemistry (all)', 'Polymers and Plastics']","In vivo biocompatible self-assembled nanogel based on hyaluronic acid for aqueous solubility and stability enhancement of asiatic acid  2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Asiatic acid (AA), a natural triterpene found in Centalla asiatica, possesses polypharmacological properties that can contribute to the treatment and prophylaxis of various diseases. However, its hydrophobic nature and rapid metabolic rate lead to poor bioavailability. The aim of this research was to develop a thermoresponsive nanogel from hyaluronic acid (HA) for solubility and stability enhancement of AA. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) was conjugated onto HA using a carbodiimide reaction followed by1H NMR characterization. pNIPAM-grafted HA (HA-pNIPAM) nanogels were prepared with three concentrations of polymer, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.25% w/v, in water by the sonication method. AA was loaded into the nanogel by the incubation method. Size, morphology, AA loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were analyzed. In vitro cytocompatibility was evaluated in fibroblast L-929 cells using the PrestoBlue assay. Single-dose toxicity was studied using rats. HA-pNIPAM nanogels at a 4.88% grafting degree showed reversible thermo-responsive behavior. All nanogel formulations could significantly increase AA water solubility and the stability was higher in nanogels prepared with high polymer concentrations over 180 days. The cell culture study showed that 12.5 µM AA in nanogel formulations was considered non-toxic to the L-929 cells; however, a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed at higher AA-loaded concentrations. In vivo study proved the non-toxic effect of AA loaded in HA-pNIPAM nanogels compared with the control. Taken together, HA-pNIPAM nanogel is a promising biocompatible delivery system both in vitro and in vivo for hydrophobic AA molecules."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Safety of PRRSV-2 MLV vaccines administrated via the intramuscular or intradermal route and evaluation of PRRSV transmission upon needle-free and needle delivery  2021, The Author(s).Two distinct experiments (Exp) were conducted to evaluate the shedding and efficacy of 2 modified live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) type 2 vaccines (MLV) when administered intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID) (Exp A), and the potential of PRRSV transmission using a needle-free device (Exp B). One-hundred fifty-four, 3-week-old castrated-male, pigs were procured from a PRRSV-free herd. In Exp A, 112 pigs were randomly allocated into 4 groups of 21 pigs including IM/Ingelvac MLV (G1), IM/Prime Pac (G2), ID/Prime Pac (G3), and non-vaccination (G4). Twenty-eight remaining pigs were served as non-vaccination, age-matched sentinel pigs. G1 was IM vaccinated once with Ingelvac PRRS MLV (Ing) (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany). G2 and G3 were IM and ID vaccinated once with a different MLV, Prime Pac PRRS (PP) (MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands), respectively. Following vaccination, an antibody response, IFN-γ-SC, and IL-10 secretion in supernatants of stimulated PBMC were monitored. Sera, tonsils, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, urines, and feces were collected from 3 vaccinated pigs each week to 42 days post-vaccination (DPV) and assayed for the presence of PRRSV using virus isolation and qPCR. Age-matched sentinel pigs were used to evaluate the transmission of vaccine viruses and were introduced into vaccinated groups from 0 to 42 DPV. Seroconversion was monitored. In Exp B, 42 pigs were randomly allocated into 5 groups of 3 pigs each including IM/High (T1), ID/High (T2), IM/Low (T3), ID/Low (T4), and NoChal. Twenty-seven remaining pigs were left as non-challenge, age-matched sentinel pigs. The T1 and T2, and T3 and T4 groups were intranasally challenged at approximately 26 days of age with HP-PRRSV-2 at high (106) and low (103 TCID50/ml) doses, respectively. At 7 days post-challenge, at the time of the highest viremia levels of HP-PRRSV-2, T1 and T2, and T3 and T4 groups were IM and ID injected with Diluvac Forte using needles and a need-less device (IDAL 3G, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands), respectively. Same needles or needle-less devices were used to inject the same volume of Diluvac Forte into sentinel pigs. Seroconversion of sentinels was evaluated. The results demonstrated that PP vaccinated groups (G2 and G3), regardless of the route of vaccination, had ELISA response significantly lower than G1 at 7 and 14 DPV. PP-vaccinated groups (G2 and G3) had significantly higher IFN-γ-SC and lower IL-10 secretion compared to the Ing-vaccinated group (G1). The two different MLV when administered intramuscularly demonstrated the difference in virus distribution and shedding patterns. PP-vaccinated pigs had significantly shortened viremia than the Ing-vaccinated pigs. However, ID-vaccinated pigs had lower virus distribution in organs and body fluids without virus shedding to sentinel pigs. In Exp B, regardless of the challenge dose, sentinel pigs intradermally injected with the same needle-less device used to inject challenged pigs displayed no seroconversion. In contrast, sentinel pigs intramuscularly injected with the same needle used to inject challenged pigs displayed seroconversion. The results demonstrated the transmission of PRRSV by using a needle, but not by using a needle-less device. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ID vaccination might represent an alternative to improve vaccine efficacy and safety, and may be able to reduce the shedding of vaccine viruses and reduce the iatrogenic transfer of pathogens between animals with shared needles."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the present study, a systematic investigation is performed to assess the relationship between electroplating parameters, pore morphology and internal surface area of copper deposits which are promising to serve as electrodes for electrochemical reduction reactions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ). A set of porous copper deposits are fabricated with the dynamic hydrogen bubble template method. The microstructural and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis demonstrate that current density, deposition time, and bath composition control pore size, strut size, and hence surface area which could be as high as 20 m2 /g. Selected sets of porous copper electrodes are then employed in the electrochemical reduction reaction test to determine their conversion performance in comparison to a monolithic copper surface. From the gas chromatography (GC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, porous copper is shown to provide higher rates of production of some important chemicals, as compared to copper foil electrodes. Porous copper with fern-like morphology serves as a promising electrode that yields relatively high amounts of acetaldehyde, acetate and ethanol. The study thus presents the opportunities to enhance the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 through microstructural engineering of the copper surface, which benefits both CO2 reduction and generation of chemical products of high value."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Currently, research in nanoparticles as a drug delivery system has broadened to include their use as a delivery system for bioactive substances and a diagnostic or theranostic system. Nanogels, nanoparticles containing a high amount of water, have gained attention due to their advantages of colloidal stability, core-shell structure, and adjustable structural components. These advantages provide the potential to design and fabricate multifunctional nanosystems for various biomedical applications. Modified or functionalized polymers and some metals are components that markedly enhance the features of the nanogels, such as tunable amphiphilicity, biocompatibility, stimuli-responsiveness, or sensing moieties, leading to specificity, stability, and tracking abilities. Here, we review the diverse designs of core-shell structure nanogels along with studies on the fabrication and demonstration of the responsiveness of nanogels to different stimuli, temperature, pH, reductive environment, or radiation. Furthermore, additional biomedical applications are presented to illustrate the versatility of the nanogels."

Methods: Subjects aged 40 years and older who participated in the dietary intake interview and vision health questionnaire of NHANES were included in the study. Glaucoma diagnosis by self‐report was utilized. Additionally, glaucoma diagnosis by fundus imaging and International Society Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology (ISGEO) criteria was used in subjects with available qualified retinal imaging. Survey logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between daily niacin consumption and glaucoma. Results: A total of 5768 participants were included in the study. There was a significant decrease in the crude odds of self-reported glaucoma in the third (OR 0.57, 95% Cl 0.43–0.76; p < 0.001) and fourth (OR 0.57, 95% Cl 0.37–0.90; p = 0.018) quartiles of daily niacin consumption, which equated to 21.01 to 28.22 mg/day and greater than 28.22 mg/day, respectively. A similar trend was found using fundus imaging of subjects with niacin intake in the third (OR 0.42, 95% Cl 0.25–0.72; p = 0.002) and fourth (OR 0.36, 95% Cl 0.20–0.67; p = 0.002) quartiles. After adjusting for covariates, the odds of glaucoma based on fundus imaging remained significantly lower for niacin intake in the third (OR 0.49, 95% Cl 0.28– 0.87; p = 0.016) and fourth (OR 0.48, 95% Cl 0.26–0.89; p = 0.022) quartile levels. Using ISGEO criteria, there was no significant association between glaucoma and daily niacin consumption. Conclusions: Greater niacin intake may be associated with a lower chance of developing glaucoma."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The primary objective of this research is to study ways to increase the potential of energy production from food waste by co-production of bioethanol and biomethane. In the first step, the food waste was hydrolysed with an enzyme at different concentrations. By increasing the concentration of enzyme, the amount of reducing sugar produced increased, reaching a maximum amount of 0.49 g/g food waste. After 120 h of fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nearly all reducing sugars in the hydrolysate were converted to ethanol, yielding 0.43–0.50 g ethanol/g reducing sugar, or 84.3–99.6% of theoretical yield. The solid residue from fermentation was subsequently subjected to anaerobic digestion, allowing the production of biomethane, which reached a maximum yield of 264.53 ± 2.3 mL/g VS. This results in a gross energy output of 9.57 GJ, which is considered a nearly 58% increase in total energy obtained, compared to ethanol production alone. This study shows that food waste is a raw material with high energy production potential that could be further developed into a promising energy source. Not only does this benefit energy production, but it also lowers the cost of food waste disposal, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is a sustainable energy production approach."

We evaluated the incidence and patterns of irAEs in patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in Thailand. Methods: All solid tumor patients treated with ICIs were retrospectively reviewed in a multicenter analysis. The study aims to evaluate the incidence of irAEs and their characteristics, treatments, outcomes, and impact on survival. All irAEs were graded using the CTCAE version 4.0. Characteristics of irAEs including time to onset, duration of irAEs, specific treatments, and outcomes of irAEs were reviewed. The Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare variables. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by the log-rank test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: irAEs of any grade were observed in 98 of 414 patients (24%), whereas grades 3–4 irAEs were observed in 5.6%. The majority of patients (78%) were treated with monotherapy ICI (anti-PD1/PD-L1 92%). The most common all-grade irAEs were hypothyroidism (7.5%), hepatitis (6.5%), and rash (4.8%). Median onset of overall irAEs was 63 days. Pancreatitis and pneumonitis had the earliest onset at 30 and 34 days, respectively. ICIs were rechallenged in 68 of 98 patients with irAE. Eleven of sixty-eight patients (11.2%) with initial irAE had reoccurrence after ICI rechallenge. Based on a multivariate analysis, pre-existing hypothyroidism, ICI used in a clinical trial setting, and combinations of ICI/ICI were independent factors predicting irAE occurrence. Patients with irAE had a statistically significant longer overall survival (OS) when compared to patients without irAE (p = 0.019). A multivariate analysis revealed that occurrence of irAE was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51–0.96; p = 0.028). Conclusion: irAE was commonly observed in Thai cancer patients treated with ICIs. Most irAEs were low-grade and manageable. Re-occurrence of irAE after re-challenging ICI was not uncommonly observed. Patients who experienced irAEs might have significantly longer OS compared to patients without irAEs. However, OS in this study should be interpreted with caution since it might be affected by various tumor types, treatment settings, dosing schedule, and ICI combinations."

This study was carried out at three small-scale gold mining sites situated in Banmauk Township, Myanmar and aims to assess the occupational health risks of small-scale gold miners who are exposed to arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) in the soil through the dermal route. Soil samples were analyzed through atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The concentrations of the heavy metals in soils found As, ranged 1.04 mg/kg to 22.17 mg/kg, 0.13 mg/kg to 3.07 mg/kg for Cd, 0.15 mg/kg to 77.44 mg/kg for Hg, and 7.67 mg/kg to 210.00 mg/kg for Pb. In this study, 79% of the participants did not use any form of personal protective equipment (PPE) while working in gold mining processes. Regarding noncancer risk assessment, the results found all hazard quotient were lower than acceptable level (HQ < 1). In addition, all hazard index (HI) was lover than 1, the highest HI was found as 5.66 × 10−1 in the amalgamation process. On the other hand, the result found cancer risk ranged from 8.02 × 10−8 to 1.75 × 10−6, and the estimated cancer risks for 9 years ranged from 4.78 × 10−7 to 1.04 × 10−5. Therefore, the cancer risks of the miners were greater than the United State Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) acceptable cancer risk level, 1 × 10−6, and the miners may be at risk of developing carcinogenic diseases. The suggestion is to educate miners about the health risks of heavy metals and to encourage the use of proper PPE all the time while working in gold mine."

We characterized mcr genes in the Klebsiella pneumoniae complex (KpnC) isolated from slaughtered pigs in Thailand. The 280 KpnCs consisted of K. pneumoniae (85%), Klebsiella quasipneumoniae (8.21%), and Klebsiella variicola (6.79%). mcr genes were detected in 6.79% (19/280) of KpnC isolates, consisting of mcr‐8 (n = 9; 3.21%), mcr‐7 (n = 7; 2.50%), mcr‐7 + mcr‐8 (n = 2; 0.71%), and mcr‐1 + mcr‐7 (n = 1; 0.36%). K. pneumoniae predomi-nantly carried the mcr‐7 and mcr‐8 genes, while K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae harbored mcr‐7 and mcr‐8, respectively. Six of the nineteen mcr‐harboring KpnC isolates exhibited colistin re-sistance, and five had mcr‐1 or mcr‐8 transferable to an Escherichia coli recipient. Antimicrobial susceptibility analysis revealed that all mcr‐carrying KpnC isolates were susceptible to carbapenems, cefotaxime, cefepime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, amikacin, and fosfomy-cin, and had high resistance to azithromycin. Multilocus sequence analysis demonstrated that the mcr‐harboring KpnC isolates were genetically diverse. A ‘One‐Health’ approach is useful to combat antimicrobial‐resistant bacteria through coordinating the human, animal, and environmental sec-tors. Hence, continuous monitoring and surveillance of mcr‐carrying KpnCs throughout the pork supply chain is crucial for ensuring public health."

One-pot green synthesis of AgNPs with starch/PVA using sugarcane leaf extract as the reducing substance was used to fabricate the packaging films. The incorporation of CA in the preparation of AgNPs resulted in a smaller particle size and narrower size distribution compared to that without CA. Moreover, the well-dispersed characteristic of AgNPs in the starch/PVA film was observed, resulting in the enhanced mechanical properties of the film. The synergistic effect between AgNPs and 20%CA in starch/PVA was explored against S. aureus and E. coli and showed 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate-scavenging activity.

To ensure widespread vaccination, it is crucial to analyze vaccine willingness and its determinants among physicians, key health care influencers. This study aimed to assess acceptance rate and identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among Thai physicians. Methods: A cross-sectional online-based questionnaire was distributed to all physicians at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during March 31, 2021 to April 30, 2021 in order to assess their attitudes toward receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for vaccine acceptance and refusal as well as predictors of vaccine hesitancy were analyzed by bivariate and multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 705 complete responses were received with 95.6% (n = 675) of physicians expressing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Only one of the 31 physicians (4.4%) who expressed a hesitancy or unwillingness to be vaccinated was a faculty member; the others were physicians-in-training. Approximately one-fifths of physicians surveyed were also not willing to recommend the vaccine to their family members (21.4%, n = 151) or patients (18.7%, n = 132). Using multivariable logistic regression, vaccine hesitancy was independently associated with preference for particular vaccines over the government allocated option, especially for mRNA vaccine (aOR 8.86; 95% CI 1.1–71.54; p = 0.041). Vaccine literacy showed an inverse relationship (aOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.13–0.9; p = 0.029) with vaccine hesitancy. Uncertainty of the vaccine efficacy (83.9%) and fear of adverse events (48.4%) were major concerns contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Conclusion: This study revealed a high rate of physician willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine especially among staffs; however, a significant proportion would not currently suggest vaccination to their families or patients. Restrictions on vaccine choice and vaccine illiteracy, together with concerns over adverse effects and uncertainty of efficacy, were associated with negative attitudes toward vaccination. To raise acceptance of the vaccination program, efforts should be made to balance individual preference for vaccine type in addition to increasing the availability of accurate data on safety and efficacy for each vaccine."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays crucial roles in the anterior pituitary gland via the mechanism of cell–ECM interaction. Since bisphenol A (BPA), a well-known endocrine disruptor, can cross through the placenta from mother to fetus and bind with estrogen receptors, cell popula-tions in the neonatal anterior pituitary gland could be the target cells affected by this chemical. The present study treated maternal rats with 5000 µg/kg body weight of BPA daily throughout the preg-nancy period and then investigated the changes in ECM-producing cells, i.e., pericytes and follicu-lostellate (FS) cells, including their ECM production in the neonatal anterior pituitary at Day 1. We found that pericytes and their collagen synthesis reduced, consistent with the increase in the number of FS cells that expressed several ECM regulators—matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) family. The relative MMP9/TIMP1 ratio was extremely high, indicating that the control of ECM homeostasis was unbalanced. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy showed the unorganized cell cluster in the BPA-treated group. This study revealed that although the mother received BPA at the “no observed adverse effect” level, alterations in ECM-producing cells as well as collagen and the related ECM balancing genes occurred in the neonatal anterior pituitary gland."

The roles of Notch signaling in proinflammatory macrophages are well characterized, whereas its involvement, if any, in IL-4-stimulated macrophages (M(IL-4)) is still unclear. We observed that Notch signaling is functional in human M(IL-4). We performed transcriptome analysis of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC1)-overexpressing human monocytic cell line THP-1 with or without IL-4 stimulation to understand the global impact of Notch signaling in M(IL-4). The results revealed that NIC1-overexpressing THP-1 upregulated proinflammatory-associated genes and target genes of IL-4 signaling. We identified serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) as one of the genes increased by NIC1 overexpression in M(IL-4). To dissect the signaling pathway leading to SGK1 upregulation, we pretreated THP-1-derived macrophages with specific inhibitors of Notch (DAPT), AKT (LY294002) or ERK (U0126). Among these inhibitors, only LY294002 decreased the SGK1 mRNA levels in M(IL-4), indicating that the AKT pathway plays a key role in SGK1 transcription in M(IL-4). Furthermore, treatment of THP-1-derived macrophages with the SGK1 inhibitor (GSK650394) suppressed AKT phosphorylation, but not STAT6, in response to IL-4, indicating that SGK1 positively regulates AKT pathway in M(IL-4). Finally, GSK650394 treatment of human M(IL-4) increased the levels of PPARG mRNA and its protein, indicating a negative role of SGK1 in M(IL-4) function. Overall, we report that the Notch signaling and AKT pathways cooperatively regulate SGK1 expression in M(IL-4) where SGK1, in turn, plays an important role in suppressing IL-4-induced PPARγ expression."

The observations were carried out from 2018 July to December using broad-bandB-,R-, and narrow-band H α and S ii filters. The B band traces the continuum emission from the accretion disc, the R band encompasses both the continuum emission from the accretion disc and the redshifted H α line from the broad-line region (BLR), the S ii band contains the redshifted H α emission and the H α band traces the continuum emission underneath the S ii band. All the light curves showed strong variation with a fractional root-mean-square variation of 0.132 ± 0.001 in the B band and 0.321 ± 0.001 in H α line. From cross-correlation function analysis, we obtained a delayed response of H α line emission to the opticalB-band continuum emission of $21.44^{+1.49}_{-2.11}$ d in the rest frame of the source, corresponding to a linear size of the BLR of 0.018 pc. This is consistent with previous estimates using H β. By combining the BLR size with the H α line full width at half-maximum of 6478 ± 240 km s-1 measured from a single-epoch spectrum obtained with the Subaru telescope, we derived a black hole mass of $1.96^{+0.15}_{-0.21}\times 10^8 {\rm M}_{\odot }$."

Methods and results: We enrolled a total of 200 consecutive patients with HCM over a 139-month period from 2002 to 2013. The study found that 28 patients (14% of overall patients, 51% of patients with ACS) had ACS-NOCA, and 18 patients (9% of overall patients, 86% of patients with acute MI) had MINOCA as initial clinical presentations. The highest prevalence of non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCA) in patients with HCM was found in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (100%), followed by non-STEMI (82%), and unstable angina (29%). Patients with ACS-NOCA had more frequent ventricular tachycardia and lower resting left ventricular (LV) outflow tract gradients than those with no ACS-NOCA (p < 0.05 for all). The ACS-NOCA group had a lower probability of HCM-related death compared with the no ACS-NOCA group and the significant coronary artery disease (CAD) group (p-log-rank = 0.0018). Conclusions: MINOCA or ACS-NOCA is not an uncommon initial presentation (prevalence rate 9–14%) in patients with HCM. NOCA was highly prevalent (51–86%) in patients with HCM presenting with ACS and had a favorable prognosis. Our findings highlight as a reminder that in an era of rapid reperfusion therapy, ACS in patients with HCM is not only a result of obstructive epicardial CAD, but also stems from the complex cellular mechanisms of myocardial necrosis."
"['Immunology and Allergy', 'Immunology']","Food allergy across the globe  2021 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & ImmunologyThe prevalence of food allergy (FA) is increasing in some areas of the globe, highlighting the need for better strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. In the last few decades, we have made great strides in understanding the causes and mechanisms underlying FAs, prompting guideline updates. Earlier guidelines recommended avoidance of common food allergens during pregnancy and lactation and delaying the introduction of allergenic foods in children aged between 1 and 3 years. Recent guidelines for allergy prevention recommend consumption of a healthy and diverse diet without eliminating or increasing the consumption of allergenic foods during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Early introduction of allergenic foods is recommended by most guidelines for allergy prevention after a period of exclusive breast-feedng (6 months [World Health Organization] or 4 months [European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology]). New diagnostics for FA have been developed with varied availability of these tests in different countries. Finally, the first oral immunotherapy drug for FA was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency in 2020. In this review, we will address the global prevalence of FA, our current understanding of the causes of FA, and the latest guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating FA. We will also discuss similarities and differences between FA guidelines."

All rights reserved.Increasing resistance in Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinins and their artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) partner drugs jeopardizes effective antimalarial treatment. Resistance is worst in the Greater Mekong subregion. Monitoring genetic markers of resistance can help to guide antimalarial therapy. Markers of resistance to artemisinins (PfKelch mutations), mefloquine (amplification of P. falciparum multidrug resistance-1 [PfMDR1]), and piperaquine (PfPlasmepsin2/3 amplification and specific P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter [PfCRT] mutations) were assessed in 6,722 P. falciparum samples from Vietnam, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar between 2007 and 2019. Against a high background prevalence of PfKelch mutations, PfMDR1 and PfPlasmepsin2/3 amplification closely followed regional drug pressures over time. PfPlasmepsin2/3 amplification preceded piperaquine resistance- associated PfCRT mutations in Cambodia and reached a peak prevalence of 23/28 (82%) in 2015. This declined to 57/156 (38%) after first-line treatment was changed from dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine to artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) between 2014 and 2017. The frequency of PfMDR1 amplification increased from 0/293 (0%) between 2012 and 2017 to 12/156 (8%) in 2019. Amplification of PfMDR1 and PfPlasmepsin2/3 in the same parasites was extremely rare (4/6,722 [0.06%]) and was dispersed over time. The mechanisms conferring mefloquine and piperaquine resistance may be counterbalancing. This supports the development of ASMQ plus piperaquine as a triple artemisinin combination therapy."

Second (lignocellulosic) and third (microalgae and macroalgae) generation bioethanol appear to be the most favorable renewable feedstocks to meet SDG 7 pursuance. However, several feedstock pretreatments have shown process challenges in terms of yield and product inhibitors. Microwave-assisted heating (MAH) has gained positive attention as a novel alternative method for pretreatment heating in the global community due to its numerous advantages over conventional heating. Therefore, current studies and progress in MAH pretreatment for bioethanol production are critically reviewed. The effects of different parameters on MAH pretreatment are also examined. The application of MAH pretreatment demonstrates rapid reaction exhibiting remarkable improvement in sugar recovery and fewer inhibitors over conventional heating. Despite these advanced results, certain obstacles remain to be addressed and improved until it is ready for industrial scalability. It includes understanding the interaction and relationship between the different parameters like biomass loading, catalysts, temperature, power intensity, contact time, and pressure for reactor design. Moreover, factors such as the non-thermal effect, dielectric properties of different biomass materials, and controlled temperature need to be further explored and evaluated. Thus, continuous research and development efforts on MAH pretreatment are encouraged to become commercially feasible for the applications of bioethanol production."

Due to low incidence, an individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) is underpowered to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccines increase the risks of thromboembolism and hemorrhage. Methods: We performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, medRxiv databases, and reference lists of relevant articles to identify RCTs that reported thromboembolic, hemorrhagic events, and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled thromboembolic risk related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines compared to placebo. The secondary outcomes included estimating the risks of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), venous thromboembolisms (VTE), hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death. Results: Eight RCTs of 4 vaccine platforms comprised of 195,196 participants were retrieved. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were not associated with an increased risk of overall thromboembolism (risk ratio [RR], 1.14; 95% CI [confidence interval], 0.61–2.14; I2 = 35%), ATE (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.46–2.06; I2 = 21%), VTE (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.72–2.99; I2 = 0%), hemorrhage (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.35–2.68; I2 = 0), and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.16–1.79; I2 = 0). Compared to the baseline estimated risk of these outcomes in participants administered placebos, the risk differences with vaccines were very small and not statistically significant. These findings were consistent in the subgroup analysis across 4 vaccine platforms. Conclusion: Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, hemorrhage, and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death."

In this study, we investigated the proteins related to the UPR during the senescence cell fate. Strikingly, we found that one of the critical ER-resident proteins, GRP78/BiP, was significantly altered. Here we show that GRP78 levels differentially expressed depending on non-small lung cancer subtypes. GRP78 indeed regulates the evasion of senescence in adenocarcinoma A549 cells, in which the increased GRP78 levels enable them to re-proliferate after CDDP removal. Conversely, GRP78 is downregulated in the senescence H460 cells, making them lacking senescence evasion capability. We observed that the translational regulation critically contributed to the GRP78 protein levels in CDDP-induces senescence. Furthermore, the increased GRP78 level during senescence confers resistance to senolytic drug, Bortezomib, as observed by a twofold increase in IC50 in A549 senescence cells compared to the wild-type. This observation is also consistent in the cells that have undergone genetic manipulation by transfection with pcDNA3.1(+)-GRP78/BiP plasmids and pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro containing guide RNA sequence targeting GRP78 exon 3 to induce the overexpression and downregulation of GRP78 in H460 cells, respectively.

It utilizes three indicators, namely, the Gini index and the income shares of the bottom and the top in order to calculate the values of parameters associated with the specified functional form which has a closed-form expression for the Gini index. No error minimization technique is required in order to estimate the Lorenz curve. The data on the Gini index and the income shares of four countries that have a different level of income inequality, economic, sociological, and regional backgrounds from the United Nations University-World Income Inequality Database are used to illustrate how the simple method works. The overall results indicate that the estimated Lorenz curves fit the actual observations practically well. This simple method could be useful in the situation where the availability of data on income distribution is low. However, if more data on income distribution are available, this study shows that the specified functional form could be used to directly estimate the Lorenz curve. Moreover, the estimated values of the Gini index calculated based on the specified functional form are virtually identical to their actual observations."

All rights reserved.The effects of tube potential selection with a computed tomography (CT) automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) system on radiation dose and image quality have been investigated on a Canon CT scanner. The use of different values of tube voltage for imaging, and the appropriate settings of the ATCM system, were evaluated. The custom-made phantom consisted of three sections of different sizes with inserts of various materials. It was scanned using tube potentials of 80-140 kV and different image quality ATCM settings. CTDIvol and image quality in terms of noise, contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for air, polyethylene (PE), acrylic, polyoxymethylene (POM) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) were analysed. A figure of merit (FOM) was estimated by combining CNR and CTDIvol. CTDIvol values were similar for all values of tube voltage and individual image quality ATCM settings when tube current was not restricted by the maximum value. The contrasts were independent of ATCM image quality setting, but CNR increased at the higher image quality level as image noise decreased. Both contrast and CNR decreased with increasing tube voltage for PVC and PE, but increased for POM and acrylic. PVC was the only insert material for which there was a significant improvement in contrast at lower tube potentials. FOM indicated that standard (SD = 10) and low dose (SD = 12.5) ATCM settings might be appropriate. The optimum tube voltage settings for imaging the PVC was 80-100 kV, but not for the lower contrast POM and acrylic, for which the standard tube voltage setting of 120 kV was better. The tube potential should be carefully set to gain radiological protection optimisation and keep the radiation dose as low as possible. Results indicate that 100 kV is likely to be appropriate for imaging small and medium-sized Thai patients when iodine contrast is used."

It initiates entry into human cells by binding to the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via its receptor binding domain of S1 subunit of spike protein (SARS-CoV-2-RBD). Employing neutralizing antibodies to prevent binding between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 is an effective COVID-19 therapeutic solution. Previous studies found that CC12.3 is a highly potent neutralizing antibody that was isolated from a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient, and its Fab fragment (Fab CC12.3) bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD with comparable binding affinity to ACE2. To enhance its binding affinity, we employed computational protein design to redesign all CDRs of Fab CC12.3 and molecular dynamics (MD) to validate their predicted binding affinities by the MM-GBSA method. MD results show that the predicted binding affinities of the three best designed Fabs CC12.3 (CC12.3-D02, CC12.3-D05, and CC12.3-D08) are better than those of Fab CC12.3 and ACE2. Additionally, our results suggest that enhanced binding affinities of CC12.3-D02, CC12.3-D05, and CC12.3-D08 are caused by increased SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding interactions of CDRs L1 and L3. This study redesigned neutralizing antibodies with better predicted binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2-RBD than Fab CC12.3 and ACE2. They are promising candidates as neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2."

The earthquake also resulted in the unique phenomenon of ground failure, which was known as liquefaction. Learning from the event, the liquefaction potential based on seismic ground response analysis was performed. Several site investigations including standard penetration test and seismic down-hole test in Chiang Rai Province were carried out. The next generation attenuation model was conducted to generate the ground motion for nonlinear seismic response analysis. The peak ground acceleration at the ground surface from seismic ground response analysis was used to analyze the empirical analysis of liquefaction potential. The results show that liquefaction could occur at the investigated locations during the earthquake.

The molecular detection of FeLV RNA and the DNA provirus are important for staging of the disease. However, the rapid immunochromatographic assay commonly used for antigen detection can only detect viremia at the progressive stage. In this study, nested recombinase polymerase amplification (nRPA) was developed for exogenous FeLV DNA provirus detection, and reverse transcriptase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) was developed for the detection of FeLV RNA. The approaches were validated using 108 cats with clinicopathologic abnormalities due to FeLV infection, and from 14 healthy cats in a vaccination plan. The nRPA and RT-RPA assays could rapidly amplify the FeLV template, and produced high sensitivity and specificity. The FeLV detection rate in regression cats by nRPA was increased up to 45.8% compared to the rapid immunochromatographic assay. Hence, FeLV diagnosis using nRPA and RT-RPA are rapid and easily established in low resource settings, benefiting FeLV prognosis, prevention, and control of both horizontal and vertical transmission."

RAINBOW-Asia, a bridging study with similar design to RAINBOW, aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel for advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in Asian, predominantly Chinese, patients. Methods: RAINBOW-Asia was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 32 centres in China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Adult patients (≥18 years) with metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who previously received fluoropyrimidine–platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned with a centralised interactive web response system in a 2:1 ratio to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously on days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Randomisation was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and presence of peritoneal metastases. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02898077, and has been completed. Findings: Between March 2, 2017, and June 30, 2020, 440 patients were randomly assigned to receive ramucirumab plus paclitaxel (n=294) or placebo plus paclitaxel (n=146). Median progression-free survival was 4·14 months (95% CI 3·71–4·30) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group compared with 3·15 months (2·83–4·14) in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·765, 95% CI 0·613–0·955, p=0·0184). Median overall survival was 8·71 months (95% CI 7·98–9·49) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group and 7·92 months (6·31–9·10) in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (HR 0·963, 95% CI 0·771–1·203, p=0·7426). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (159 [54%] of 293 patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group vs 56 [39%] of 145 in the placebo plus paclitaxel group), decreased white blood cell count (127 [43%] vs 42 [29%]), anaemia (46 [16%] vs 24 [17%]), hypertension (21 [7%] vs nine [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (18 [6%] vs one [<1%]).

Herein, lignin depolymerization was investigated over Ni2P catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped activated carbon (Ni2P/AC_N). The catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness co-impregnation method followed by reduction with H2 gas. The presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups on the activated carbon surface resulted in the dispersion of Ni2P particles. The good distribution and small crystal size of Ni2P significantly increased the active surface area, which enhanced both the catalytic activity and phenol selectivity. Investigations of the catalytic activity at different reaction temperatures and lignin-to-catalyst ratios using pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that the highest phenol selectivity of 80% was achieved using the Ni2P/AC_N25% catalyst. The proposed reaction mechanism involves lignin depolymerization via C–O and C–C cleavage with subsequent phenol formation by demethoxylation. Owing to its high phenol selectivity, the Ni2P/AC_N catalyst has good potential for the transformation of lignin to phenol."

The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the OBEST, a new mobile/tablet-based application in reducing weight and encouraging healthy eating behaviors and quality of life in children with obesity. The application could assist healthcare professionals to treat children and adolescents with obesity. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the hospital and school settings in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Seventy-seven children and adolescents with obesity were randomized into two groups; one received standard care combined with the OBEST application, and the other received only standard care. The outcomes were changes in weight, healthy eating behaviors, and quality of life assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) from baseline to six-month follow-up between the two groups. Results: The results showed that the intervention group reduced more body mass index (BMI) and had a higher number of participants engaging in healthy eating behaviors than the standard care group but did not reach a statistically significant level, except for less frequent consumption of fast food. The participants in the intervention group had 4.5 times higher odds of decreased engaging in fast-food consumption than the standard care group at 6 months follow-up (odds ratio, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.41 to 14.35]). There were no statistically significant changes in PedsQL scores over 6 months in between groups. Conclusions: The current study was unable to detect a significant effect of the OBEST application as an adjunct tool to the standard treatment on reducing weight in obese children and adolescents. However, the mobile application might help to increase engaging in healthy eating behaviors. Further studies with a larger sample are needed to confirm our findings.

Bacillus pasteurii bacterium in vegetative cell and bacterial spore forms were used to induce MICP in clay specimens. Untreated and treated clay specimens were tested for their mechanical properties and microstructures through unconfined compression (UC) tests, free–free resonance (FFR) tests, X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) tests. Results showed that both vegetative cells and bacterial spores can effectively enhance the strength and modulus of clays by inducing MICP to generate calcite crystals. Clays treated with vegetative cells exhibited earlier improvements in their strength than clays treated with bacterial spores due to earlier activity availability; however, the clays treated with bacterial spores exhibited greater strength improvements in the long term.

"['Parasitology', 'Infectious Diseases']","Global diversity of the gene encoding the Pfs25 protein—a Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking vaccine candidate  2021, The Author(s).Background: Vaccines against the sexual stages of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum are indispensable for controlling malaria and abrogating the spread of drug-resistant parasites. Pfs25, a surface antigen of the sexual stage of P. falciparum, is a leading candidate for transmission-blocking vaccine development. While clinical trials have reported that Pfs25-based vaccines are safe and effective in inducing transmission-blocking antibodies, the extent of the genetic diversity of Pfs25 in malaria endemic populations has rarely been studied. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the global diversity of Pfs25 in P. falciparum populations. Methods: A database of 307 Pfs25 sequences of P. falciparum was established. Population genetic analyses were performed to evaluate haplotype and nucleotide diversity, analyze haplotypic distribution patterns of Pfs25 in different geographical populations, and construct a haplotype network. Neutrality tests were conducted to determine evidence of natural selection. Homology models of the Pfs25 haplotypes were constructed, subjected to molecular dynamics (MD), and analyzed in terms of flexibility and percentages of secondary structures. Results: The Pfs25 gene of P. falciparum was found to have 11 unique haplotypes. Of these, haplotype 1 (H1) and H2, the major haplotypes, represented 70% and 22% of the population, respectively, and were dominant in Asia, whereas only H1 was dominant in Africa, Central America, and South America. Other haplotypes were rare and region-specific, resulting in unique distribution patterns in different geographical populations. The diversity in Pfs25 originated from ten single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci located in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and anchor domain. Of these, an SNP at position 392 (GGA/GCA), resulting in amino acid substitution 131 (Gly/Ala), defined the two major haplotypes. The MD results showed that the structures of H1 and H2 variants were relatively similar. Limited polymorphism in Pfs25 could likely be due to negative selection. Conclusions: The study successfully established a Pfs25 sequence database that can become an essential tool for monitoring vaccine efficacy, designing assays for detecting malaria carriers, and conducting epidemiological studies of P. falciparum. The discovery of the two major haplotypes, H1 and H2, and their conserved structures suggests that the current Pfs25-based vaccines could be used globally for malaria control.

"['Parasitology', 'Infectious Diseases']","A new cluster of rhabdovirus detected in field-caught sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) collected from southern Thailand  2021, The Author(s).Background: The distribution of phlebotomine sand flies is changing rapidly due to climate change. This issue has implications for the epidemiology of sand fly-borne diseases, especially sand fly-associated viruses. Few studies concerning sand fly-associated viruses have been conducted in Thailand. Therefore, this study aimed to perform a molecular survey of groups of pathogenic RNA viruses belonging to the Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera and family Rhabdoviridae in sand fly samples collected from southern Thailand. Methods: Sand flies were collected at two locations in Trang and Songkhla provinces of southern Thailand, and individual sand fly samples were processed for species identification and virus detection. The Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera and family Rhabdoviridae molecular determination was performed by RT-PCR, and positive samples were identified by cloning and sequencing, cell culture inoculation, and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The results presented in this study were based on the analysis of a total of 331 female sand flies. This molecular study revealed evidence of Rhabdoviridae family virus presence in Phlebotomus papatasi (3/331, 0.9%). The findings demonstrated a new cluster of rhabdovirus that was closely related to Bactrocera dorsalis sigmavirus strain BDSV.abc5 and the lineages of insect-specific Rhabdoviridae. In addition, the Bayesian tree suggested that the common ancestor of this group was the dimarhabdovirus clade. It was assumed that the virus may have switched hosts during its evolution. However, the detection of Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera using specific primers for RT-PCR was negative in the collected sand flies. Conclusions: There is limited knowledge on the genetic diversity and ecology of Rhabdoviridae in Thailand. This is the first data regarding the circulation of Rhabdoviridae in Ph. papatasi from Thailand. We found a new cluster of rhabdoviruses that was close to the new B. dorsalis sigmavirus. It is possible that there is a great deal of diversity in this family yet to be discovered, and a more extensive survey for new rhabdoviruses may uncover viruses from a wide diversity of host taxa and broaden our understanding of the relationships among the Rhabdoviridae.

Although colistin and EDTA have successful roles for eradicating biofilms, no in vitro and in vivo studies have investigated their efficacy in catheter-related biofilm infections of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae. In this study, colistin resistance was significantly reversed in both planktonic and mature biofilms of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae by a combination of colistin (0.25–1 µg/ml) with EDTA (12 mg/ml). This novel colistin-EDTA combination was also demonstrated to have potent efficacy in eradicating colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae catheter-related biofilm infections, and eliminating the risk of recurrence in vivo. Furthermore, this study revealed significant therapeutic efficacy of colistin-EDTA combination in reducing bacterial load in internal organs, lowering serum creatinine, and protecting treated mice from mortality. Altered in vivo expression of different virulence genes indicate bacterial adaptive responses to survive in hostile environments under different treatments. According to these data discovered in this study, a novel colistin-EDTA combination provides favorable efficacy and safety for successful eradication of colistin-resistant K. pneumonia catheter-related biofilm infections."

In this work, the roles of 5.56 mol% pyrrolidine were investigated for the methane hydrate formation in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics along with morphology. The results showed that pyrrolidine generally improved the thermodynamic stability of mixed methane hydrates, enhancing the formation at milder conditions than those of pure methane hydrates. To demonstrate the kinetic performance of pyrrolidine, the experiments were performed at 8 MPa and 285.2 K in a quiescent configuration. The results showed that a very short induction time and a rapid rate of hydrate formation with desirable methane uptake were achieved. In addition, a distinct methane bubble with breathing effect, assisting methane gas to interact with the bulk solution, was observed during the hydrate formation morphology. The comparative kinetic study with 5.56 mol% tetrahydrofuran (THF) was also carried out under the same driving force and the same experimental condition. Surprisingly, although THF gave a high methane uptake, pyrrolidine could give more than 10 times higher rate of hydrate formation at the same driving force; moreover, it provided a competitive rate with THF at the similar formation condition."

Here, we identified the first two N. gonorrhoeae isolates with decreased ceftriaxone susceptibility in Thailand. Among 134 N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected from Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic, Bangkok, two isolates (NG-083 and NG-091) from urethral swab in male heterosexual patients had reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MICs of 0.125 mg/L). Both were multidrug resistant and strong biofilm producers with ceftriaxone tolerance (MBEC > 128 mg/L). NG-083 and NG-091 remained susceptible to azithromycin (MIC of 1 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L, respectively). Reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone was associated with alterations in PBP2, PBP1, PorB, MtrR, and mtrR promoter region. NG-083 belonged to sequence type (ST) 7235 and NG-091 has new allele number of tbpB with new ST. Molecular docking revealed ceftriaxone weakly occupied the active site of mosaic XXXIV penicillin-binding protein 2 variant in both isolates. Molecular epidemiology results revealed that both isolates display similarities with isolates from UK, USA, and The Netherlands. These first two genetically related gonococcal isolates with decreased ceftriaxone susceptibility heralds the threat of treatment failure in Thailand, and importance of careful surveillance."

To control water quality, a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is employed in worldwide. In RAS, water quality is achieved by nitrification biofilter treatment, whereas disease prevention is achieved by the application of an oxidizing agent such as ozone (O3). This study investigates the proper residual ozone concentration (ROC) dosage for controlling pathogenic bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) and minimizing mal-effects on nitrifying bacteria activity in the biofilter media inside an RAS. Juvenile Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vammanei, were cultured for 4 months in a lab-scale brackish RAS integrated with ozonation. Results showed that although the system biofilter's nitrification activity was influenced by ROC, the 0.3 mg L−1 ROC dosage provided an optimum condition which effectively eliminated VP in the biofilter but did not inhibit ammonia removal. At a higher ROC (approximately 0.4 mg L−1) ozonation dosage, the biofilter's ammonia oxidation rate significantly reduced. Over a 40-day shrimp-rearing operational period, the viable VP count in an aerated (non-ozonated RAS) gradually increased, but the viable VP counts in both biofilm and water in a 0.3 mg L−1 ROC treated RAS significantly reduced down to undetectable levels. As such, the conclusion was drawn that a 0.3 mg L−1 ROC ozonation treatment in the biofilter tank of a RAS can effectively control VP pathogens without influencing the activity of the nitrification biofilter, thus providing a balanced control between water quality and safety to the shrimp."
['Multidisciplinary'],"The chemotherapeutic drug carboplatin affects macrophage responses to LPS and LPS tolerance via epigenetic modifications  2021, The Author(s).Following re-exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages exhibit an immunosuppressive state known as LPS tolerance, which is characterized by repressed proinflammatory cytokine production. LPS-induced tolerance in macrophages is mediated in part by epigenetic changes. Carboplatin, an anticancer chemotherapeutic drug, exerts its effect by inhibiting DNA replication and transcription, as well as through epigenetic modifications. Through an unbiased screen, we found that carboplatin rescued TNF-α and IL-6 production in LPS-tolerant macrophages. Transcriptomic analysis and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that p53 was one of the most significantly upregulated hallmarks in both LPS-primed and LPS-tolerant macrophages in the presence of carboplatin, while E2F and G2/M were the most negatively regulated hallmarks. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1-α), which is associated with gene silencing, was significantly reduced in carboplatin-treated LPS-tolerant macrophages at the mRNA and protein levels. Dynamic changes in the mRNA level of genes encoding H3K9me3 methyltransferases, setdb2, kdm4d, and suv39h1 were induced in the presence of carboplatin in LPS-tolerant macrophages. Taken together, we provide evidence that carboplatin treatment interferes with proinflammatory cytokine production during the acute LPS response and LPS tolerance in macrophages, possibly via H3K9me3 modification."

The study aimed to examine factors relevant to optimal frequency of Antenatal Care (ANC) visits in Indonesia using the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey 2017 data. Our study outcome was optimal numbers of ANC visits (≥ 8 visits). Predictors include age, had pregnancy termination, number of children, education level, employment status, awareness of pregnancy problems, wealth index, residence, region, health insurance coverage, and barriers to reach healthcare facilities. Of 3738 participants, about 60.2% had optimal number of ANC visits. There was an association between optimal ANC utilization and: experiencing pregnancy complications, distance to the healthcare facility, health insurance coverage, residence, region, awareness of pregnancy problems, and the number of children. Policymakers should improve healthcare facilities’ availability, expand health insurance coverage, and educate women about the importance of ANC.

Initially described in working age men, a common approach to detect CKDu that includes all adults has recently been proposed. We determined the prevalence, and risk factors for CKDu using data from a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of the adult population of Thailand. We used a proxy for CKDu as age < 70 with impaired kidney function (eGFR < 60) in the absence of diabetes and hypertension (CKDu1) and heavy proteinuria (CKDu2). Prevalence estimates were probability-weighted for the Thai population. The associations between risk factors and CKDu or elderly subjects with eGFR < 60 without traditional causes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. Of 17,329 subjects, the prevalence were: eGFR < 60, 5.3%; CKDu1 0.78%; CKDu2, 0.75%. CKDu differed by 4.3-folds between regions. Women, farmers/laborers, older age, gout, painkillers, rural area, and stones were independent risk factors for CKDu. Women, age, rural, gout, painkillers were significant risk factors for both CKDu and elderly subjects. These data collected using standardized methodology showed that the prevalence of CKDu in Thailand was low overall, although some regions had higher risk. Unlike other countries, Thai women had a two-fold higher risk of CKDu."

Sponge and Its Associated Microorganisms Containing Cytotoxic Substances  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Extraction of high quantity and quality DNAs from marine sponges, which contain diverse and abundant microbial communities, is important to molecular biology techniques for the analysis of nucleic acids. Several marine sponges and their associated microorganisms have been known to produce cytotoxic natural products on several cancer cell lines via DNA damage mechanisms. These marine cytotoxic substances might be one of the factors that cause the low quantity and quality of DNAs during the DNA extraction from its living origin. Therefore, the extraction of DNA of a Thai blue marine sponge Xestospongia sp. with sufficient purity and quantity for molecular study can be challenging. In this study, we developed an efficient extraction method to prepare DNAs from a Thai blue marine sponge Xestospongia sp. which accumulated a highly potent cytotoxic alkaloid with DNA-damaging activity, named Renieramycin M (RM), as a major constituent in high quantity. We demonstrated that removal of RM from the sponge samples by a simple methanolic extraction before DNA extraction dramatically increased the yield and purity of DNAs compared to the RM-unremoved sponge samples. High molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA was obtained from sponge samples with 8 times of RM elimination by using modified NaOAc salting-out extraction method. The quantity and quality of the prepared DNAs were comparatively determined via spectrophotometry, electrophoresis, and 16S rRNA gene amplification. Our result suggests that the removal of DNA-damaging constituents from the samples is a crucial step and must be seriously taken as the necessary consideration for the practical protocol of DNA extraction."

In the current study, the antibacterial activity of gold nanoparticles has been evaluated on selected human pathogens. Methods: In this study, we used panchagavya (PG) to synthesize gold nanoparticles, and the resulting nanoparticles (PG-AuNPs) were characterized by several spectroscopic techniques. In addition, antibacterial activity of PG-AuNPs against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied by well diffusion method. Results: The synthesis of AuNPs was affirmed by a colour change, which was further validated by UV–vis spectra with a maximum absorption peak at 527 nm. Bandgap energy was calculated as 2.13 eV by Tauc method from the UV result. The presence of amino acids and proteins in PG was responsible for the conversion of gold ions to AuNPs, according to FTIR analysis. (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystallographic planes were observed by XRD; further crystalline nature was validated by SAED analysis. The size and zeta value were found to be 53.29 nm and -9.8 mV respectively. Spherical shaped nanoparticles and elemental structure of PG-AuNPs were confirmed by HRTEM and EDS analysis. The antibacterial activity of PG-AuNPs showed the maximum and minimum zone of inhibition against K. pneumoniae (17.12 ± 0.14 mm) and B. subtilis (11.42 ± 0.58 mm). Conclusion: Antibacterial activity of PG-AuNPs was found to be strong against gram negative bacteria and moderate against gram positive bacteria. Based on the result, it was concluded that PG-AuNPs could be used to combat antibiotic drug resistance. Besides, in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies of PG-AuNPs should be conducted."

Weedy rice, particularly paddy seed, is difficult to handle and separate because it has characteristics (morphological likeness) similar to those cultivated rice. This report describes a modification of self-organizing maps (SOMs) for categorizing weedy rice from cultivated rice using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) on paddy seed in situ. The sample pretreatment was performed using a cyclone vacuum machine to remove the contaminated particles and other impurities. Optical microscope and thermogravimetric analysis were employed to evaluate the physical properties and thermal behavior of rice sample, respectively. For direct sample analysis, a near-infrared spectroscopy with a reflectance attachment was used. To show the relevant NIR regions, the obtained NIR spectra were smoothed using the Savitzky–Golay polynomial, baseline-aligned using the standard normal variate, and mean-centered; in addition, the second derivative was determined. SOMs were well-optimized and applied for the classification of weedy samples from four cultivated rice. To generate a robust prediction, the predictive modeling was generated from 100 different training and test set split. The results achieved a very high predictive value in the range of 91–99% for precision and 88–99% for accuracy of the test samples, respectively."

Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Cellular senescence is an aging-related process found in cancer cells that contributes to irreversible growth arrest and tumor aggressiveness. Recently, calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3 (CAMSAP3), a minus-end microtubule-stabilizing protein, has received increasing attention in cancer cell biology. However, the biological role of CAMSAP3 on senescence in human lung cancer remains incompletely understood. Methods: The function of CAMSAP3 on the regulation of cellular senescence-associated phenotypes in human non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells were determined in CAMSAP3 deletion (H460/C3ko) cells. The effects of CAMSAP3 on cell proliferation were investigated using MTT and colony formation assays. The cell cycle activity was evaluated by flow cytometry and the senescence-associated phenotypes were observed by SA-β-Gal staining. Quantitative RT-PCR and westen blot were used to evaluate the expression of cell cycle and senescence markers. Moreover, the interaction of CAMSAP3-ERK1/2 and possible partner protein was quantified using immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence. Lastly, an xenograft model were performed. Results: CAMSAP3 knockout promotes lung cancer cell senescence-associated phenotypes and induces G1 cell cycle arrest. Mechanistic investigation revealed that phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) was markedly downregulated in CAMSAP3-deleted cells, suppressing cyclin D1 expression levels, and full-length CAMSAP3 abrogated these phenotypes. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, is required as a scaffold for CAMSAP3-modulating ERK signaling. Furthermore, an in vivo tumor xenograft experiment showed that tumor initiation is potentially delayed in CAMSAP3 knockout tumors with the downregulation of p-ERK and cyclin D1, resulting in a senescence-like phenotype. Conclusion: This study is the first to report an intriguing role of CAMSAP3 in lung carcinoma cell senescence-associated phenotypes via the modulation of p-ERK/cyclin D1 signaling."

The effect of mutations on its structure and function are however poorly characterized. Methods: Database search identified nonsense and missense mutations in the N-terminal TPR motifs and the C-terminal, catalytic JmjC domain, but also in the intrinsically disordered region connecting both these two well-structured domains. KDM6A variants with cancer-derived mutations were generated using site directed mutagenesis and fused to eGFP serving as an all-in-one affinity and fluorescence tag to study demethylase activity by an ELISA-based assay in vitro, apoptosis by FACS, complex assembly by Co-immunoprecipitation and localization by microscopy in urothelial cells and apoptosis by FACS. Results: Independent of the mutation and demethylase activity, all KDM6A variants were detectable in the nucleus. Truncated KDM6A variants displayed changes in complex assemblies affecting (1) known interactions with the COMPASS complex component RBBP5 and (2) KDM6A-DNA associated assemblies with the nuclear protein Nucleophosmin. Some KDM6A variants induced a severe cellular phenotype characterized by multiple acute effects on nuclear integrity, namely, release of nuclear DNA into the cytoplasm, increased level of DNA damage indicators RAD51 and p-γH2A.X, and mitosis defects. These damaging effects were correlated with increased cell death. Conclusion: These observations reveal novel effects of pathogenic variants pointing at new specific functions of KDM6A variants. The underlying mechanisms and affected pathways have to be investigated in future research to understand how tumor cells cope with and benefit from KDM6A truncations."

Purpose: This study aimed to (1) gather the available published pharmacokinetic studies conducted in septic patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and (2) to define the optimal imipenem dosing regimens in these populations via Monte Carlo simulations. Methods: The databases of PubMed, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched from inception to May 2020. We used the Medical Subject Headings of “Imipenem,” “CRRT,” and “pharmacokinetics” or related terms or synonym to identify the studies for systematic reviews. A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model was conducted to predict imipenem levels for the initial 48 h of therapy. The pharmacodynamic target was 40% of free drug level above 4 times of the MIC (40% fT > 4 MIC). The dose that achieved at least 90% of the probability of target attainment was defined as an optimal dose. Results: Eleven articles were identified and included for our systematic review. The necessary pharmacokinetic parameters such as the volume of distribution and the CRRT clearance were mentioned in 100 and 90.9%, respectively. None of the current studies reported the complete necessary parameters. A regimen of 750 mg q 6 h was the optimal dose for the predilution-CVVH and CVVHD modality with two effluent rates (25 and 35 mL/kg/h) for the pharmacodynamic target of 40% fT > 4MIC. Conclusions: None of the current studies showed the complete necessary pharmacokinetic parameters for drug dosing. Pharmacodynamic target significantly contributed to imipenem dosing regimens in these patients. Different effluent rates and types of CRRT had minimal impact on dosing regimens.

It has been hypothesized that due to increased survival chances, preparedness to instantly acquire fear towards evolutionary threats has been hardwired into neural pathways of the primate brain. Here, we compare participants’ fear of snakes according to experience; from those who often deal with snakes and even suffer snakebites to those unfamiliar with snakes. Methods: The Snake Questionnaire-12 (SNAQ-12) and Specific Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ) were administered to three groups of participants with a different level of experience with snakes and snakebites: 1) snake experts, 2) firefighters, and 3) college students. Results: This study shows that individuals more experienced with snakes demonstrate lower fear. Moreover, participants who have suffered a snakebite (either venomous or not) score lower on fear of snakes (SNAQ-12), but not of all other potentially phobic stimuli (SPQ). Conclusions: Our results suggest that a harmless benign exposure might immunize people to highly biologically prepared fears of evolutionary threats, such as snakes."

Yet, recent studies have not well stated the safety profiles which remained poor-understood and dispersed. We hence performed systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the adverse outcomes of SDD in comparison with an overnight stay. Methods: Databases were searched through January 2021. Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using random-effects, generic inverse variance method of der Simonian and Laird. The primary outcomes included total cumulative complications and immediate complications following AF ablation. Results: Ten observational studies were met our inclusion criteria, comprising of total population of 11,660 patients, with SDD 51.3%. For total cumulative complications, there were no differences observed between SDD and overnight stay (5.2% vs. 6.2%: pooled OR 0.77: 95% CI 0.55–1.08, p =.13 with I2 = 27.1%). In addition, comparable immediate complications were also demonstrated (5.2 % vs. 4.3: pooled OR 1.08: 95% CI 0.72–1.62, p =.718, with I2 = 37.3 %). Conclusion: Our study suggested that SDD had similar complication rates, both total cumulative and immediate outcomes, compared with overnight stay in selected patients following AF ablation. Nevertheless, randomized control trials are warranted to validate the findings."
"['Health (social science)', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","Payment mechanism and hospital admission: New evidence from Thailand healthcare reform  2021 Elsevier LtdIn 2007, Thailand's Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), one of the three main public health insurers, adopted a new payment mechanism for hospital admission. There has been a shift from fee-for-service toward Diagnostic Related Group (DRG)-based payment that transfers financial risk from the government to health care providers. This study investigates the effects of this policy change on hospital admission, frequency of admission, length of stay (LOS), type of hospital admitted, and out-of-pocket (OOP) inpatient medical expenditure. By employing nationally representative micro-level data (Health and Welfare surveys) and difference-in-difference approach, this study finds a 1 percentage point decline in hospitalization, a 10% higher chance of admission at community hospitals (the lowest level inpatient public health care facility), and a 7% less chance of admission at higher level public health care facilities like general hospitals. No significant change was observed in LOS, frequency of admission, or OOP inpatient medical expenditure associated with the post-2007 payment mechanism change. Our results emphasize the effectiveness of a close-ended payment mechanism for health care in developing countries. This study also adds to the limited literature on using micro-level data to investigate payment mechanism change in the context of low- and middle-income countries."

However, the involvement of β-adrenergic signaling by this compound has never been elucidated. The objectives of this study were to investigate the underlying mechanisms of β-CTX as a β-blocker and its association with the β-adrenergic pathway. The effects of β-CTX on isolated cardiac myocyte functions, calcium homeostasis, the phosphorylation level of targeted proteins, and the myofibrillar ATPase activity were studied. Healthy Sprague Dawley rats were used for cardiomyocytes isolation. Like propranolol, β-CTX attenuated the cardiomyocyte inotropy and calcium transient alterations as induced by isoproterenol stimulation. In contrast, these effects were not observed in forskolin-treated cells. Interestingly, cardiomyocytes treated with β-CTX showed no changes in phosphorylation level at any PKA-targeted sites in the myofilaments as demonstrated in Western blot analysis. The skinned fibers study revealed no change in myofilament kinetics by β-CTX. However, this protein exhibited the direct inhibition of myofibrillar ATPase activity with calcium de-sensitization of the enzyme. In summary, the negative inotropic mechanism of β-CTX was discovered. β-CTX exhibits an atypical β-blocker mechanism.

We assessed recruitment at such substrate types at Koh Tao, Gulf of Thailand, and compared the community structure of scleractinian corals between artificial substrates and nearby natural reefs. Our results from a sample of 2677 recruits from nine sites highlighted significant differences in community structure between both reef types. Investigations of variables including time since deployment, distance from the natural reef, and seafloor depth revealed only the latter as a possible influencing factor. The diversity of recruits could not be explained by dynamics in coral spawning, and were found to represent groups with lower structural complexity. Our results suggest that coral community structure on artificial and natural reefs differs and supports distinct ecological and functional roles."

Despite modern medical and device therapies, 60–70% of HF patients still die within 5 years of diagnosis as it relentlessly progresses through pervasive apoptotic loss of cardiomyocytes. Although fortilin, a 172-amino-acid anti-p53 molecule, is one of the most expressed proteins in the heart, its precise role there has remained unknown. Also unclear is how cardiomyocytes are protected against apoptosis. Here, we report that failing human hearts express less fortilin than do non-failing hearts. We also found that mice lacking fortilin in the heart (fortilinKO-heart) die by 9 weeks of age due to extensive cardiomyocyte apoptosis and severe HF, which suggests that fortilin sustains cardiomyocyte viability. The lack of fortilin is also associated with drastic upregulation of p53 target genes in the hearts. The heart-specific deletion of p53 in fortilinKO-heart mice extends their life spans from 9 to 18 weeks by mitigating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Our data suggest that fortilin is a novel cardiac p53 inhibitor and that its inadequate expression in failing hearts and subsequent overactivation of the p53 apoptosis pathway in cardiomyocytes exacerbates HF."

In the present work, a 1D TiO2 based photoanode was enhanced by BiVO4 (BVO). All TiO2 and BVO/TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated by a hydrothermal method. Structural and surface morphology of the thin films were characterized by various spectroscopies. The 1D TiO2 and BVO/TiO2 nanorods were well aligned perpendicular to the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) revealed BVO formation on the TiO2 surface, which was in agreement with the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results. The bandgap of the TiO2 photoanode was decreased due to the BVO enhancement. According to UV–visible spectroscopy and the valence band binding energy from XPS, the estimated bandgap of BVO/TiO2 was 2.8 eV, while pure TiO2 was 3.1 eV. Based on this result, the PEC comprised of a BVO/TiO2 photoanode can harvest visible light. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to reveal the underlying physical properties when the PEC was operated. Upon illumination with a solar simulator, most of the PECs comprised of a BVO/TiO2 photoanode exhibited greater performance than the PECs comprised of a pristine TiO2 photoanode. The significant increase in performance was due to the light absorption extension to the visible region and the BVO anchoring, which leads to a low internal charge carrier resistance of the TiO2 based photoanode."

Previous retrospective studies reported that EUS-FNA is feasible on peritoneal and omental lesions, however, EUS-FNA provided a limited amount of tissue for immunohistochemistry stain (IHC). Aim: This pilot study aims to prospectively determine the effectiveness of EUS-FNB regarding adequacy of tissue for IHC staining, diagnostic rate and the avoidance rate of diagnostic laparoscopy or percutaneous biopsy in patients with these lesions. Methods: From March 2017 to June 2018, patients with peritoneal or omental lesions identified by CT or MRI at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were prospectively enrolled in the study. All Patients underwent EUS-FNB. For those with negative pathological results of EUS-FNB, percutaneous biopsy or diagnostic laparoscopy was planned. Analysis uses percentages only due to small sample sizes. Results: A total of 30 EUS-FNB passes were completed, with a median of 3 passes (range 2–3 passes) per case. For EUS-FNB, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of EUS-FNB from peritoneal lesions were 63.6%, 100%, 100%, 20% and 66.7% respectively. Adequate tissue for IHC stain was found in 25/30 passes (80%). The tissues from EUS results were found malignant in 7/12 patients (58.3%). IHC could be done in 10/12 patients (83.3%). Among the five patients with negative EUS results, two underwent either liver biopsy of mass or abdominal paracentesis, showing gallbladder cancer and adenocarcinoma. Two patients refused laparoscopy due to advanced pancreatic cancer and worsening ovarian cancer. The fifth patient had post-surgical inflammation only with spontaneous resolution. The avoidance rate of laparoscopic diagnosis was 58.3%. No major adverse event was observed. Conclusions: EUS-FNB from peritoneal lesions provided sufficient core tissue for diagnosis and IHC. Diagnostic laparoscopy can often be avoided in patients with peritoneal lesions."

Core annular technique has been applied in industry for transporting heavy oil via pipelines to considerably reduce pressure drop. Several studies have been conducted related to oil-water core annular flow (CAF) within pipelines. However, limited works are found in cases of CAF in widely used T and Y-shaped junction pipes which have important roles for dividing or combining the flow. In this study, a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach was applied to simulate the high viscous oil-water CAF through T and Y-shaped junction pipe configurations. The 2k factorial statistical experimental design was applied to investigate the effect of pipe diameter and junction angle on the flow performance through T and Y-shaped junction pipes. Eight cases were run with different junction pipe configuration combinations. By applying the factorial designs method, all possible combinations of factors were able to be investigated with lowest numbers of simulation run. The selected response variables of the flow system were the average values of oil hold up and pressure gradient as well as the standard deviation of pressure from inlet to outlets of pipes. It was observed that the stability of CAF was not achieved at the downstream region. The flow transformed into stratified and slug flow. The most attractive design was measured by the small average of pressure gradient and standard deviation of pressure but with a high value of oil holdup. The T-shaped pipe with smaller inlet diameter combined with larger outlet diameter showed the most considerable effect for a better flow performance."

This study aimed to examine the action of various HDX forms in preventing a tight junction (TJ) barrier disruption induced by TNF-α or IL-1β through the inhibition of p-MLC expression in Caco-2 cell model. TJ barrier function was determined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and flux measurement of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4). 1-monoHDX or 1,3-diHDX (10 μM) promoted TER but not FD-4 permeability in the absence of cytokines. Pretreatment with 1-monoHDX at 10 μM for 24 h prevented TNF-α or IL-1β effect on TJ permeability. p-MLC protein expression by Western blot analysis, which was induced by IL-1β was inhibited with all HDXs. Tricyclic scaffold as the basic skeleton of all HDXs may be a potential candidate therapeutic for treatment of diseases-related leaky gut."

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Co-production is a process based on the biorefinery concept that maximizes the benefit of biomass by reusing residue from the production of one product to produce others. In this regard, biogas is one of the most researched second products for the production of ethanol from cellulosic biomass. However, operating this scheme requires additional investment in biogas processing equipment. This review compiles data from research studies on the co-production of bioethanol and biogas from lignocellulosic biomass to determine which is more worthwhile: leaving the residue or investing more to benefit from the second product. According to previous research, ethanol stillage can be converted to biogas via anaerobic digestion, increasing energy output by 2–3 fold. Techno-economic studies demonstrated that the co-production process reduces the minimum ethanol selling price to a level close to the market price of ethanol, implying the possibility of industrializing cellulosic ethanol production through this scheme."

We sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the Orsiro SES in unselected Thai population. Methods: The Thailand Orsiro registry was a prospective, open-label clinical study evaluating all patients with obstructive coronary artery disease implanted with Orsiro SES. The primary endpoint was target lesion failure (TLF) at 12 months. TLF is defined as a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (TVMI), emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR). Patients with diabetes, small vessels (≤ 2.75 mm), chronic total occlusions (CTOs), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were pre-specified subgroups for statistical analysis. Result: A total of 150 patients with 235 lesions were included in the analysis. Half of the patients (53.3%) presented with AMI, and 24% had diabetes. Among 235 lesions, 93(39.4%) were small vessels, and 24(10.2%) were chronic total occlusions. The primary endpoint, TLF at 12 months, occurred in eight patients (5.3%), predominately caused by cardiac death. By contrast, the incidences of TVMI and CD-TLR were null. The outcomes in pre-specified subgroup were not different from the overall population (all p > 0.05). One definite late stent thrombosis(0.7%) was incidentally observed during primary percutaneous coronary intervention to the non-target vessel. Conclusion: The safety and efficacy of the ultrathin strut sirolimus-eluting stent in unselected cases are confirmed in the Thailand Orsiro registry. Despite the high proportion of pre-specified high-risk subgroups, the excellent stent performance was consistent with the overall population. Trial Registration TCTR20190325001."

With the emergence of new variants, there is a corresponding decrease in the currently available vaccine efficacy, highlighting the need for greater insights into the viral epitope profile for both vaccine design and assessment. In this study, three immunodominant linear B cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) were identified by immunoinformatics prediction, and confirmed by ELISA with sera from Macaca fascicularis vaccinated with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine. Further immunoinformatics analyses of these three epitopes gave rise to a method of linear B cell epitope prediction and selection. B cell epitopes in the spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins were subsequently predicted and confirmed using convalescent sera from COVID-19 infected patients. Immunodominant epitopes were identified in three regions of the S2 domain, one region at the S1/S2 cleavage site and one region at the C-terminus of the M protein. Epitope mapping revealed that most of the amino acid changes found in variants of concern are located within B cell epitopes in the NTD, RBD, and S1/S2 cleavage site. This work provides insights into B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 as well as immunoinformatics methods for B cell epitope prediction, which will improve and enhance SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development against emergent variants."

Oxygen therapy possibly affects the timing of swallows, which may alter airway protective mechanisms. Objectives: To compare the coordination between swallowing and respiration during water infusion in post-extubation patients using high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) with the coordination in those using low flow nasal oxygen (LFNO). Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled crossover study in post-extubation patients. The patients extubated within 48 h were randomly assigned to two groups, namely, HFNO and LFNO. The eligible patients in each group received either HFNO with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.35, flow 50 L per minute (LPM), and temperature 34 °C or LFNO 5 LPM for 5 min. The coordination between swallowing and respiration was observed during continuous infusion of 10-ml water one minute three times. Respiratory phases and swallowing were monitored using electrocardiogram (EKG)-derived respiratory signals and submental electromyography (EMG), respectively. The swallowing frequency and timing of swallows in relation to respiratory phases were recorded. The coordination between swallowing and respiration was classified into 4 patterns, namely I, E, I-E, and E-I swallows. (I; inspiration and E; expiration) Subsequently, after a 5-min washout period, the patients were switched to the other type of oxygen therapy using the same procedure. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 22 patients with a mean age of 56 years were enrolled in the study. The major indication for invasive mechanical ventilation was pneumonia with a median duration of endotracheal intubation of 2.5 days. The median total swallowing numbers (three minutes) were 18.5 times in the HFNO period and 21 times in the LFNO period (p = NS). The most common swallowing pattern was E-swallow. The patients using HFNO had higher numbers of E-swallow pattern (74.3% in HFNO vs 67.6% in LFNO; p = 0.048) and lower numbers of I-swallow pattern (14.3% in HFNO vs 23.1% in LFNO; p = 0.044). The numbers of other swallowing patterns were not different between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Compared with LFNO, HFNO significantly increased the E-swallow and decreased the I-swallow in post-extubation patients. The findings indicated that HFNO might reduce a risk of aspiration during the post-extubation period. Clinical trial No.: Thai clinical trial TCTR20200206004 Registered February 4, 2020.

"['Chemical Engineering (all)', 'Mechanics of Materials']","Scale-up and flow behavior of cohesive granular material in a four-bladed mixer: effect of system and particle size  2021 The Society of Powder Technology JapanFlow of cohesive granular materials with different moisture contents was examined in a four-bladed mixer via the discrete element method (DEM). Firstly, the mixer diameter (D) was increased while keeping the particle diameter (d) constant. It was observed that when the mixer diameter to the particle diameter ratio (D/d) was larger than a certain critical size (D/d ≥ 75), granular flow behaviors and mixing kinetics followed simple scaling relations. For D/d ≥ 75, flow patterns and mixing kinetics were found to be independent of system size, and velocities of particles scaled linearly with the tip speed of the impeller blades and particle diffusivities scaled with the tip speed of the blades and mixer diameter. These results suggest that past a certain system size the flow and mixing of cohesive particles in large-scale units can be predicted from smaller systems. Secondly, system size was kept constant and particle diameter was changed and it was observed that by keeping the Bond number constant (by changing the level of cohesion) the flow behavior and mixing patterns did not change, showing that larger particles can be used to simulate flow of smaller cohesive particles in a bladed mixer by matching the Bond numbers."

This study aims to evaluate early treatment with estradiol valerate on bone turnover markers after surgically induced menopause. Methods: This prospective study included 41 pre and perimenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy with oophorectomy for benign gynecologic conditions. Two weeks after the operation, all participants were assessed for menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) indications. Estrogen therapy was prescribed for those who had indications and accepted treatment (hormone treatment group). The others who had no MHT indication were allocated to the no-treatment group. Serum CTX and P1NP levels at preoperative and 12 weeks postoperative were measured and set as the primary outcome. Within the same group, serum CTX and P1NP before and after surgical menopause were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. ANCOVA was used to compare serum CTX and P1NP at 12 weeks after surgical menopause between the two groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis analyzed the correlation between age and baseline bone turnover markers. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: At 12 weeks after surgery, there were no significant differences in serum CTX and P1NP levels in the hormone treatment group compared to baseline. In contrast, serum CTX and P1NP levels were significantly elevated among women who did not receive hormone treatment (p-value < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Serum CTX and P1NP at 12 weeks were significantly different between the two groups (p-value < 0.001 and 0.004, respectively).

Herein, lignosulfonate-graft-poly[acrylamide-co-(acrylic acid)], LS-g-P(AAm-co-AA) microgels are synthesized by inverse suspension, a well-known and practical industrial process. Taking advantage of a chain transfer reaction with lignosulfonate (LS), no modification of lignin is therefore required. LS is confirmed to incorporate in the microgels as evidenced by elemental analysis, FTIR, DOSY 1H NMR, and XPS spectroscopies. Microgel particles with a high percent LS grafting are obtained by decreasing the monomer concentration in the disperse phase. Additionally, the LS-g-P(AAm-co-AA) microgels containing LS promote thermal stability and render the faster and stronger methylene blue (MB) adsorption. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms understudy indicate that the adsorption behavior of MB on the microgels follows the pseudo-second order and Langmuir model. It is found that the LS-g-P(AAm-co-AA) microgels can take up MB with 154 mg g−1 of adsorption capacity. More importantly, the LS-g-P(AAm-co-AA) microgels can be degraded by laccase enzyme derived by fungi in nature."
"['Biotechnology', 'Genetics']","Comprehensive genome-wide analysis of calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) in Durio zibethinus and identification of fruit ripening-associated DzCAMTAs  2021, The Author(s).Background: Fruit ripening is an intricate developmental process driven by a highly coordinated action of complex hormonal networks. Ethylene is considered as the main phytohormone that regulates the ripening of climacteric fruits. Concomitantly, several ethylene-responsive transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal components of the regulatory network underlying fruit ripening. Calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) is one such ethylene-induced TF implicated in various stress and plant developmental processes. Results: Our comprehensive analysis of the CAMTA gene family in Durio zibethinus (durian, Dz) identified 10 CAMTAs with conserved domains. Phylogenetic analysis of DzCAMTAs, positioned DzCAMTA3 with its tomato ortholog that has already been validated for its role in the fruit ripening process through ethylene-mediated signaling. Furthermore, the transcriptome-wide analysis revealed DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 as the highest expressing durian CAMTA genes. These two DzCAMTAs possessed a distinct ripening-associated expression pattern during post-harvest ripening in Monthong, a durian cultivar native to Thailand. The expression profiling of DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 under natural ripening conditions and ethylene-induced/delayed ripening conditions substantiated their roles as ethylene-induced transcriptional activators of ripening. Similarly, auxin-suppressed expression of DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 confirmed their responsiveness to exogenous auxin treatment in a time-dependent manner. Accordingly, we propose that DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 synergistically crosstalk with ethylene during durian fruit ripening. In contrast, DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 antagonistically with auxin could affect the post-harvest ripening process in durian. Furthermore, DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 interacting genes contain significant CAMTA recognition motifs and regulated several pivotal fruit-ripening-associated pathways. Conclusion: Taken together, the present study contributes to an in-depth understanding of the structure and probable function of CAMTA genes in the post-harvest ripening of durian."

Our hypothesis is curcumin regulates the expression of wound healing-related genes in human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs). This study investigated whether curcumin regulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, type I TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRI), type II TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRII), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in unwounded hGFs and an in vitro hGF wound healing model. Methods: The cytotoxicity of curcumin was evaluated using the MTT assay. Unwounded hGFs were treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of curcumin for 24 h. Gene expression was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Then, hGFs were treated with 1 µM curcumin in an in vitro wound healing model. PD98059 pretreatment was performed to determine whether extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling was required for regulation of gene expression by curcumin. Results: Curcumin at 0.1–20 µM caused no significant change in cell viability. In unwounded hGFs, curcumin had no significant effect on TGF-β1, TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, or VEGF expression. Conversely, curcumin significantly upregulated the expression of these genes in the in vitro wound healing model. PD98059 significantly attenuated the curcumin-stimulated TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, and VEGF expression, whereas it had no effect on TGF-β1 expression. Conclusions: Curcumin upregulated TGF-β1, TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, and VEGF expression in an in vitro hGF wound healing model. The ERK pathway is required for TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, and VEGF induction by curcumin. Our findings support the development of curcumin as a therapeutic agent for gingival ulcers."

One difficulty in the engineering design and construction of rockfill dams is the characterisation of the rockfill materials. Thanks to advancements in computational geomechanics, a finite element analysis is usually employed in geotechnical engineering design. To perform such analyses, a proper constitutive model with relevant parameters that reflect the stress–strain-strength characteristics of rockfill materials are required. This study presents a procedure to determine the strength and stiffness parameters of rockfill materials that can be used with the Hardening Soil (HS) model to characterise the behaviour of rockfill materials. Based on triaxial and oedometer test results, a set of HS model parameters can be determined. To implement and validate the procedure, six rockfill materials from the Nam Ngum 2 Dam construction project in Laos PDR are employed in this study. The influences of stress level and particle breakage on the stress–strain/volumetric-strain behaviours of rockfill materials are discussed. Finally, the procedure to determine the material parameters for rockfill materials presented in this study can also be applied to other rockfill materials."

Its sequelae, such as blindness, persist even after recovery. Patients with SJS/TEN should be accurately diagnosed and receive appropriate treatment as soon as possible. Therefore, identifying the factors for severity prediction is necessary. We aimed to clarify the clinical parameters and biological markers that can predict acute severe ocular complications (SOCs) in SJS/TEN. This retrospective cross-sectional study enrolled 47 patients with SJS/TEN who were divided into two groups according to ocular severity at acute onset: non-severe ocular complications group (n = 27) and severe ocular complications group (n = 20). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that disease severity (body surface area detachment ≥ 10%) was a predictive factor for acute SOCs, and older age (≥ 60 years) was marginally significantly predictive of SOCs. Serum biomarker levels of S100A8/A9 and granulysin were marginally significant and tended to increase in the SOC group. Therefore, during the early acute stage, focusing on disease severity, patient age, and serum inflammatory biomarkers (S100A8/A9 and granulysin) might help predict SOC progression in patients with SJS/TEN who need prompt and aggressive ocular management to prevent severe ocular sequelae."

Various effects are investigated namely: solvent types for preparing the composites; mixing with hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) to improve the methanol response and surface adhesion; number of coating layers; and also sensor performances. The GO/dPIn prepared in acetone provides the highest relative current response towards methanol. The GO/dPIn/HPC achieves not only a good adhesion but also an increase in methanol response, especially 0.5 g of GO/dPIn mixed with 0.75 g of HPC. One coating layer, the relative current response reaches the highest value under N2. However, it decreases in ambient air due to the effects of humidity and interfering gases. Besides, the high applied voltage leads to the increase in methanol response but the sensing layer is damaged by heat generation. Finally, the sensor is integrated with a portable sensor platform, connected by NFC to a mobile phone. The sensitivity is 0.0123 ppm−1 in the dynamic range 97–1041 ppm at the applied voltage of 0.8 V under ambient air, whereas the response and recovery times are within 12–50 s depending on methanol concentration."

Timely liver transplant (LT) may improve survival. We evaluated various indices for assessment of the severity of liver failure and their application for eligibility and timing of living donor LT (LDLT). Methods: Altogether 1021 patients were analyzed for the severity and organ failure at admission to determine transplant eligibility and 28 day survival with or without transplant. Results: The ACLF cohort [mean age 44 ± 12.2 years, males 81%) was of sick patients; 55% willing for LT at admission, though 63% of them were ineligible due to sepsis or organ failure. On day 4, recovery in sepsis and/or organ failure led to an improvement in transplant eligibility from 37% at baseline to 63.7%. Delay in LT up to 7 days led to a higher incidence of multiorgan failure (p < 0.01) contributing to 23% of the first week and 55% of all-cause 28-day mortality. In a matched cohort analysis, the actuarial survival with LT (n = 41) and conditional survival in the absence of transplant (n = 191) were comparable, when the condition, i.e., transplant was adjusted. The comparison curve showed differentiation in survival beyond 7 days (p < 0.01). Conclusions: ACLF is a rapidly progressive disease and risk stratification within the first week of hospitalization is needed. ‘Emergent LT’ should be defined in the first week in the ACLF patients; the transplant window for improving survival in a live donor setting.

Since data in case reports and series could potentially be subsets of larger studies, only studies with ≥ 50 patients were included. Random-effects model meta-analysis was used to calculate weighted mean difference (WMD) and pooled odds ratio (OR) of factors associated with mortality. From a total 1,137 articles retrieved, 13 were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis comprising 4,440 KTR. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were significantly older (WMD 10.5 years, 95% CI 9.3–11.8). KTR of deceased donor were at higher risk of death (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.10–2.74). Comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and active cancer significantly increased mortality risk. KTR with dyspnea (OR 5.68, 95% CI 2.11–15.33) and pneumonia (OR 10.64, 95% CI 3.37–33.55) at presentation were at higher mortality risk, while diarrhea decreased the risk (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47–0.78). Acute kidney injury was associated with mortality (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.36–7.70). Inflammatory markers were significantly higher in the non-survivors, including C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukine-6. A number of COVID-19 mortality risk factors were identified from KTR patient characteristics, presenting symptoms, and laboratory investigations. KTR with these risk factors should receive more intensive monitoring and early therapeutic interventions to optimize health outcomes."
['Virology'],"Genetic characterization of chikungunya virus isolates from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected during a recent outbreak in Bangkok, Thailand  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne emerging pathogen that is transmitted to humans through the bite of female Aedes mosquitoes. CHIKV infection has become a major public health concern worldwide, as it has a significant impact on the healthcare system. Since 2004, the virus has emerged in Africa and subsequently spread to countries located near the Indian Ocean, including India, and to Europe, the Americas, and Asia. In Thailand, a large CHIKV outbreak occurred during 2008–2009 and was caused by a virus originating from the east/central/south African (ECSA) CHIKV genotype. Since then, the ECSA genotype of CHIKV has continued to circulate and has caused sporadic cases in different areas in Thailand. Approximately 20,000 reported cases have been confirmed by the Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2020. However, the causes of this CHIKV re-emergence remain unclear. To obtain a better understanding of CHIKV circulation during the recent outbreak in Bangkok, Thailand, complete genome analysis of CHIKV isolates from field-caught mosquitoes collected in outbreak areas was performed. A total of 28 Ae. aegypti samples (21 females and 7 males) were collected, and individual mosquitoes were used for CHIKV detection and isolation. Eleven of 28 (39.29%) female and three of 28 (10.71%) male mosquitoes were positive for CHIKV by E1 nested RT-PCR. Four CHIKV isolates were successfully isolated from four female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Based on complete genome analysis, several amino acid substitutions were identified in the protein coding region. The E1:K211E and E2:V264A mutations in the background of the E1:226A mutation were observed in all four CHIKV isolates. An important observation was the presence of one amino acid substitution, leading to an E1:K245R change. This mutation was found in all four CHIKV isolates from mosquitoes in this study and in Thai patients described previously. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the four CHIKV isolates belonged to the Indian Ocean clade of the ECSA genotype. The results obtained in this study provide detailed information on the molecular characteristics and evolution of currently circulating CHIKV strains in Thailand, which are useful for developing prevention and control strategies."

['Pharmacology'],"Targets and strategies for vaccine development against dengue viruses  2021 The AuthorsDengue virus (DENV) is a global health threat causing about half of the worldwide population to be at risk of infection, especially the people living in tropical and subtropical area. Although the dengue disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) is asymptomatic and self-limiting in most people with first infection, increased severe dengue symptoms may be observed in people with heterotypic secondary DENV infection. Since there is a lack of specific antiviral medication, the development of dengue vaccines is critical in the prevention and control this disease. Several targets and strategies in the development of dengue vaccine have been demonstrated. Currently, Dengvaxia, a live-attenuated chimeric yellow-fever/tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur, has been licensed and approved for clinical use in some countries. However, this vaccine has demonstrated low efficacy in children and dengue-naïve individuals and also increases the risk of severe dengue in young vaccinated recipients. Accordingly, many novel strategies for the dengue vaccine are under investigation and development. Here, we conducted a systemic literature review according to PRISMA guidelines to give a concise overview of various aspects of the vaccine development process against DENVs, mainly targeting five potential strategies including live attenuated vaccine, inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine, viral-vector vaccine, and DNA vaccine. This study offers the comprehensive view of updated information and current progression of immunogen selection as well as strategies of vaccine development against DENVs."

The results were authenticate the nZVI nanoparticles have a chain shape and establish as separable nanospheres with an average size (29.95 nm) on the surface of IK. The FTIR spectra demonstrate the presence of Al-O as well as Si-O bonds. XRD results demonstrate the presence of zerovalent iron. SEM confirmed less agglomeration of Fe(0) nanoparticles which improves the mechanical strength. The weak signals of Fe and O confirm the establishment of zerovalent iron in nanocomposite. TEM demonstrates that the nanocomposite has a chain like structure. Pb(II)percentage removal was improved by rise in the IK-nZVI amount which results in rising the adsorption site. The nanocomposite had on optimum Pb(II) sorption at pH range of 4.5–6.5. The amount adsorbent increasing with the Pb(II) removal percentage was decreased. Kinetics study demonstrated that Pb(II) sorption was accomplished through more than one processes. IK was proved active support to progress the dispersion, and steadiness of IK-nZVI nanocomposite. The sorption processes pollutant was estimated through the kinetics models, and different sorption isotherm equations like Langmuir (LM), Langmuir-Freundlich (L-F), and Freundlich (FL) isotherms. The IK-nZVI typically accompanies outstanding Pb(II) removal efficiency of 98% and 96.05% with a span of 5 and 10 min for low and high concentrations, respectively. Significantly, the results reveal the maximum adsorption capability of the IK-nZVI is 192.0 mg/g. The thermodynamic study shown endothermic and spontaneous adsorption onto the IK-nZVI surface. Specifically, the IK-nZVI nanocomposite possesses key advantages in terms of simple method, nature friendly, cost-effectiveness, and decent adsorption efficiency for the potential elimination of toxic metal ion (Pb(II)) in the aqueous phase."

This study proposes a novel cross-species triplex droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assay to simultaneously identify and quantify the ratios of pork/beef meat fractions from a total DNA content, including processed and autoclaved meat, without requiring a standard, achieving high sensitivity with a limit of quantification estimated at 0.1% (w/w) and a limit of detection down to 0.01% (w/w). A single copy nuclear gene, β-actin, was employed as a target, accompanied with myostatin gene as a cross-species target to quantify the meat background. The duplex assay provided a simultaneous quantification of pork and myostatin, whereas the triplex assay was able to detect pork, beef and myostatin with a decrease of technical error, cost and time."
['Multidisciplinary'],"Impact of children born with low birth weight on stunting and wasting in Sindh province of Pakistan: a propensity score matching approach  2021, The Author(s).Low Birth Weight (LBW) is considered as a major public health issue and leading cause of neonatal death. Almost one in four newborns are reported as underweight in Pakistan. Children born with low birth weight are highly vulnerable to develop diseases and death and/or remain undernourished (i.e., stunted and wasted). This study determines the LBW newborns are more prone to develop stunting and wasting in province of Sindh, Pakistan. Moreover, regression-based estimation of the impact of LBW on the child health outcomes of under five years of age, may be prone to selection bias because of the nature of non-experimental data set, thus, propensity score matching methods are used in this study. Data for this study was used from Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS-2014). MICS is a two-stage, stratified cluster sampling household level data covering urban and rural areas and consists of 19,500 households from five administrative divisions and 28 districts of Sindh province of Pakistan. The total sample size of children less than five years of age after cleaning the data are 7781, of which 2095 are LBW having birth weight categorized as “smaller than average and very small” and 5686 are normal birth weight (NBW) having birth weight very large, larger than average, and average. This study employed propensity score matching (PSM) regression methods to understand whether the children born as low birth weight are more prone to stunting and wasting and/or both. In province of Sindh, moderate wasting children under five years were 21%, severe wasting 6% and both wasting and stunting 10%. The propensity score results are shown significant in all groups. Specifically, all four types of PSM methods confirm a significant difference in the potential outcome variables—meaning that a child born with LBW has a significant adverse effect on the potential child health outcome variables (stunting, wasting and both). Thus, the propensity score matching findings confirm a significant and adverse effect of LBW on potential health outcomes of under five children. Similarly, low birth weight children are significantly more likely to be moderately wasted (OR = 1.5, CI = 1.3–1.6) and severely wasted (OR = 1.6, CI = 1.3–2.0) and both (stunted and wasted, OR = 2.0, CI = 1.7–2.3) as compared to children with normal birth weight. Male children, if born with low birth weight, are significantly more likely to be moderately wasted (OR = 1.3, CI = 1.1–1.5) and both (wasted and stunted, OR = 1.3, CI = 1.1–1.5) than girls. This large data analysis finding proved that the LBW newborns are on higher risk to develop wasting and stunting in Pakistan."

The RETAC jig could be used to separate plastics heavier than water (specific gravity (SG) > 1.0) with different SGs while the hybrid jig—a process combining jig and flotation—was developed to separate plastics with similar SGs but different surface wettabilities. Meanwhile the reverse jig—a RETAC jig with a top screen—is used to separate plastics lighter than water with different SGs. In this study, a novel method that combines the principle of reverse and hybrid jigs, called “reverse hybrid jig separation” was developed to separate plastics lighter than water having similar SGs but different surface wettabilities. The tests were carried out with wastes from an eco-cable wire recycling facility in Japan, which is composed of polyethylene (PE) and cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE). The reverse hybrid jig separation results showed that bubble attachment to and detachment from plastic particles strongly influenced the separation efficiency. In addition, the effects of particle size on separation efficiency were also evaluated."
"['Computer Science (all)', 'Engineering (all)']","A multi-objective modeling approach to harvesting resource scheduling: Decision support for a more sustainable Thai sugar industry  2021 The Author(s)This paper develops a multi-objective modeling approach for the scheduling of harvesting resources in the Thai sugar industry, in which different objectives stemming from different industry stakeholders are concurrently optimized with the overall goal to create a more sustainable sugar supply chain. In addition to traditional economic objectives, the environmental impact of sugarcane farm burning is included into the model to better reflect the current harvesting practice, where sugarcane growers often resort to burning their fields due to the lack of available harvesting resources during the season. An evolutionary algorithm based on a variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is also devised to help solve the resulting Multi-Objective Harvesting Resource Scheduling Problem (MOHRSP), which normally becomes intractable for real-life problem instances. We find that the proposed PSO framework is notably efficient as it provides diverse sets of non-dominated solutions with markedly low coefficients of variation in a reasonable amount of time. We also find that, by sacrificing a slight amount of sugar production volume, the whole sugar supply chain could be largely improved, especially for the sugarcane growers, whose profitability turns out to be sensitive in the trade-offs with other objectives."

The results reveal that our low-cost and rapid AgNPs-CUR sensor is highly selective for Pb2+ ions with the detection limit of 13.6 µM (2.8 mg.L−1) and can be applied for real water samples. Not only the observed absorption spectrum and the solution color can reveal the contamination of Pb2+ in the sample, but also an orange floccules precipitate can be clearly observed by naked-eye within 20 min. In addition, the results obtained from DFT calculation agree well with the experiments. Density functional theory (DFT), at the M06 level with mixed basis set of 6-31G(d) and def2-tzvp, was applied to propose the binding mechanism of AgNPs with CUR and AgNPs-CUR with Pb2+. Calculated binding energies of the compound of AgNPs with CUR and the AgNPs-CUR with Pb2+ are −145.8 and −361.4 kcal mol−1, respectively, indicating that the AgNPs-CUR is strongly interact with Pb2+ ions through formation of highly stable Pb2+AgNPs-CUR complexes indicating the stable aggregative phenomena which agrees well with FTIR spectrum."

BA at concentrations of 10, 15, and 20 mg was incorporated into the HMB matrix. Physical and chemical properties, including NH3 sensitivity, of the fabricated indicators were analyzed. Results indicate that incorporation of 10 and 15 mg of BA improved the microstructure, tensile strength, transparency, and thermal stability of HMB. However, the HMB indicator with 15 mg of BA (1.5BA-HMB) exhibited better NH3 sensitivity than that of the HMB indicator with 10 mg of BA. Therefore, 15 mg was selected as the optimum concentration of BA for indicator fabrication. The 1.5BA-HMB indicator was used to monitor the freshness of mackerel (Scomber scombrus) by attaching it to inside of the package exposed to the headspace. The 1.5BA-HMB indicator clearly changed color with respect to variation in the quality of S. scombrus during storage at 4 °C. Based on the changes in the color of 1.5BA-HMB, the quality of S. scombrus was interpreted as follows: deep purple and light purple colors indicated that S. scombrus was fresh, violet color indicated that S. scombrus was suitable for eating, and blue, green ocean, and colonial blue colors indicated spoilage of S. scombrus. Thus, the 1.5BA-HMB indicator can be used as a sustainable pH-responsive indicator for intelligent food packaging."
"['Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine', 'Internal Medicine']","Factors associated with medication adherence of hypertensive patients in the Philippines: a systematic review  2021, The Author(s).Background: Diseases of the heart and vascular system are the leading cause of mortality in the Philippines. Hypertension, the most important modifiable risk factor, has a prevalence rate of 28% and a control rate of 20%. Despite the proven efficacy of pharmacologic treatment, medication adherence is reported to be as low as 66%. While there are publications that reported factors that affect adherence in Filipinos, there are no existing research that evaluated them systematically. This review is conducted to present and synthesize findings of published literatures. Methods: Databases—PubMed, Scopus, Wiley Online library, Science Direct, JSTOR, Web of Science, SAGE journals, and Cochrane—were used to search for articles published from 2000 to 2020 that studied medication adherence in adult Filipino hypertensive population. Out of the initial 1514 articles, 15 articles met the criteria and were included in the analysis. The evidence from the included studies was summarized and discussed in a narrative review using the World Health Organization framework for adherence to long-term therapies as the framework. Result: The factors that were positively associated with adherence were health care system-related factors: good patient-health provider relationship, accessibility of health services, use of specialty clinics and programs for hypertension, and health insurance. The factors found to be negatively associated with adherence are (1) social economic factors: younger age, single civil status, low educational attainment, and unemployment; (2) patient-related factors: low in health literacy and awareness, knowledge on hypertension, attitude towards hypertension, self-efficacy, and social support; (3) therapy-related factors: inconsistent drug regimen schedule, use of Thiazide and complementary and alternative medicines; (4) condition-related factors: low illness perception, and absence of comorbidities. Conclusions: Findings should be interpreted with caution because of methodological limitations. Despite this, given that health systems related factors are modifiable, they can be the focus of interventions and future researches to increase medication adherence. Clinicians may also want to screen their Filipino hypertensive patients for factors that are associated to low adherence in order to provide a tailored advice. Longitudinal research studies with heterogeneous samples of hypertensive Filipinos are imperative so that targeted interventions can be developed for the population."

Journal of Viral Hepatitis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates bile acid homeostasis and is a drug target for metabolic liver diseases. FXR also plays an important role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA transcription. In vitro and in mice, FXR agonist treatment leads to inhibition of viral replication and a decline in viral proteins, pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and HBV DNA levels. We aimed to translate this to a clinical use by primarily evaluating the safety and secondary the anti-viral effect of Vonafexor, a FXR agonist, in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. In total, 73 CHB patients were enrolled in a two-part Phase Ib double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive oral Vonafexor (100, 200 and 400 mg once daily, or 200 mg twice daily), placebo, or entecavir (Part A, n = 48) or to receive Vonafexor (300 mg once daily or 150 mg twice daily), or placebo, combined with pegylated-interferon-α2a (Part B, n = 25) for 29 days. Patients were followed up for 35 days. Enrolled CHB patients were mostly HBeAg-negative. Vonafexor was overall well tolerated and safe. The most frequent adverse events were moderate gastrointestinal events. Pruritus was more frequent with twice-daily compared with once-daily regimens (56%–67% vs. 16%, respectively, p < 0.05). Vonafexor monotherapy of 400 mg once daily decreased HBsAg concentrations (–0.1 log10 IU/mL, p < 0.05), and Vonafexor/pegylated-IFN-α2a combination therapy decreased HBcrAg and pgRNA. In conclusion, Vonafexor was safe with a decline in HBV markers observed in CHB patients suggesting a potential anti-viral effect the therapeutic potential of which has to be evaluated in larger trials."

We performed an updated meta-analysis of RCTs, to include recent data from cryoballoon-based ablation and to compare arrhythmia-free survival and adverse events between ablation and AADs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to December 2020. We included RCT comparing patients with pAF undergoing ablation or receiving AADs as an initial therapy. We combined data using the random-effects model to calculate hazards ratio (HR) for arrhythmia-free survival and odds ratio (OR) for adverse events. Results: Five studies from 2005 to 2020 involving 985 patients were included (495 patients and 490 patients underwent ablation and medication as initial therapy, respectively). Patients who underwent ablation had higher freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) during the 12-24 months follow-up period (pooled HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.40-0.59, P <.001). In a subgroup analysis of ablation method used, both cryoablation group (pooled HR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.38-0.64, P <.001) and radiofrequency ablation group (pooled HR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.35-0.64, P <.001) showed reduction in AT recurrence compared with AAD group. There were no differences in adverse events including cerebrovascular accident, pericardial effusion or tamponade, pulmonary vein stenosis, acute coronary syndrome, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and bradycardia requiring a pacemaker. Conclusion: Catheter ablation (both cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation) is superior to AAD as an initial therapy for pAF in efficacy for reducing AT recurrences without a compromise in adverse events."

Secondary ATC is diagnosed if the patient had a history of DTC or co-existing DTC components at time of diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, clinical presentations, outcomes, and genetic backgrounds of primary versus secondary ATCs. We searched for ATCs in our institutional databases and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the genetic alterations of primary and secondary ATCs. From our multi-institutional database, 22 primary and 23 secondary ATCs were retrieved. We also identified 620 and 24 primary and secondary ATCs in the SEER database, respectively. Compared to primary ATCs, secondary ATCs were not statistically different in terms of demographic, clinical manifestations, and patient survival. The only clinical discrepancy between the two groups was a significantly larger tumor diameter of the primary ATCs. The prevalence of TERT promoter, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutations was comparable between the two subtypes. In comparison to primary ATCs, however, BRAF mutations were more prevalent (OR = 4.70; 95% CI = 2.84–7.78) whereas RAS mutations were less frequent (OR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.21–0.85) in secondary tumors.

However, the mechanisms driving this phenomenon are still unknown. Here, we have identified novel therapeutic targets for and mediators of lupus-mediated bone loss using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in a FcγRIIB-/- mouse model of lupus associated osteopenia. A total of 2,710 upregulated and 3,252 downregulated DEGs were identified. The GO and KEGG annotations revealed that osteoclast differentiation, bone mineralization, ossification, and myeloid cell development were downregulated. WikiPathways indicated that Hedgehog, TNFα NF-κB and Notch signaling pathway were also decreased. We identified downregulated targets, Sufu and Serpina12, that have important roles in bone homeostasis. Sufu and Serpina12 were related to Hedgehog signaling proteins, including Gli1, Gli2, Gli3, Ptch1, and Ptch2. Gene knockdown analysis demonstrated that Sufu, and Serpina12 contributed to osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, respectively. Osteoclast and osteoblast marker genes were significantly decreased in Sufu-deficient and Serpina12-deficient cells, respectively. Our results suggest that alterations in Hedgehog signaling play an important role in the pathogenesis of osteopenia in FcγRIIB-/- mice. The novel DEGs and pathways identified in this study provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of mandibular bone loss during lupus development."

This study aimed to evaluate the acceptance and outcomes of ASP de-escalation recommendations in children who received meropenem. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in children aged 1 month to 18 years who received meropenem in a tertiary-care teaching hospital. The ASP team gave recommendation between 72 and 120 h after initiating meropenem therapy. Acceptance of de-escalation recommendations among primary physicians was evaluated within 24 h of recommendation. Outcomes included clinical success rate on the 7th day and incidence rate of acquisition of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) within 30 days. Results: From March to December 2019, 217 children with a median (interquartile range) age of 2.1 (0.6, 9.5) years received meropenem. The ASP team gave recommendations in 127 (58.5%) of cases for continuation of meropenem therapy and 90 (41.5%) of cases for de-escalation. The overall acceptance of ASP de-escalation recommendations was 57.8% (95%CI: 46.9–68.1%). Clinical success rates were 85.2% in the accepted group compared to 77.5% in the rejected group (P = 0.06). The incidence rate of acquisition of CR-GNB within 30 days after treatment was 5.8% in the accepted group and 15.8% in the rejected group (P = 0.03). Conclusions: About half of the recommendations to de-escalate meropenem prescriptions were accepted through the ASP intervention. Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria acquisitions was less likely in the de-escalation group. A robust de-escalation strategy 72 h following carbapenem initiation should be encouraged to combat multidrug-resistant organisms."
"['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","Assessment and analysis of multi-biomass fuels for sustainable electricity generation  2021 Elsevier LtdMany biomass power plants are not flexible, using only one fuel type, and have high CO2 emissions. In this study, a new methodology to assess the multi-biomass utilization for a power plant is proposed. The results provide that the proportions of mixed biomass residues in different regions of Thailand are appropriate with lower chloride content and slagging inclination than the standard specification. However, high alkali metal oxides in biomass in the southern region lead to high fouling inclination with high fly ash deposition. The electricity production using multi-biomass fuel is more efficient with lower fuel consumption than that with single-type biomass. To generate 103.43 MW electricity production, 107.89 t h−1 consumption of mixed biomass fuels in the central is lower than that with multi-biomass in other regions. However, it generates a maximum of 12.5 mol% CO2 in exhaust gases which can be captured by suitable amine-based absorbents with 90.82% efficiency."
['Medicine (all)'],"Unilateral Urrets-Zavalia syndrome after Implantable Collamer Lens implantation: a case report and review of the literature  2021, The Author(s).Background: Fixed dilated pupil after ophthalmic surgery or Urrets-Zavalia syndrome occurs after anterior segment surgery and usually relates to postoperative elevation of intraocular pressure. Urrets-Zavalia syndrome results in complaints of glare, halo, and photophobia. Retention of the viscoelastic agent during Implantable Collamer Lens implantation can result in postoperative elevation of intraocular pressure and Urrets-Zavalia syndrome. However, reversibility of pupillary dilatation is possible in some cases. Case presentation: A 20-year-old Thai man with myopic astigmatism in both eyes underwent Implantable Collamer Lens implantation in the right eye. The preoperative slit-lamp examination of both eyes was normal, and no ectatic changes were detected from corneal tomography. One hour after the uncomplicated surgery of the right eye, intraocular pressure increased to 48 mmHg and was immediately controlled with antiglaucoma medications. Postoperative pupillary dilatation was detected, presumably due to effect of preoperative application of mydriatic drops. At postoperative day 1, the right pupil remained dilated but still reactive to light and pilocarpine 2% eye drops. Two weeks later, the left eye underwent the Implantable Collamer Lens implantation and showed neither postoperative increase in intraocular pressure nor postoperative pupillary dilatation. Two months after surgery, the dilatation of the right pupil partially reversed. Conclusions: The findings of the right eye suggested diagnosis of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome. Compared with former reports, we noted an association between immediate control of elevation of postoperative intraocular pressure, light reactivity of the dilated pupil, and reactivity to pilocarpine 2% eye drops as potential predictors for reversibility of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome."

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdTo maximize the potential of genomics in medicine, it is essential to establish databases of genomic variants for ethno-geographic groups that can be used for filtering and prioritizing candidate pathogenic variants. Populations with non-European ancestry are poorly represented among current genomic variant databases. Here, we report the first high-density survey of genomic variants for the Thai population, the Thai Reference Exome (T-REx) variant database. T-REx comprises exome sequencing data of 1092 unrelated Thai individuals. The targeted exome regions common among four capture platforms cover 30.04 Mbp on autosomes and chromosome X. 345 681 short variants (18.27% of which are novel) and 34 907 copy number variations were found. Principal component analysis on 38 469 single nucleotide variants present worldwide showed that the Thai population is most genetically similar to East and Southeast Asian populations. Moreover, unsupervised clustering revealed six Thai subpopulations consistent with the evidence of gene flow from neighboring populations. The prevalence of common pathogenic variants in T-REx was investigated in detail, which revealed subpopulation-specific patterns, in particular variants associated with erythrocyte disorders such as the HbE variant in HBB and the Viangchan variant in G6PD. T-REx serves as a pivotal addition to the current databases for genomic medicine."
"['Health (social science)', 'Geriatrics and Gerontology']","Smoking and Drinking Behaviors among Older Adults: A Comparative Analysis of Three Southeast Asian Countries  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Studies on the two major health-risk behaviors of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol among older populations, particularly in Southeast Asia, are limited. This paper provides comparative analyses of the prevalences and correlates of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol among older people in Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand, using data from the latest available national aging surveys in the three countries. The analyses were conducted within a multivariate framework. Gender-specific results show that smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol are more common among older men than women in all three countries. However, the prevalence of smoking and drinking among men declines at older ages. The multivariate analyses reveal that a higher level of education has a significant negative association with smoking and drinking in all three settings, but the magnitude and the direction of associations vary considerably between countries and genders. Area of residence is correlated with smoking among men in all three countries, whereas co-residential arrangements with spouse, children, or both significantly reduce alcohol consumption among men in Myanmar and among men and women in Thailand. In all three settings a significant complementary relationship between smoking and drinking is observed. From a policy perspective this implies that a successful reduction in smoking could be achieved through anti-drinking campaigns and vice versa."
['Dentistry (all)'],"Prevalence of complex root canal morphology in the mandibular first and second premolars in Thai population: CBCT analysis  2021, The Author(s).Background: Mandibular premolars demonstrate high variability in root canal morphology, especially mandibular first premolars. The purposes of this study were to determine the prevalence of root canal configurations of mandibular premolars according to Vertucci classification in a Thai population. Methods: Total of 1159 CBCT images of Thai patients who received radiographic imaging at the Department of Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University in 2017–2018 was evaluated. The data were reported using descriptive statistics and the relationship between the prevalence of the root canal complexities and sex was analyzed using the chi-squared test. Results: The most common root canal configuration was Vertucci type I, with a 63.1% and 98% prevalence in the mandibular first and second premolars, respectively. More than 98% of mandibular premolars had a single root. The prevalence of a bifurcation was 28.5% and 1.5% in the mandibular first and second premolars, respectively. The prevalence of a trifurcation was 3.2% in the mandibular first premolar. A C-shaped root canal was observed at 23.7% and 0.7% in the mandibular first and second premolars, respectively. The level of branching was mostly found at the middle 1/3 of the root. Bilateral appearance of the same root canal configuration was identified in 80.3% and 95.9% in the mandibular first and second premolars, respectively. There was no relationship between sex and the prevalence of a bifurcation, trifurcation, or C-shaped root canal. Conclusion: Mandibular first premolars have more root canal complexities than mandibular second premolars. Horizontal tube shift x-ray technique, CBCT, dental operating microscope, and knowledge of root canal configurations have an important role in root canal identification in mandibular premolar with suspected complex root canal morphology."

Anaerobic treatment is an effective process with double advantages of waste stabilization and energy production. However, high organic compound and sodium toxicity in high-salinity wastewaters adversely affect the performance of anaerobic treatment. In this study, anaerobic hybrid (AH) and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors were investigated for their efficiencies to alleviate the negative effects of high-salinity wastewater. RESULTS: Double increases in the NaCl concentration drastically deteriorated the performances of both reactors. The activities of acetoclastic methanogens (ACM) and hydrogenotrophic methanogens (HTM) in both reactors decreased to 22–28% and 36–40% compared to the previous period, respectively. However, the methanogen population (Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales) was not affected negatively. The AH reactor exhibited excellent performance during the recovery and restart periods, which only required 7 days to complete the recovery period. Furthermore, during the restart period, the AH reactor showed high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, methane (CH4) production and yield as ≈90%, 2600 mL day−1 and 0.30 m3 CH4 kg−1 CODremoved, respectively. The rate of biomass washout from the AH reactor also was lower compared to the UASB reactor. The concentration of attached biomass in the packed zone of the AH reactor gradually increased indicating the growth of an active microbial biofilm. CONCLUSION: The excellent performance of the AH reactor was presumably a result of its packed zone configuration which provided the supporting media to entrap smaller microbial aggregates, reduce biomass washout and support the growth of active biofilm.  2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)."

MPs can be consumed and may be accumulated by filter-feeding organisms such as mussels. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the acute effects of different types, sizes and concentrations of artificially synthesized MPs on the mortality rate and MP accumulation of the green mussel Perna viridis. The samples were exposed to 66, 333, 666, and 1333 items/L of small MPs (<30 μm), medium MPs (30–300 μm), and large MPs (300–1000 μm) polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polybutylene succinate (PBS) for 96 h. MPs accumulation in the soft tissue of mussels and mortality effects from MPs ingestion were assessed. There was no mortality observed in the control group. Small PP particles can lead to more mortality than PS and PBS particles of the same size. However, medium- and large PS caused a higher mortality percentage than the same size particles of PP and PBS. Large PS, PP, and PBS showed higher mortality potential than other sizes. MPs largely accumulated in the soft tissues rather than in gill tissues following the 96-hour exposure period. Increased accumulation of the three types of MPs was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of mussel mortality. The study highlights how particle size and type are key factors in plastic particulate toxicity."

Distinct clusters of microbiomes and AMR determinants were observed at D.8 when Prevotella (20.9%) was the major genus, whereas at D. − 3–D.3, Alistipes (6.9–12.7%) and Bacteroides (5.2–8.5%) were the major genera. Lactobacillus and Escherichia were notably observed at D. − 3 (1.2%) and D. − 3–D.3 (0.2–0.4%), respectively. For AMR, a distinct cluster of AMR determinants was observed at D.8, mainly conferring resistance to macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin (mefA), β-lactam (cfxA6 and aci1) and phenicol (rlmN). In contrast, at D. − 3–D.3, a high abundance of determinants with aminoglycoside (AMG) (sat, aac(6')-aph(2''), aadA and acrF), β-lactam (fus-1, cepA and mrdA), multidrug resistance (MDR) (gadW, mdtE, emrA, evgS, tolC and mdtB), phenicol (catB4 and cmlA4), and sulfonamide patterns (sul3) was observed. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) plot associated Escherichia coli with aac(6')-aph(2''), emrA, mdtB, catB4 and cmlA4 at D. − 3, D.0 and/or D.3 whereas at D.8 associations between Prevotella and mefA, cfxA6 and aci1 were identified.

We hypothesized that the SSNB would manage pain better on ambulation 24 hours postoperatively compared to periarticular infiltration (PAI), when combined with postoperative continuous ACB. Methods: Seventy-two patients undergoing elective TKA under spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to either SSNB (SSNB group) or intraoperative PAI (PAI group). All patients received postoperative multimodal analgesia, including continuous ACB. The primary outcome was pain on ambulation 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included rest and dynamic numerical rating scale pain score, intravenous morphine requirement, functional performance measures, adverse events, satisfaction, and length of stay. Results: There was no difference in pain score during movement between the groups (mean difference −0.48 [−1.38 to 0.42], p = 0.3) and other immediate overall pain scores 24 hours postoperatively. Patients in the SSNB group had significantly lower intravenous morphine requirement than the PAI group for 48 hours postoperatively (0 [0, 0] vs. 0 [0, 2]; p = 0.008). There was no intergroup difference in the performance-based measures, satisfaction, and length of stay. Conclusions: The SSNB did not provide superior postoperative analgesia, or improvement in immediate functional performance. However, it may result in lower opioid consumption postoperatively when compared with the intraoperative PAI."

This retrospective study was conducted on 135 Thai hemodialysis (HD) patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). CASR A990G genotypes were determined. The patients were identified as either G carriers (heterozygous or homozygous CASR 990G allele carriers) or noncarriers (homozygous CASR 990A carriers). Tested covariates were baseline PTH level (bPTH), baseline serum phosphate (bPhos), baseline serum calcium (bCa), baseline calcitriol equivalent dose (bCtriol), baseline ergocalciferol dose (bErgo), and age. The ANCOVA showed that intact PTH levels after 12 weeks of cinacalcet treatment (PTHw12) was significantly lower among G carriers compared with noncarriers after controlling for bPTH, bPhos, bCtriol, and bErgo (F(1, 127) = 15.472, p < 0.001), with the adjusted mean difference of 253.7 pg/mL. The logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of a G carrier achieving 30% PTH reduction after 12-week cinacalcet treatment were 3.968 times greater than the odds for a noncarrier after adjusting for bPhos, bCtriol, and age. In conclusion, the CASR A990G polymorphism significantly influences cinacalcet response in HD patients with SHPT."

Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: To investigate whether TGF-β/BMP signalling participates in Jagged1-induced osteogenic differentiation in human dental pulp cells (hDPs). Methodology: Bioinformatic analysis of publicly available RNA sequencing data of Jagged1-treated hDPs was performed using NetworkAnalyst. The mRNA expression was validated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. hDPs were seeded on Jagged1 immobilized surfaces in the presence or absence of TGF-β or BMP inhibitor. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated using alkaline phosphatase staining, osteogenic marker gene expression and mineralization assay. Statistical analyses were performed using a Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by a pairwise comparison for more than three group comparison. Mann–Whitney U-test was employed for two group comparison. The statistical significance was considered at p <.05. Results: Jagged1 treatment in growth medium significantly promoted TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 whilst significantly inhibited BMP2, BMP4 and BMP6 mRNA expression (p <.05). In osteogenic induction medium, Jagged1 significantly up-regulated TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 at days 1 and 3 (p <.05). Pre-treatment with TGF-β1, TGF-β2 or TGF-β3 prior to osteogenic induction resulted in the significant increase of osteogenic marker gene expression, collagen type 1 protein expression, alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity and mineral deposition (p <.05). However, TGF-β signalling inhibition with SB431542 (4 μmol L−1) or SB505124 (47 and 129 nmol L−1) failed to attenuate the effect of Jagged1-induced osteogenic differentiation in hDPs. Dorsomorphin (4 and 8 μmol L−1) treatment significantly abolished the effect of Jagged1 on mineralization by hDPs (p <.05). Conclusion: Notch signalling activation by Jagged1 modulated TGF-β and BMP ligand expression. Dorsomorphin, but not TGF-β receptor inhibitor, attenuated Jagged1-induced osteogenic differentiation in hDPs."

Anti-inflammatory activities of ECa 233 have been reported; however the immunomodulatory effects of ECa 233 on regulatory T cells, which have a pivotal role in immune regulation, has not been elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ECa 233 on regulatory T cells that may provide benefits in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Methods: ECa 233 was prepared as oral suspension in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose and administered to male Wistar rats via oral gavage. The pharmacokinetics and toxicity of ECa 233 were evaluated. Splenic lymphocytes were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry and qPCR to determine the immunomodulatory effects of ECa 233 on regulatory T cells. Results: All rats had good tolerability to ECa 233 and other test preparations. The pharmacokinetic study showed low oral bioavailability for both triterpenoids, with the maximum plasma concentration reached at 4 h for asiaticoside and at 0.5 h for madecassoside. Multiple oral administration of ECa 233 reduced the frequency of T cells, particularly CD8 T cells in rats. ECa 233 enhanced the percentage of regulatory T cells, characterized by high expression of CD25+ and upregulation of FoxP3 gene. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that ECa 233 possesses immunosuppressive properties by enhancing regulatory T cells. These results provide in vivo evidence for the anti-inflammatory action of ECa 233, in line with previously reports, and the potential uses of ECa 233 in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases."

However, the applicability of the FE method for simulating the structural responses of degraded RC beams repaired with steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) remains unclear. In this study, RC beams subjected to corrosion and repaired with SFRC were carefully studied, based on experimental investigations and FE modeling. Eight RC beams were initially subjected to a corrosion process before being repaired by SFRC in the flexural zone (tension region). The repaired beams were then subjected to four-point bending tests and numerical simulations to investigate their structural performances. The behaviors of the shear carrying capacity, load–deflection relationship, reinforcement strain, cracking and deformation mechanisms, and steel–SFRC/steel–concrete bond profiles were experimentally investigated and validated the predictive performances in the simulations. The results from the analyses demonstrated that the beams subjected to a high corrosion degree and repaired by SFRC with 2% of steel fiber volume resisted the largest crack openings. The failure of the SFRC-repaired beams tended to convert a brittle shear failure to a ductile failure through the yielding of the tensile reinforcement. An increase in the degree of corrosion reduced the bond efficiency between the corroded steel and SFRC. Furthermore, the effects of the SFRC stress–strain models on the performances of the SFRC-repaired members were investigated based on a parametric study. It was found that the efficiency of the FE simulation depends substantially on the characteristics of the material constitutive models and shear crack transfer coefficients. Finally, effective SFRC stress–strain models were suggested for simulating the responses of SFRC-repaired beams in ANSYS software."

In addition, quantum chemical-based conductor-like screening model for realistic solvents (COSMO-RS) software was used to predict the molecular interaction between low transition temperature mixtures (LTTMs) and pyrethroids based on their σ-profile, σ-potentials, and activity coefficient at infinite dilution. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed for the further separation of the pyrethroids and their quantification. Several key parameters that affect pyrethroid extraction efficiency are identified as the vortex time, type of LTTM, volume of LTTM, type of dispersive solvent, dispersive solvent volume, type of salt, and amount of salt. The extraction time of 90 s and 150 µL of menthol: sesamol at ratio 1:1 were selected as the best conditions, while ionic strength and type of dispersant solvent were not relevant for the extraction of the target compounds. After optimization, the menthol-LTTM-VADLLME method was found to be able to detect pyrethroids in the range of 0.5–1000.0 μg/L with good linearity (correlation coefficient = 0.9988–0.9995). The method detection limit and quantification limit were found to be in the range of 0.05–0.11 μg/L and 0.18–0.35 μg/L, respectively. The relative standard deviation of inter-day and intra-day precisions were 2.2–5.0% (n = 5) and 1.2–1.9% (n = 7) respectively. The optimized method can successively determine pyrethroids in tap, drinking and river water samples with good recoveries of 73–111%.

Journal of Fish Diseases published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Tilapia tilapinevirus (also known as tilapia lake virus, TiLV) is considered to be a new threat to the global tilapia industry. The objective of this study was to develop simple cell culture-based heat-killed (HKV) and formalin-killed (FKV) vaccines for the prevention of disease caused by TiLV. The fish were immunized with 100 µl of either HKV or FKV by intraperitoneal injection with each vaccine containing 1.8 × 106 TCID50-inactivated virus. A booster vaccination was carried out at 21-day post-vaccination (dpv) using the same protocol. The fish were then challenged with a lethal dose of TiLV at 28 dpv. The expression of five immune genes (IgM, IgD, IgT, CD4 and CD8) in the head kidney and spleen of experimental fish was assessed at 14 and 21 dpv and again after the booster vaccination at 28 dpv. TiLV-specific IgM responses were measured by ELISA at the same time points. The results showed that both vaccines conferred significant protection, with relative percentage survival of 71.3% and 79.6% for HKV and FKV, respectively. Significant up-regulation of IgM and IgT was observed in the head kidney of fish vaccinated with HKV at 21 dpv, while IgM, IgD and CD4 expression increased in the head kidney of fish receiving FKV at the same time point. After booster vaccination, IgT and CD8 transcripts were significantly increased in the spleen of fish vaccinated with the HKV, but not with FKV. Both vaccines induced a specific IgM response in both serum and mucus. In summary, this study showed that both HKV and FKV are promising injectable vaccines for the prevention of disease caused by TiLV in Nile tilapia."

Sequencing of the near complete 18S rRNA gene of Acanthamoeba of all isolates has shown that the most predominant genotype T4 found in 87 isolates (66.4%) contained 4 subtypes, i.e. T4A, T4B, T4C and T4F, while all isolates assigned to genotype T2/6 belonged to subtype B. Among intron-bearing genotypes, most isolates harbouring genotype T3 contained S516 introns, characterised by 3 distinct variants whilst all genotypes T4A and T5 were intronless. Identical 18S rRNA sequences of Acanthamoeba were identified across regions of the country and four isolates in this study shared the same sequences with those from remote nations, suggesting that some strains have reproductive success in diverse ecological niche. Nucleotide diversity of genotypes T2/6B, T3, T4, T9 and T11 in this study was significantly less than that among global isolates outside Thailand, implying that limited sequence diversity occurred within local populations. A remarkably higher level of nucleotide diversity in genotype T11 than those of other genotypes (0.041 vs. 0.012–0.024) could be due to cryptic subtypes. Recombination breakpoints have been detected within genotypes and subtypes as well as within isolates despite no evidence for sexual and parasexual cycles in the genus Acanthamoeba. Tajima’s D, Fu & Li’s D* and F* statistics revealed significantly negative deviation from neutrality across genotypes and subtypes, implying purifying selection in this locus. The 18S rRNA gene of the novel genotype ‘T23’ displayed 7.82% to 28.44% sequence differences in comparison with all known genotypes. Both Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees have placed genotype T23 as sister to the clade comprising genotypes T10, T12 and T14, all of these possess cyst structure belonging to morphological group III. Hence, Acanthamoeba bangkokensis sp. nov. is proposed for this novel genotype. It is likely that more genotypes of Acanthamoeba remain to be discovered while the evolution of the 18S rRNA gene of this pathogenic-free living amoeba seems to be ongoing."

Therefore, post-discharge care by a multidisciplinary care team (MDCT) may improve these outcomes. This study aimed to demonstrate the outcomes of implementing comprehensive care by a MDCT in severe AKI survivors. Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted between August 2018 to January 2021. Patients who survived severe AKI stage 2–3 were enrolled and randomized to be followed up with either comprehensive or standard care for 12 months. The comprehensive post-AKI care involved an MDCT (nephrologists, nurses, nutritionists, and pharmacists). The primary outcome was the feasibility outcomes; comprising of the rates of loss to follow up, 3-d dietary record, drug reconciliation, and drug alert rates at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the amount of albuminuria at 12 months. Results: Ninety-eight AKI stage 3 survivors were enrolled and randomized into comprehensive care and standard care groups (49 patients in each group). Compared to the standard care group, the comprehensive care group had significantly better feasibility outcomes; 3-d dietary record, drug reconciliation, and drug alerts (p < 0.001). The mean eGFR at 12 months were comparable between the two groups (66.74 vs. 61.12 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.54). The urine albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR) was significantly lower in the comprehensive care group (36.83 vs. 177.70 mg/g, p = 0.036), while the blood pressure control was also better in the comprehensive care group (87.9% vs. 57.5%, p = 0.006). There were no differences in the other renal outcomes between the two groups. Conclusions: Comprehensive care by an MDCT is feasible and could be implemented for severe AKI survivors. MDCT involvement also yields better reduction of the UACR and better blood pressure control. Trial registration Clinicaltrial.gov: NCT04012008 (First registered July 9, 2019)."
['Materials Science (miscellaneous)'],"Experimental study of the load-deformation behaviour of the precast post-tensioned continuous girder for straddle monorail: Full-scale load test under service and ultimate loading conditions  2021 The Author(s)This study presented the results of an experimental program conducted on a newly proposed Full-scale Precast Post-tensioned Continuous (FPPC) girder for straddle monorail. The investigated FPPC girder represents the actual size, design and construction details for a newly designed monorail transit system (Yellow Line and Pink Line Monorail) in Bangkok, Thailand. The salient features of the newly proposed girder system include lightweight, low-cost, easy and fast construction. The newly proposed FPPC girder is mainly comprised of three reinforced concrete (RC) hollow haunched girders, four piers or supports, two pier segments, four wet joints, and four bearings at each support. The FPPC girder was constructed at the casting yard of Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction Public Company Limited (STECON), Thailand. The FPPC girder was tested under different loading conditions (such as service and ultimate loading conditions). Both service and ultimate loads were applied as two-point loadings. Service load in a monotonic manner was applied on the right exterior span (two-point), middle span (two-point), and on the left exterior span and middle span (four-point). Meanwhile, the ultimate load in a monotonic manner was applied only on the left exterior and middle span as a four-point loading scheme. The test results indicate that the behaviour of the FPPC girder under service load conditions is elastic. Further, cracking of the concrete was not observed at any location. The observed maximum deflections under service load conditions were less than the permissible limits at all locations. Further, the maximum ultimate load-carrying capacity was observed to be much greater than the design load under ultimate loading conditions. This is an indication that the design details and construction procedure of FPPC girder are appropriate and further that this system could be used effectively to construct straddle monorail transit systems. Finite element analysis of FPPC monorail bridge girder was also performed by using a computer program ATENA which is a computational tool for nonlinear engineering analysis of bridges and culverts. The finite element analysis results indicate that the computer program ATENA is well capable to predict the ultimate load carrying capacity, displacement and cracking patterns of FPPC girder."
"['Physiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology (medical)']","Melatonin and its derivative disrupt cancer stem-like phenotypes of lung cancer cells via AKT downregulation  2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdCancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subpopulation of tumour cells, have properties of self-renewal and multipotency, which drive cancer progression and resistance to current treatments. Compounds potentially targeting CSCs have been recently developed. This study shows how melatonin, an endogenous hormone synthesised by the pineal gland, and its derivative suppress CSC-like phenotypes of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, H460, H23, and A549. The effects of MLT and its derivative, acetyl melatonin (ACT), on CSC-like phenotypes were investigated using assays for anchorage-independent growth, three-dimensional spheroid formation, scratch wound healing ability, and CSC marker and upstream protein signalling expression. Enriched CSC spheroids were used to confirm the effect of both compounds on lung cancer cells. MLT and ACT inhibited CSC-like behaviours by suppression of colony and spheroid formation in NSCLC cell lines. Their effects on spheroid formation were confirmed in CSC-enriched H460 cells. CSC markers, CD133 and ALDH1A1, were depleted by both compounds. The behaviour and factors associated to epithelial–mesenchymal transition, as indicated by cell migration and the protein vimentin, were also decreased by MLT and ACT. Mechanistically, MLT and ACT decreased the expression of stemness proteins Oct-4, Nanog, and β-catenin by reducing active AKT (phosphorylated AKT). Suppression of the AKT pathway was not mediated through melatonin receptors. This study demonstrates a novel role, and its underlying mechanism, for MLT and its derivative ACT in suppression of CSC-like phenotypes in NSCLC cells, indicating that they are potential candidates for lung cancer treatment."
